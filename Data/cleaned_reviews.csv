",4.0,Japanese,Omakase Room By Tatsu,7.7,"Tolerance for group trips can vary widely. Some people have an internal meltdown when a company bowling outing is so much as mentioned, while others might be the enthusiastic ringleaders of a family reunion taking place on a cruise ship. We’re skeptical of those people on the cruise ship wavelength, but we also know that doing things with other human beings in an organized manner can sometimes be a good thing.
Omakase Room By Tatsu is a sushi place that’s sort of like a group trip, but without flip flops and nametags and with absolutely zero screaming. At this quiet, below-ground spot in the West Village, you and nine other people will be asked to arrive at precisely 6, 7:30, or 9pm. In the 90 minutes that follow, the 10 of you will receive, almost in unison, 18 pieces of top-quality, simply prepared sushi. You’ll order some sake or wine of your own choosing, but otherwise, this is a sushi meal that follows a close script. Fortunately, the sushi is very good, and you won’t be disappointed in the dozen and a half pieces that get placed in front of you.
While the choreographed, carefully-timed production makes for a nice meal with no real flaws, the strict 90-minute time frame does add pressure, and doesn’t allow for much cushion to finish off your sake leisurely. For $145 before tax and tip, it can feel like a short evening that you’re a bit rushed out of. Especially when your coat is brought over as you’re paying the check.
Of course, in most ways, Omakase Room By Tatsu is absolutely nothing like a group trip. For one, it’s extremely quiet, and there’s no music playing. That, paired with the minimalist space, makes this restaurant feel like a place you should sit up straight, pay attention, and refrain from using curse words.
Omakase Room By Tatsu serves a traditional omakase sushi meal that sushi purists in particular will enjoy. And if someone is nice enough to invite you, you’re in for some expertly-prepared fish. But for the price, there are other places we’d be more likely to go back to for a dinner without the restrained time frame, which are a bit more suited to a celebratory occasion."

",4.0,Japanese,Sushi Azabu,8.5,"When the apocalypse eventually comes for New York City, you’re going to have to find a good basement to bunker down. If you had your pick, where would you go? The underground archives of The Met could be cool. Or the storage area of a Trader Joe’s might be a more strategic choice. Reality is, you’d probably end up in the basement of your own apartment or office building, clutching the water heater for emotional support.
But if we did have a choice of a basement to be stuck in, we’d pick Sushi Azabu.
Of course, plenty of restaurants and bars in NYC are located in basements, but this semi-hidden sushi spot in the quiet cobblestone part of Tribeca really has a particular underground feel. You do get the feeling that if nuclear winter finally started outside while you were eating a piece of fatty toro in Sushi Azabu, you might miss it.
Sushi Azabu serves one of the city’s best sushi omakase meals, and there are a few ways to go about eating here. You can sit at a table, where you can order things like a very good $68 nigiri set, or any number of pieces a la carte. But if you’re coming here, it should be for the experience of the omakase, at the bar. You can order this at a table too, but you’ll miss out on the interactions with the chef that add to the experience.The chef’s omakase is an impressive selection of incredible food that involves small appetizers, soup, sashimi pieces, a “toro tasting,” nigiri pieces, dessert, and a little dish in the middle called “grilled king crab with miso” that is one of the best single pieces of food we’ve eaten in recent memory. The sushi pieces here are good enough that you’ll find yourself wanting to write down the names of the fish in your Notes app, just to remember. They’re seasoned with things like a tiny bit of yuzu zest or a miniscule drop of chive paste, but mostly they highlight the freshness and quality of the fish and the skills of the chef.
At dinner, this costs $170 ($200 if you add an on an uni tasting, or $145 at lunch, during which you’ll also likely get even more of the chef’s attention). There’s also a nigiri-only version for $150, but it’s well worth paying up for the toro and the crab dish. When the bill comes, just tell yourself that maybe the world outside has ended and U.S. currency no longer has any value?Those prices, if it helps at all, also include service, which is excellent here. Upon realizing we were left-handed, a server moved our little hand wipe thing to the left side, and the friendly sushi chefs will also reach over to wipe down your platter regularly throughout the sushi part of the meal, so that each piece can shine.
By the time your meal finishes and you walk up the narrow staircase and back into the street and see that taxis and Tribeca strollers are passing you, you’ll be glad that the world is still intact, and that you can go tell someone about the sushi meal you just finished."

",3.0,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2.0,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20.The last time you were in Penn Station, the most exciting things about the whole experience were the smell of someone else’s Shake Shack and the 20 minutes you spent thinking about how Amtrak should really have a “C.” But next time, you’ll go knowing there’s something nearby you can really look forward to - a spot with food so good you might decide to take the train to Baltimore more often."

",2.0,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3.0,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3.0,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3.0,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1.0,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2.0,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table.On paper, the bar snacks at The Polynesian look similar to dishes you’d get at a Murray Hill rooftop while sharing a couch with the former social chairs of Pi Kappa Alpha’s Georgetown chapter, but the food here is definitely worth snacking on while you drink. The crab rangoon has a thin, flaky shell with filling that’s mostly crab, and the ahi tuna poke is served over seaweed salad that tastes so briny you’ll have flashbacks to swimming face-first into ocean kelp and temporarily freaking out because, you know, the ocean is scary. But the thing that this place does best is actually fries. The crunchy, crinkle-cut fries here are topped with various spices and served with hoisin ketchup, and they belong in any debate about the best fries in the city.
The largest option on the 10-item food menu is a $19 plate of four baby back ribs, so this isn’t the place to have a full dinner. It is a fun rooftop bar to use for snacks and great cocktails when you’re in a part of the city that can make even proud Manhattanites daydream of a brownstone in Park Slope. Get a booth inside and listen to the soundtrack of Supertramp, Pharrell, and Prince with a few coworkers who want a post-work drink stronger than sauvignon blanc, or order something on fire at the outdoor bar when you want to turn things up many notches after date night in the Theater District. Just be sure to mind your hair around the flames."

",2.0,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2.0,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set.One other thing to note about the menu is that the dishes here are generally pretty mild. So if you like your glass of water to taste like it’s vibrating, this probably isn’t the place for you. Otherwise, the large portions and easygoing atmosphere make it a group dinner/date spot in the area that should appeal to just about everyone. Even those who don’t usually enjoy participating in our capitalist economy (this is Bushwick, after all). 
Most neighborhoods have a reliably good place like General Deb’s - Bushwick is just lucky enough to have this particular iteration. If you live in the area, you’ll love the fact that you can come here for a reasonably-priced, casual dinner pretty much anytime you want. And if you’re in the neighborhood to go out, you’ll love the fact that you can start your night with some good Chinese food, chocolate fortune cookies, and a rousing discussion of how much you enjoyed watching Pitch Perfect 3 on your last flight home."

",3.0,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2.0,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4.0,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2.0,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4.0,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4.0,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?And then things will slow down a bit. A hot bowl of soba - cooked with the shabushabu broth - is up next, which makes sense considering that this place is owned by the same people behind the cash-only soba shop Cocoron, a place I like so much that when I bring people there for the first time it feels like introducing them to a significant other.
And finally, you’ll have ice cream for dessert, while some other 2015 pop hit plays, and you’ll probably have some more questions. Maybe you’ll ponder why abalone isn’t more popular, or maybe you’ll wonder how much a shabushabu pot costs on Amazon. But mostly, you’ll ask why so many restaurants are the same, and why it’s so hard to find one that’s actually unique. A meal at Shabushabu Macoron is expensive, but one thing you won’t question is whether the experience was worth it.
One last question: should we all go to that karaoke place?"

",2.0,Thai,Pig And Khao,8.0,"Years ago, you were staring at your ceiling, trying to distract yourself from what happened with Adam in homeroom. In that moment, you started imagining your future life in New York City, and it went something like this: you’d spend every night going out, listening to loud music, ordering food like you’d never heard of money, and drinking criminally pink cocktails. If that vision actually came true, you’d be eating at Pig and Khao all the time.This Thai/Filipino spot on the LES feels like a party, but with flavorful, interesting dishes instead of cocktail weenies and sweaty cubes of gouda. And as with any real party (or any trip to a haunted corn maze), you should come prepared with a small army of people who talk about “fun,” and also actually have it. 
You’ll walk in and get a waft of hot, spicy food as it’s cooking - which is helpful, because otherwise you might think you were in a loud bar or a skateboarding shop (with friendly servers who look like they walked out of a Vans ad). The menu is broken up into “smalls” and “mains,” but the smalls are like tapas for giants - in other words, not small at all. No one should be ordering anything just for themselves, unless it’s a personal order of coconut rice. We like everything we’ve had here, from the excellent pork sisig and the khao soi to the flaky whole fried fish and BBQ baby back ribs covered in a thick, sweet sauce - so plan to share as much as possible with your group. And get some cocktails, like the one with spicy tequila and watermelon or a daiquiri with thai basil rum. Drink a few of those and expect to do some light shoulder dancing in your chair.Since Pig and Khao is a party, and parties are a little chaotic, the service can be inconsistent. Sometimes things come right away, and sometimes you’ll have to make the eyes at your server. Ultimately, it won’t really matter. Because you’ll be eating great, filling food, and talking about which LES bar to go to next. 
Go back in time and tell your younger self that you weren’t too far off with how things would be once you moved to the city. Because now, you’re the kind of person who goes to restaurants like Pig and Khao. Also, remind yourself not to spend too much time worrying about Adam. You know how he turned out."

",4.0,Experimental,Blanca,9.3,"Outer space either terrifies you or excites you. But, unless a part of your soul is missing, you’re at least curious. There’s a whole other world out there, and it’s impossible to know what it looks, feels, sounds, or tastes like. Unless you’re on a first-name basis with Elon Musk, or you built yourself the world’s largest slingshot. 
Blanca, the 19-course tasting menu restaurant hidden in the backyard at Roberta’s, is not outer space. But dinner here is like visiting another planet, and if you can find a way to experience it, you absolutely should.
Your launchpad for this spaceflight is the interior of Roberta’s - the first hipster base on planet Bushwick. You wait in the bar with some other half-nervous, half-excited people, until someone picks you up to lead you to the final frontier. Walking through Roberta’s, you pass giant picnic tables, strings of neon Christmas lights, and Brokeback Mountain pizza art, through a covered patio with a leaky roof, turning past the outdoor tiki bar, out into the giant yard. And then, suddenly, you see it. It’s another door you’ve never noticed before.
This leads to Blanca, a small cement room, filled only with an immaculate white bar, twelve brown leather stools, a sparkling silver kitchen, and a large table covered with dozens of wine glasses. This place doesn’t just feel like it’s a world away from Roberta’s - it feels like it’s a different world.The meal starts with a tiny bowl of caviar and pine nut, and it’s followed by a single paper-thin slice of pancetta. Then there’s maitake mushroom with uni and pear, agnolotti with poppy seeds and goat milk, and creamy pici pasta topped with more uni. Each dish is mind-blowing, and even more so if you opt for the wine pairing - which isn’t really a wine pairing. You’ll go from beer to wine to bubbles back to beer, each glass something you’ve likely never tried before, and you definitely didn’t expect to be served with whatever you’re eating.
About halfway through the meal, a chef brings over an inflated, charred sphere of bread. Like you in your sophomore year of college with a bag of wine, he slaps it. When it pops, it blasts a jet of steam, and flattens. This is your bread course, made from Roberta’s pizza dough. Maybe you’ve eaten it before, but this is is an entirely new experience.It’s one thing to feel like you’re in outer space. It’s another thing to realize that humans put you there. Like the chef who slaps the pizza dough, and another who cooks a steak with more care than we’ve ever seen someone give to a piece of meat. There’s also the sommelier, who has champagne waiting for you when you arrive, who starts drinking with you about halfway through the meal, and who you drunkenly find yourself hugging by the end of the night. (Or maybe that was just us.)
Restaurants that charge several hundred dollars a head can often feel like machines, here to provide you with a technically perfect dinner, but one without a lot of Feel Good Factor. Blanca isn’t a machine - it’s a party. With unexpected, outstanding food, and music to match. The soundtrack is different every night, because it’s selected by one of the chefs, who reads the room in real time, and selects the playlist accordingly. Moving from a plate of pici with uni to ’nduja ravioli, just as the music switches from Jamie XX to Depeche Mode, is the kind of moment that could only happen at Blanca. 
But really, that’s every moment at this restaurant. Dinner is 19 courses, with zero disappointments, and it seems like it’s over in seconds (although, technically, it’s more like four hours). That’s another thing about Planet Blanca: time works differently here. It’s the kind of special occasion experience that makes you feel like nothing exists outside this room. You might as well be off in space. And let us tell you, it’s incredible here."

",3.0,Mexican,La Esquina Brasserie,8.0,"At Disneyland, a corn dog costs roughly $10. Ask someone who isn’t currently at a theme park in Anaheim if that's too much, and that person will probably say yes. But that stranger isn’t factoring in the feeling you get when you’re eating your food in the shadow of the Matterhorn, several feet from a Mickey Mouse impersonator who’s about 75% too happy to see you. At Disneyland, you’re willing to pay more because it’s an experience - and the same can be said of La Esquina.
La Esquina is an upscale Mexican restaurant hidden under a taqueria in Nolita, and when it opened back in 2005, it was where you went to see someone who’d been on the cover of People Magazine. Essentially, it was a cooler version of all the party restaurants in the Meatpacking District today, and when you called for a reservation, you expected to hear a no. Nowadays, some of that can’t-fake-it trendiness has faded - you’ll see a few more tourists here, and it isn’t too hard to get a table online. But there’s still something special about a meal at this place.It starts when you walk inside. To get to the dining room, you give the name on your reservation to a doorman, then walk through a door marked “Employees Only” in the back of a little ground-floor taqueria. Next, you head down a flight of stairs, pass through a kitchen, then wind up in a dark room that looks like a dungeon renovated by a young couple who spotted a fixer-upper. It’s a fun space that tends to be dark and crowded - and if you have enough tequila, you’ll probably start to wonder if you are, in fact, in the brick-walled basement of castle where people come to celebrate everything from 25th birthdays to 20-year anniversaries.
As for the food, it’s similar to what you’d find at a very good neighborhood Mexican restaurant, just a little pricier. The barbacoa tacos are rich and flavorful, the carnitas ones easily earn a passing grade, and the plantains have everything you want from a bowl of fried, starchy bananas. The ceviches and aguachile clock in at just-about-average - so skip them, and order the pork shank instead. It falls right off the bone, and it comes with a side of tortillas that you can use to make DIY tacos.
At $27, that pork shank isn’t cheap - but it’s big enough to share, and you’re not just paying for the food. You’re paying to eat it in a secret basement in Nolita that, unlike Good Charlotte or a popped collar in a yearbook photo, has aged well over 13 years. If it’s your birthday, you can even get a dessert with a giant sparkler in the middle. Do you need this borderline-dangerous firework in your tres leches? Probably not. But it’s part of the experience, and that’s why you come to this taco and tequila-filled dungeon in the first place."

",2.0,Greek,Kiki’s,8.2,"You know that feeling right after you get a new haircut? You walk out of the salon, catch your reflection in a shop window halfway down the block, and the only things in your head are the hairdresser’s compliments and the Getty Image of whoever inspired this new look in the first place. You could go home, send selfies to four people you wish you were dating, and order in $40 worth of delivery for yourself.
But what you really want is to go out somewhere, ideally someplace where people are waiting out front, who you’re annoyed you have to shoulder past to get to the host stand, but all the stares you get from people in designer jumpsuits make it worth it. The problem is, very few places like that serve good food, and even fewer cost the same as delivery and a decent bottle of malbec. Kiki’s is one of those rare spots.
This casual Greek restaurant on the Chinatown/LES border has been packed nightly, often with hour-long waits on weekdays (they don’t take reservations), since it opened in 2015. The crowds mostly look like they’re approaching their 10-year high school reunions, where they’ll show up late and break the ice with stories about who they just met at a Fashion Week afterparty. People are sitting at wooden tables or either of the two bars in the airy space, which feels like it could be a casual family-run spot near the water in Santorini.While the servers are more likely to be young Australians than elderly Greek ladies, the food here is still what you’d expect at a homey Greek restaurant. The uncomplicated, enjoyable dishes range from from lighter options, like smoked eggplant dip or grilled octopus, to heavier ones like melted cheese wrapped in phyllo dough and topped with honey. No matter what else you have on your table, make sure to get the lamb chops. They’re rich and a little charred, and served with an addictive housemade mustard and a mound of nicely spiced fries.
Given the scene and the quality of the food - plus the fact that the portions are pretty big - it’s all the more surprising that this place is relatively inexpensive. The dips and spreads, which come with very good fresh pita, are all $8, and most of the entrees are around $15. They even have a few house wines, and while they’re fairly bland examples of popular Greek varietals, at $24 per liter, you’re not going to be complaining.
Perhaps it’s the surprisingly affordable prices that make this place so popular, or maybe the owners here saw all the designer jumpsuits and decided that people have already spent enough. Either way, Kiki’s is worth the waits, and there’s no shortage of bars on the LES where you can show off that haircut until your table is ready."

You probably won’t find yourself taking photos of anything to show the clerk at your local wine store, but it’s hard to complain about drinking quality French wines for $9-$12 per glass, and the pours are large.
If you’re confident there won’t be any mentions of ESP or past lives as Genghis Khan, and you’re fine with more of a commitment than just drinks, then sit at one of the small tables and get some food. Everything on the small-plates menu here is made behind the bar, and while no particular dish is worth a trip on its own, everything is both shareable and pretty reasonably priced (it’s all under $16). Start with the roasted broccoli over almond pesto or the $8 escargots, and then get the octopus with crispy potatoes and smoky eggplant dip. By the end of the meal, at the very least, you’ll probably know if this is someone you could fall asleep watching documentaries with in the future."

",1.0,Caribbean,Peppa’s Jerk Chicken,7.9,"With all due respect to artisanal bars of soap and yard sale shower radios, the best use of $7 that we know of is a meal at Peppa’s Jerk Chicken in Prospect Lefferts Gardens. There’s no seating at this small, takeout-only Caribbean spot, but the reggae music videos playing on the TV screen and the smells coming from the grill behind the register are more than enough to keep you entertained while you wait for your order. And whether you eat your food on a bench in Prospect Park a block away, or on your couch while you try to remember your mom’s Verizon login, you’ll realize that Peppa’s is twice as delicious and half as expensive as whatever else you typically get delivered to your apartment.
The menu here has a few different Caribbean dishes, but as you might expect based on the name, the jerk chicken is the star. A small portion, which is $7 and definitely enough food for one person, comes in a styrofoam container, and includes several pieces of juicy, smoky chicken over rice and beans. Get a side of hot sauce, but use it with extreme care - it’ll leave your mouth tingling like you just ate a combination of Sichuan peppercorns and Pop Rocks. Also, be sure to add a $1 festival (basically a long, sweet hushpuppy) - or seven, if you can kick your artisanal soap habit."

",2.0,Taiwanese,886,7.8,"Walk into 886, and you’ll be surrounded by neon. There’s neon on the walls, neon on the ceiling, and even a little neon sign out front that would be considered foreshadowing if it were in a novel. All of which seems to suggest that this place is more exciting than your average neighborhood spot - and to a certain extent, it is.
886 is Taiwanese restaurant in the East Village, and the menu here is pretty straightforward. Mostly, it consists of various rice dishes and stir-fries that should satisfy both your stomach and your bank account. There are also a few small plates, like a bowl of scrambled eggs with tomatoes, and a sausage served in a bun made from glutinous rice (called the “Sausage Party”). If you’re going to eat something with a bun, though, make it the fried chicken sandwich. It involves a big piece of crispy fried chicken topped with shredded daikon, and you might find yourself thinking about it the next time you’re vacuuming your apartment, taking the subway to work, or reading a book to one of your many children.The only significant issue we have with 886 is the space. It’s roughly the size of a subway car, and on weekends it can feel like a more-crowded version of the psychedelic boat tunnel from Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. Depending on how many drinks you’ve had and how sensitive you are to restaurant noise, you might be just fine with this. But if you don’t want people brushing up against your back while they search for the restroom, come on a weeknight (and cross your fingers).
The food here isn’t as flashy as all the lights suggest - but a few things are worth a trip, and nothing costs more than $20. So if you can make peace with all the noise and neon, 886 is a solid option for dinner before a night out in the East Village."

",2.0,Mexican,La Morada,8.5,"Options are typically a good thing to have. When you’re shopping for a house, for example, you usually look at more than one. And if you want to watch Teen Wolf, it’s comforting to know that you can choose either the Michael J. Fox or the Jason Bateman version. At La Morada, on the other hand, we almost wish there were fewer choices - because they serve so many things that make us want to get down on one knee and throw a diamond ring at one of the walls.
La Morada is a Mexican restaurant in Mott Haven, specializing in Oaxacan food. It’s just one plain room with purple walls, roughly 10 tables, and the lighting scheme of a dental office - but the service is friendly, the menu is extensive, and choosing what to eat here will be one of the more difficult decisions you make in a year.
The first thing you’ll have to decide on is which of the seven moles to order. The mole poblano is great - but as long as you’re here, you should get one of the less common varieties. If you want something rich, but less sweet than the poblano, get the mole negro. Or if you’d like a mole that’s nutty, mild, and the color of Cool Whip, go for the blanco. And if it’s been a while since you felt something, try mole Oaxaqueno. It’s the color of a Ferrari at sunset, and the cloves inside will make you think about December while you simultaneously notice that your mouth is starting to burn.These seven moles are only a fraction of the dishes you can eat here. La Morada also serves tortas, tostadas, bacon-wrapped shrimp, crispy gorditas stuffed with your choice of filling, and some excellent tacos on homemade tortillas - the al pastor ones are like warm little gifts filled with pork. And if you’d like to temporarily own a large number grilled things in a big stone bowl, you can get a molcajete. It’ll come with a few different vegetables, some grilled cheese, and your choice of two meats, all in a sauce that you’ll want to eat with a spoon.
At this point, we’ve only mentioned a few the of dishes we like at La Morada - because you probably have things to do, and you can’t stare at this screen all day. But the good news is that it isn’t hard to get a table here. So if you live in the South Bronx, stop by for a casual meal. And if you don’t, know that it’s worth a trip. The first time you see the menu, you might experience anxiety, indecision, and a pain between your eyes that’s really just a combination of your anxiety and indecision - but if the choice is too hard, just pick something at random. By the time you’re done eating whatever it is, you’ll be ready for a long-term relationship with this place."

",3.0,French,Manhatta,8.5,"Traditional fine dining restaurants are, at their core, pretty similar. Sure, some have menus where every dish is sourced from a different time zone, and others only serve what they can forage next to local highways. But in general, this category is marked by white tablecloths, exorbitant prices, and clientele in blazers sipping Sauternes from the year of their first divorce. But Manhatta is an exception. This French restaurant in Fidi both looks better and costs less than the vast majority of New York City’s fine dining options.
Manhatta has a lot in common with other spots from Danny Meyer’s restaurant group, like Union Square Cafe and Gramercy Tavern, except for one major difference: it’s 60 floors up. The multi-room space, which encircles an open kitchen, has floor-to-ceiling windows with panoramic views of rivers, bridges, and skyscrapers that tourists will point to thinking they’re looking at The Chrysler Building while you understand they’re just apartments that require guarantors who have offshore bank accounts.Before you even get in the elevator, you’ll experience your first dose of the excellent service here as hosts escort you through the ground-floor lobby. Once upstairs, the staff in the bar area (reserved for walk-ins and people who want to take in the views before their meal) appear out of nowhere just as you realize you’d like another drink. And throughout the course of your dinner in the dining room, you’ll be helped by a team of servers who can tell you how each dish is prepared and the ones they’re most excited about, all while smiling in a way that makes you think they genuinely enjoy being here. The huge wine list has plenty of bottles with prices that’ll make you ask if this grape juice is served in a gold chalice or comes with a blessing from someone who blesses things - but the sommeliers are just as happy to recommend $55 bottles of Montepulciano or Beaujolais.
The views and service are the first things that’ll impress you about Manhatta, but once you’ve settled in you’ll also appreciate the smaller details. Like the fact that this restaurant - an attractive space located at the cruising altitude of a hot air balloon - has enough room between tables that you could drive a car through it. Other special touches include cushions underneath the tables to keep the decibel level down, tastes of wines-by-the-glass offered in different types of Zalto (a.k.a. very fancy) wine glasses, and binoculars on the windowsills.While the setting at Manhatta is unlike anything else in the city, we can’t say the same of the menu. It’s a three-course prix fixe, and you can choose from around six fairly traditional French dishes for each course. Almost all of them are very well-executed, but none of them is particularly exciting. It’s a little disappointing that a place with such a ridiculous setting has, overall, pretty predictable food. 
The good news: while nothing you eat here will keep you up at night, neither will any sense of buyer’s remorse. The prix fixe is $78, hospitality included - and when you’re halfway through a wagyu bavette and bottle of French malbec, with foie gras behind you and vanilla souffle ahead, looking out on the city like you’re experiencing Google Earth in VR, you’re going to think that’s a pretty good deal.
By the time your server puts down after-dinner canelés with your check, you’ll be both full and, technically, richer than you would be after eating at similar fine dining restaurants around the city. Unlike many of those others, we would recommend Manhatta to just about anyone - but in case you’re here to toast your first divorce, know that the oldest Sauternes on the menu is from 2003."

",2.0,Malaysian,Kopitiam,7.9,"You probably walk around the city with a few different mental lists. Maybe you have one list of the people you actively avoid, another list of bodegas that don’t have cats (or do, depending on how you feel about cats lurking behind stacks of paper towels), and one more involving casual places that serve really good, affordable food where you could show up anytime. If you spend any portion of your waking life downtown, Kopitiam belongs on that third list.This all-day Malaysian cafe used to have a small location on Canal Street serving mainly sweets and drinks, and a very short list of savory snacks (though you couldn’t spend much time sitting down to eat them, since there were only three or four seats). That old place closed in 2017, and the new location not only has at least four times as much space, but also a much more extensive menu, and the kind of atmosphere we’d recommend for any type of low-key meal - not just takeout lunch or coffee and a snack.
To be clear, the new Kopitiam is still very casual. You order from a laminated menu at the counter, take a number, get your own silverware and bowls, eat happily, and then bus your table. You might see some families, some people on dates, and some solo diners on dates with their phones - all of whom are there for the same reason you are. To hang out and eat some some affordable food that’s good enough to hold its own against what you’d find at more expensive full-service restaurants.That food ranges widely, there’s buttered toast and chicken wings to noodle soups and desserts. Since Kopitiam serves food all day, you can get breakfast - which includes everything from fish ball soup to sugary Malaysian-style French toast - anytime. And starting at lunchtime, there’s even more to choose from. Like spicy cold sesame noodles, an oyster omelette, and a rice dish with dried fish that comes wrapped in a banana leaf. Overall, the best things Kopitiam makes are light, with a combination of sweet and salty flavors. A great example of this is the pan mee soup, which has wide hand-pulled noodles, bits of pork, a sweet anchovy broth, and enough dried fish to use as bait to catch another, larger fish. It’s our favorite thing here.
So the next time you get hungry in between avoiding the people on your first mental list and the cats on your second, remember that Kopitiam belongs at the top of your third  (the list of casual places you could go anytime to eat something really good). It might even inspire you to come up with a new mental list - of reasons to come back here."

",2.0,American,West-Bourne,8.3,"You’re in a room, and everything is white, like a lazy screenwriter’s version of heaven. The only furniture is a coffee table covered in brochures - so you pick one up, and it’s full of happy people who look like they’ve never worn anything wrinkled and always have the proper amount of Vitamin B12. “Go to West-Bourne,” it says. And, while a part of you is skeptical, you can’t help but feel a little warm and fuzzy inside. This, in a nutshell, is the West-Bourne experience.
West-Bourne is a California-themed counter-service cafe in Soho where you’ll want to hang out after you finish your food and the majority of things taste like they were designed to make you a better person. It’s entirely vegetarian, and after a meal here, you’ll feel like you took a brief trip to a world where everything is made with care and people smile more often than they should.
Walk inside, and you’ll find a fridge stocked with juice and rosé. Next to that, there are some shelves full of branded t-shirts, tote bags, and napkins made from “reclaimed denim.” The rest of the little space is filled with some communal tables, a counter surrounded by little wooden stools, and a window nook with an excessive number of throw pillows. Factor in the brick walls and wooden ceiling beams, and the whole place makes your average counter-service spot look like a dumpster fire in a field of other dumpster fires.The first time you see West-Bourne, you might even assume it’s the sort of restaurant where the food is an afterthought. But everything here is fresh and flavorful, and even the healthiest things are worth your time. The “Over The Rainbowl,” for example, is mostly just a bunch of pickled and raw vegetables with lentil falafel - but it’s good and filling, and will help you picture an alternate universe in which you grow your own food. The rest of the menu consists of things like honey-roasted eggplant and shaved cauliflower with sheep’s cheese, as well as some less-healthy options like a mushroom reuben and sweet potatoes that taste like they’re about 50% butter. Those last two items aren’t as healthy as the rest, but all of these dishes are consistently excellent and more ambitious than what you expect from a place where you bus your own table. 
As an added bonus, West-Bourne donates 1% of its sales to a nearby nonprofit, which is just one more reason why you should get a quick breakfast or lunch here the next time you’re downtown. Sure, it can get a little crowded, and all the pillows and custom denim napkins might cause you to black out momentarily and have a nightmare about a world in which we live our entire lives on social media. But the service is friendly, the food is great, and you feel happier when you leave. Possibly because you now have the right levels of Vitamin B12."

",3.0,American,Holy Ground,7.8,"Some things are slightly unconventional, like putting scotch in an Old Fashioned, or sleeping with your socks on. But others don’t seem to fit into any mold at all - like the movie The Room, or you, according to your mother. Or Holy Ground. Come here to have an unusual dining experience - but just know that some of its surprises are less enjoyable than others. 
The best part about Holy Ground is the setting. It’s in a very cool underground space in Tribeca with red leather booths, low ceilings, and vintage speakers playing instrumental jazz. But while plenty of steakhouses in the city feel like spots where F. Scott Fitzgerald could be at the next table drinking gin and casually lighting other people’s cigarettes, Holy Ground isn’t quite like any of those. Mainly because it isn’t actually a steakhouse.Holy Ground focuses on slow-smoked meats, serving the types of cuts you typically find at counter-service BBQ places: pork shoulder, brisket, and racks of spare ribs, along with sides like collard greens and mac and cheese. But this is also not a typical BBQ spot. There are red cloth napkins instead of paper ones, $16 cocktails instead of canned beer, and the brisket is wagyu. Plus, the primary flavors in most dishes here come from sauces rather than the meat, bark, or smoke.
Besides going in with the understanding that Holy Ground is neither a steakhouse nor a typical BBQ joint, it’s also important to order correctly. Stay away from the tough slab of pork shoulder, and don’t blow your tax refund on the chewy prime rib (which costs $120). Instead, go with the rich beef rib and the sweet and smoky chicken. Most importantly, get one or four orders of the crispy potatoes, which are served over a pool of mustard aioli - this side dish is the best thing here.Other parts of the experience are less enjoyable. In a Tribeca spot where you’re paying twice as much as usual for most of the cuts of meat on the menu, you’d at least expect the staff to be helpful, if not particularly friendly. Instead, the hosts remind us a little of apathetic antagonists from ‘90s teen movies, and servers disappear for long stretches of time and don’t have much to offer when asked about the wine and food. Rather than making this place feel trendy or exclusive, it all just comes off as unwelcoming and disorganized.
Inconsistent service and menu misses aside, if you order correctly and go in with the right expectations, it’s still easy to have a good night at Holy Ground. Walk down the steps into a space that feels a century old, drink a sazerac at the bar while reminding yourself that you should get more into jazz, and fill the table in front of your red leather booth with cuts of meat you’ve only ever eaten off wax paper. It’s not a flawless eating experience - but it’s unique. Even your mother would give it points for that."

",3.0,Mexican,The Black Ant,5.8,"When people ask if you want the good news or the bad news first, there’s really no right answer. Would you rather find out first that your dachshund went on a long vacation, or that your parents replaced it with a poodle? Where The Black Ant is concerned, we’ll start with the good news.
This upscale Mexican spot has been around in the East Village since 2014, and it’s still an enjoyable place to hang out. The servers are always friendly, and not in a way that makes you think they had a two-week boot camp on how to smile politely and fold napkins. They make conversation, pour big glasses of wine, and dance to the music coming from the speakers - which is played at that goldilocks volume where Shazam only takes a second to recognize a song, but you can still clearly hear your date’s response to your question about which wild animal they’d want most as a pet. If you only come here to drink the cocktails, which are mostly spicy and all great, then you’ll probably have a very good time. The problem is that this place isn’t a bar. It’s a restaurant, and the food just isn’t very good.The tacos come on decent housemade tortillas, but you’ll be more eager to finish those than the stuff inside them. The few slices of pineapple in the pineapple tacos have had all the sweetness grilled out of them, and two bites in, you’ll be $14 poorer with a couple of half-eaten, bare tortillas left on your plate. The fish tacos have a lot more going on, with slaw and spicy aioli, but the swordfish ranges from being really fishy and barely breaded, to all breading and very little bland fish.
Things only go downhill as you move on to the larger dishes, which include a dry chicken breast, mushy octopus, and some duck dumplings with almost no duck. Most entrees go too heavy on salt, spice, and sauces, which overwhelm everything else on the plate. The one-note duck dumplings taste strictly like the chocolatey mole they’re doused in, and the octopus is salty enough to dry your mouth out for the rest of the night. 
So that’s the bad news, but just as a reminder, there was good news too. The Black Ant is still a solid place for Happy Hour, or rounds of smoky jalapeno margaritas outside with a friend. If don’t enjoy those things, then there’s not much we can offer, besides our condolences for your dachshund."

",3.0,Mexican,Oxomoco,8.1,"You never really know whether it’s going to be a great night. That magic comes from unpredictable factors, like who you end up meeting, what music is playing, and whether your cool pants fit. But Oxomoco, an upscale Mexican restaurant in Greenpoint, is the kind of place that lays the rest of the groundwork for you.
If you like to mitigate risk at every opportunity, you can make a reservation. If you don’t, you’ll probably encounter a wait. But fortunately, this doesn’t mean you have to go into fight-or-flight mode, frantically searching for a plan B to salvage your night. Instead, you can hang on the front patio if the weather’s nice, or at the long indoor bar if it’s not. The cocktail list is one of the best things about this place, and there are drinking snacks like spiced mango and lime and chile popcorn to keep you from getting hangry. One crucial step at this point is ordering a frozen margarita or paloma. It’ll come in a glass that’s half the size of your head, and if you’re looking to set the tone for your night, this is how you do it.Once your table is ready inside, you’ll be glad you waited. The dining room is a high-ceilinged space that’s covered in white paint and green plants, which doesn’t make it unique. But some other things do: the big round booths that make you feel like it’s your birthday even if it’s not, the chef’s counter overlooking the wood-fired grill, and the kind of good lighting typically only achieved with a filter.None of this would matter if it all ended in disappointing food. But that won’t happen here, as long as you primarily focus on the grilled dishes. Oxomoco is owned by the people behind Speedy Romeo, a pizza restaurant that makes all of its dishes over open fire, and the best things at Oxomoco are cooked in the same way - like the pollo a las brasas. It’s a grilled half-chicken that comes to your table covered in salsa and pickled onions, with sides of housemade tortillas and crispy red rice you will want to shovel into your mouth as quickly as possible. 
That chicken setup is our favorite way to eat tacos at Oxomoco, but a few of the ones listed in the actual taco section of the menu come close - like the lamb barbacoa, the beet chorizo, and the masa tempura shrimp. Otherwise, there are some raw fish starters, which you don’t need to be ordering unless you have a taco allergy. You do, however, need to be ordering the tlayuda - a pizza-sized tortilla topped with melted cheese, crema, grilled corn, hot sauce, and fresh herbs. Even if the rest of your night involves meeting someone who shares your interest in sloths, or Jerry Seinfeld cutting you in the bathroom line, or dancing on a table while singing along to ABBA (as sung by Cher), this tlayuda is what you’ll wake up thinking about tomorrow.
The tlayuda is also one of the most affordable dishes on a menu that overall feels slightly overpriced. The guacamole is $14 (the same price as one of the cocktails) and three fish tacos will set you back $24. We say this to you now, because it’s the only real thing at Oxomoco that runs the risk of ruining the fact that you’re three giant margaritas in, and you look good in those pants. Now go enjoy the rest of your night."

",4.0,Steaks,Peter Luger Steak House,8.4,"Think about your New York City bucket list. Skip past the inherent morbidity of bucket lists, and ignore the exact logistics or legality it’ll take to check things off it. Maybe you want to hide in the Natural History Museum bathroom at close and spend the night looking up at that massive whale, or fake a wedding proposal to get on the jumbotron at a Yankees game, or dress up as a ninja turtle and explore the city’s sewer system. There’s another thing that should definitely be on that list: have dinner at Peter Luger Steak House. 
This Williamsburg spot has been around since 1887, and everything about it seems to be from a time when restaurants worried less about rising rents and more about prohibition agents. From the bow-tied bartender with slicked-back hair and a mustache, who fills tumblers of whiskey while people wait for their tables, to the regulars who order without looking at the menu, to servers saying “no credit cards” as they toss branded chocolate gold coins onto the table with the check - Peter Luger is an experience unlike any other you’ll find in the city. 
People who call this place kitschy aren’t too cool for Peter Luger. They’re just missing the point. Peter Luger is for everybody, and you can see that as soon as you look around at the crowd. Unlike the clientele at a lot of Manhattan steakhouses, which can feel like SuitSupply showrooms, Peter Luger draws everyone from tourists on their honeymoon taking pictures with the menu to groups who have been coming after every Jets win since 1969 to M&A teams talking about the deal they closed as though they just sacked Rome. And all of those people realize this place is an institution.The overall experience is the reason Peter Luger should be on your bucket list, but the food - generally, a barrage of red meat - will leave you hoping Deepak Chopra starts endorsing high-fat diets. Start with a couple sides of extra thick bacon, and then move on to the main attraction: the porterhouse. Old-school servers put thick slices of filet and sirloin on your plate, and then spoon juices from the meat and melted butter on top. It’s by far the best cut at Luger, and it belongs in any conversation about the best steaks in the city.
The sirloin and ribeye are prepared the same way as the porterhouse - dry-aged and cooked just with salt and butter - but they’re not as good on their own. That’s where the big gravy boats of Peter Luger Sauce come in handy. Between this steak sauce, which we’ve been putting on steak and chicken and pasta (and pretty much everything else) since we were old enough to open the fridge, and the pool of juices at the base of each plate of meat, there are no bad bites here. 
After you soak up all those pools of juices with onion bread, your server might suggest one more thing before bringing the hot fudge sundae: pick up the dry-aged t-bone in your hands and gnaw the last of the meat off the bone. And with that, you’ve officially crossed Peter Luger off your bucket list."

",2.0,Italian,Ammazzacaffè,7.9,"In a certain sense, Ammazzacaffè is like the wardrobe that leads to Narnia. From the street, this Williamsburg spot doesn’t look like much - but walk inside, and you’ll find a big space with high ceilings, tiled floors, and candlelit tables. Behind that, there’s a nice backyard surrounded by a brick wall. Factor in the above-average food, and you’ll leave wondering why you didn’t know about this place sooner.
The menu here is Italian, but there isn’t any cacio e pepe or carbonara. Instead, there’s agnolotti with almond pesto, reginette with pancetta and caciocavallo, and a few other pastas that you won’t see everywhere else. There are also small plates and mains that, for the most part, are better and more interesting than what you’ll find at your average neighborhood Italian spot. Ammazzacaffè’s take on a caesar salad, for example, comes covered in bottarga, and their duck comes on a big pile of farro with some chicken and duck liver mousse underneath. It’s rich, salty, and tastes like something you’d make for Thanksgiving after you had a few drinks and thought, “Let’s do something different this year.”If it’s nice out, have your food in the backyard. It’s full of little wooden picnic tables with strings of lights overhead, and it’s one of our favorite low-key outdoor dining options in Williamsburg. The inside is similarly impressive, with hanging light bulbs, exposed brick, and a couple of small dining rooms separated by an open kitchen. The best part is that you can get a table here any night. 
For the moment at least, not a lot of people seem to know about Ammazzacaffè - and you should take advantage of this. Sure, dinner can get a little pricey (pastas are around $20, and the least expensive main is $29), but this isn’t an every-night kind of place. Use it as a solid backup plan when you forgot to book a table in advance, and be sure to end your meal with an amaro (they have over 60 different kinds). Taken together, the food, space, and relaxed atmosphere make this place a secret well worth knowing about. Much like a magical wardrobe that should be kept out of the reach of children."

",1.0,Mediterranean,Zizi Limona,7.8,"Knowing another language isn’t exactly an exceptional skill. People won’t wave you over at cocktail parties saying, “You all have to meet Barry - he speaks French!” But it is something that’s generally pretty useful. Which makes it a lot like Zizi Limona, a Middle Eastern spot in Williamsburg that’s not the most exciting place in the neighborhood, but still comes in handy for lots of different occasions.
Zizi Limona looks like countless other casual restaurants nearby, with an interior heavy on wood and exposed brick, a small bar lined with wine bottles, and a couple of tables on the sidewalk outside. But unlike other unmemorable neighborhood spots where you’d only eat if Time Warner gave you a three-hour arrival window and you needed to stay close by, you’ll actually look forward to having a meal here.One reason why is that the food is really good. There’s a selection of small plates to start with - like crunchy little squares of falafel over curry yogurt, or a light, creamy hummus topped with a pool of olive oil - and you could easily make a meal out of just those, especially since they come with as much complimentary fresh pita as you want. But you should share some of the large plates as well. Our favorite is the shawarma: a huge portion of hummus, chickpeas, and charred onions topped with strips of spiced chicken and lamb, and some green tahini on top. Whether you’re with vegetarians or people who like getting multiple types of meat on a single plate, there are options for everyone. 
Plus, the environment works just as well for a casual dinner with your parents as it does for a first dinner date. You could come with a big group, or sit at the 10-seat bar and have a healthy solo meal while trying to figure out the deal with this playlist of Janet Jackson, M.I.A, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Regardless, you’ll be served by genuinely friendly staff who’ll make you comfortable no matter how much you order or how long you hang out.
This place is in the heart of Williamsburg, a few blocks from Bedford Ave and a short walk from the Lorimer L stop. So the next time you need to choose a spot for dinner before seeing a show at the The Knitting Factory or drinking too many pina coladas at The Commodore, remember that Zizi Limona is here, and will probably work perfectly for whatever you need."

On an average night here, you’ll see families eating in one corner, a group of Dutch tourists in another, and lots of date nights, all with an open kitchen in the background. But if you listen closely, you’ll hear a similar iteration of the same thing being said at every table around you. “Holy sh*t, this is good.”
From the day Di An Di opened, this Vietnamese spot in the middle of Greenpoint has been packed. That alone would have made Di An Di a rarity a few years ago, when convincing someone to travel to this notoriously-inconvenient neighborhood was like asking them to meet you for dinner in Terminal 2 at JFK. But now, Greenpoint is simply a place where everyone wants to hang out. And they all want to be at Di An Di.
Walk into Di An Di, and besides a line of people waiting at the host stand, you’ll see a lot of plants, a lot of pastel pink, and a lot of Scandinavian-looking furniture. And you might think, that’s why everyone’s here. It looks cool.And sure, it’s a very attractive place, and plants never hurt. But the real draw here is the incredible food. The menu covers a spectrum of Vietnamese cooking, with traditional dishes on one end, original Di An Di inventions on the other, and a lot of classics with a twist in the middle. There are bánh xèo-wrapped summer rolls stuffed with grilled pork, turmeric catfish that comes to your table in a sizzling cast iron skillet, and a shredded chicken salad that’s very quietly waiting for the moment when everyone realizes it’s one of the best things here. And the Pho Thin, packed with perfectly-cooked noodles, brisket, and scallions, and topped with an egg yolk, is one of our favorite bowls of soup in the city.If you’re coming here by yourself, you can sit at the bar, order a cocktail or sake and any of the soups, and walk out with a better worldview than you had 45 minutes earlier. But the best way to experience this restaurant is to come with people and order a lot. You won’t have to spend a crazy amount of money to fill every inch of your table, so that there’s barely enough room for the carousel of homemade sauces you can try with every dish. And that’s exactly what you should be doing here.
So yeah, Di An Di is going to be loud, and probably also crowded. If that’s a problem for you, make a reservation, and if it’s not, use this opportunity to wait things out at one of the great bars nearby. Once you’re seated, it’ll be worth whatever commute or amount of patience it took you to get here. And, in addition to the tables around you, make sure you listen to the specials. You’re going to want to order those too."

",2.0,Japanese,Nonono,8.3,"At some point, you’ve probably experienced ordering anxiety. You stare at a menu with seven dishes that sound promising, trying to picture the future you want for yourself. Just as you start to forget how to read and who you are, the server comes over. You pick one $27 entree like you’re going to ask for its hand in marriage, then spend the next 20 minutes trying not to look distracted while your friend reenacts her phone call with the cable company and you consider changing your order.
At Nonono, there’s no need to worry about pledging your eternal soul to the wrong thing, because you won’t be ordering just one dish. You’ll be ordering 10. This Japanese restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Her Name is Han and Take 31 (two Korean restaurants we really like) has a menu so huge and reasonably priced that you can basically get as much as you want, like you’re some prince or person with a credit card problem.If an LSAT study book were replaced with photographs of Japanese food, it would look a lot like the menu here. It comes in a little binder, and side effects of flipping through it include not listening to what anyone is saying to you and an intense urge to order too much food. There’s a lot to choose from - 40 or so yakitori skewers, plus everything from fried chicken and ramen to sushi - and almost nothing costs more than $15.
You’ll be tempted to get something from every section, and the good news is that you probably can - especially if you’re with a group. The yakitori skewers are mostly $3 or $4 each, and your options range from various chicken parts to beef, pork, fish, and vegetables (including an entire skewer of garlic). They’re seasoned and then cooked on a grill that you see as you walk in, and while these skewers are the main attraction, Nonono’s many other dishes are equally affordable and great for sharing. Some of our favorites are the tori liver pate with ginger and a rainbow sushi roll that comes with grated parmesan on top. Just be aware that the food will arrive at your table almost immediately, and pretty much all at the same time - so if you hate slow service, you’ll love it here, and if you get overwhelmed easily, consider ordering a little at a time.
If you wanted to try every single thing on Nonono’s menu, you’d have to make eating here your side hustle. And we fully endorse that. Instead of suffering from ordering anxiety, you’ll enjoy the thrill of trying lots of different, excellent things, every time. We’ll keep coming back to Nonono until that feeling gets old."

",4.0,French,Frenchette,8.4,"In addition to artists, writers, and that guy who walks around with a cat on his head in Nolita, downtown Manhattan is and has been home to a handful of truly legendary French bistros. They’re the kind of places that get 12-page Vanity Fair oral histories, and which go into the history books as neighborhood-defining and decade-describing. There’s Florent (1985-2008), which basically made the Meatpacking District a thing. There’s The Odeon (1980-present), which basically made Tribeca a thing, and where Andy Warhol and Basquiat hung out, and where a lot of celebrities apparently did drugs in the basement in the 80s. And there’s Balthazar (1997-present), which hit Soho in the middle of its transformation from a place artists lived to a place where tourists take pictures in front of a Prada store.
And now there’s Frenchette (born 2018), located just a few blocks up from The Odeon, operated by owners who worked at Balthazar when it opened. While it’s tough to say whether Frenchette will be talked about decades from now, this is definitely a downtown French bistro that’s emblematic of its time. Because rather than doing cocaine in a bathroom, people at Frenchette are discussing obscure natural wines from the Jura and eating blowfish tails.
Welcome to New York in 2018, where the food is delicious but pricey, and the wine has names like “Le Groll and Roll.”Frenchette’s food is a mix of modern and traditional French. Things definitely don’t veer into the fusion or experimental category at all, but you also won’t be eating a tuna tartare or an onion soup or a burger here. Instead, you’ll find dishes like escargots served with soft scrambled eggs or spaghetti with shaved bottarga or a tortilla espanola with trout roe. We’d recommend springing for the truly exceptional lobster, and going for the duck over the steak if you want something that involves frites. You should also be sure to try a few of the smaller “amuses,” or one of the rotating seafood appetizers listed on the left of the menu. These options get changed up seasonally, and the dishes we’ve had, like a little mortadella brioche sandwich or razor clams, have been great.
To go with your food, there’s the wine, which you should know a bit about before coming here. The list focuses on natural wines produced without sulfites, mostly from France, frequently involving obscure grape varieties, and as a result tends to require both some guidance and an open mind. If you’re used to ordering your go-to big Napa Cab or Chianti Classico, don’t expect to see anything like that on the long list here. On the other hand, if the words “funky” and “chilled red” are already in your wine vocabulary, you’ll be right at home.
Alternately, if you don’t know much about wine other than that you like it, just smile and nod when the server suggests something that sounds like “Pinot Denise” and wonder if that’s a wine label your aunt’s book club just started. The servers’ recs can lean pricey in our experience, so feel free to be firm in stating you don’t want to spend as much, because there are a handful of bottles under $60 too. Maybe you’ll discover you really enjoy these often light and tart wines, maybe you’ll think they taste like hay and kombucha.You should come to Frenchette for the food (and maybe the wine, but that’s going to have to be your call), but you’ll want to stay and come back because of the classic French bistro energy. It’s loud and crowded, but you definitely get that “yep, we’re in New York” feeling that very few places manage to nail. While Frenchette can quickly get expensive and feel like a scene, it never feels too formal. You might have people in suits on one side of you, people in jeans on the other, and someone wearing a designer cape elsewhere in the room.
Will there someday be a magazine feature about Frenchette? Probably not, and that’s partially because magazines won’t even exist. But in the meantime, if you want to get in on the action and eat some pretty excellent food, this is a very good place to do it."

",2.0,American,MeMe’s Diner,8.1,"Diners are, above all, anonymous. Some make better pancakes than others, some have stickier booths than others, and some have more tourists taking photos than regulars with standing orders. But when you walk into a New York City diner, you could pretty much be in any New York City diner. 
Except for this one. When you walk into MeMe’s, you could only be at MeMe’s - a Prospect Heights diner that’s not like any other NYC diner. 
Sure, there’s a wraparound booth, layer cake in a glass case on the bar, and meatloaf and a patty melt on the menu. But otherwise, MeMe’s just looks like an attractive, slightly retro neighborhood spot, minimally decorated save for some globe lights, potted plants, and a wall full of portraits that seem like they should be at The Whitney. If all that makes it sound serious, you should know that the first thing you’ll receive at MeMe’s is a complimentary bowl of cheese balls. And cheese balls, like endorphins, make you happy.What really makes MeMe’s a diner isn’t its design. It’s the fact that it’s filled with all different kinds of people. And those people seem, generally, about 65% happier than the average New Yorker, at least while they’re here. That probably has something to do with MeMe’s mission (besides being a great restaurant) - the owners have spoken about their efforts to make the space as inclusive as possible, particularly for the LGBTQ community. The result is a genuinely comfortable, relaxed place we’d recommend to just about anyone.Like any good diner, MeMe’s also serves food that just about anyone would want to eat. But MeMe’s comfort food tastes better, fresher, and more exciting than the usual patty melt, pancake, or even pickles you’ll find at most diners (even good ones). If you think a fried chicken salad isn’t worth traveling for, then you haven’t had this one. We’ve spent many sad office lunches at the bodega salad counter trying to figure out how to replicate the combination of super-fresh vegetables, perfectly breaded and fried cutlet, and green goddess dressing MeMe’s should sell by the gallon. But when you’re sitting at MeMe’s, you’re not going to want to analyze how they make this food so good. You’re just going to want to enjoy it.
We usually go by the rule that the best diner is the diner that’s closest to you. But MeMe’s is a diner you should go out of your way for. After buying a tub of cheese balls on Amazon."

",3.0,French,Ruffian,8.4,"Ruffian is a place that can be enjoyed on a lot of different levels.
On the surface, this tiny wine bar in the East Village is a bit of a sensory overload. The food is all cooked behind the bar in full view of everyone, which fills the narrow, 19-seat space with smells of toasting bread and frying bacon. This, coupled with a list of funky wines and some loud hip hop, is more than enough to keep you entertained if you’re just here to drink some wine without thinking too hard about it. And while you can certainly enjoy yourself having a drink and listening to Mobb Deep on the speakers, that’s only the first rung on the Ruffian ladder.
We’d recommend going at least a step further, by diving into the short food menu. There are usually about 10 items to choose from, most sized somewhere between an appetizer and an entree. You’ll find things like a corn soup with a curry base, and perfectly cooked octopus served over a rich, spicy mole - all of which are more interesting and delicious than you’d expect for a place whose kitchen basically consists of a guy behind the bar with a hot plate.The next step is to explore more of the huge, natural-wine-focused wine list. The over 250 options are almost all from small producers in southern and eastern Europe, but unlike other natural wine-focused spots that require you to have taken a Great Courses Plus on offbeat varietals and appellations, Ruffian categorizes their wines with terms that are actually helpful (or at least entertaining). So rosés are split into “Beach Sipping” and “Stoop Sipping,” red wines have categories like “Rootsy” or “Kool-Aid,” and Champagnes get labels like “Central Park” or “Tompkins Park.” You can tell your server you want to try a red wine from the “Bloody” section of the menu, and they’ll ask if you want something straightforward or “funky as f*ck” before telling you both are great and offering tastes of each.
Beyond the descriptors on the menu, Ruffian generally offers a more creative way to think about wine. For example, on a recent visit, the bartender told us that for the next few weeks, their wines by-the-glass would only be from locations mentioned in stories from The Odyssey, which led to some questionable recall of 11th grade English class as well as a discussion about orange wines from the Peloponnese. This may be the last level to Ruffian - but we wouldn’t be surprised if in the future, we discovered something else. The best part about this place is that you’ll enjoy it whether you want to go that deep, or just hang at the bar while you drink and Shazam Big Pun songs."

",4.0,French,Balthazar,8.1,"Balthazar isn’t just a restaurant. It’s a legend.
For certain people, the place has its own mythology - origin stories of how the modern French bistro came to exist and tales of a simpler time, when media executives had 24/7 black car service, and relevancy. Most of those people tend to be old-school food writers and people who have lived in Soho for no less than twenty years, but we get it. This restaurant has an important place in this city’s dining history.
The good news, however, is that you do not need to “get it” to enjoy a meal at Balthazar. You just need to be the kind of person who appreciates a good escargot, a mouthful of frites, and a bottle of wine that would certainly cost less elsewhere.
Aside from lore, a meal at Balthazar comes with immutable truths. It will be expensive. It will be crowded, no matter when you visit. The crowd will be a mix of tourists, locals, and more tourists. The service will be friendly but somewhat disinterested - maybe because of all the tourists. But by no means is this just a tourist attraction. Balthazar is still the best French bistro in town, and one of New York City’s most reliable restaurants. It’s Perfect For nearly everything, from breakfast with a client, to brunch with friends, to 5pm with your kids in tow. We also love it for a late-night meal - especially the kind that’s meant to serve as redemption for the first dinner of the night that left everyone disappointed.
Regardless of why you’re there, Balthazar is the kind of place that will ideally give you some stories of your own. We all need a little bit of mythology in our lives. That, and a huge pile of frites."

",2.0,Latin,My Cuban Spot,8.1,"Elaborate tableside service, cocktail programs that could have been developed by Bill Nye, restaurant build-outs that cost as much as that diamond Rose threw into the ocean in Titanic - there are so many things going on at some restaurants that it can be easy to forget that the main focus should be what’s actually on the menu. My Cuban Spot, a takeout window in Gowanus, is a reminder that if a place serves excellent food, the rest of that stuff doesn’t really matter.
The options here mostly consist of rice bowls topped with beans and various meats and spices, plus Cuban sandwiches, all of which come on heavily-buttered, slightly-charred, pressed bread. The Cubano is made with slow-roasted pork that’s super rich, and every ingredient balances out to make this one of our favorite sandwiches in Brooklyn. But if you have any plans in the immediate future beyond watching Planet Earth slumped on your couch with your hand on your stomach, you can opt for a bowl instead without being disappointed - the “Oink Oink Babe” has the same juicy, rich, salty pork, but in a somewhat lighter format topped with a fantastic fried sweet plantain.Space-wise, this spot is just a window on the sidewalk. So after ordering, you can bring your food to one of two small tables or take it to-go. Which is fine, because you could eat these Cuban sandwiches and rice bowls in the aisle of a commuter train at 5pm on a summer Friday and you’d still enjoy them. Although you’d probably make the people around you pretty jealous. 
Nothing on the menu here costs more than $12, and even though the portions are large, you shouldn’t overlook sides like crispy empanadas filled with guava and cheese. Basically, you’re going to get some very good food at My Cuban Spot no matter what you order. Sometimes, that’s really all you need."

",2.0,Pizza,Beebe’s,7.2,"Some restaurants aim for the stars, like John Glenn and Alan Shepard in the early days of NASA. Others just try a few new tricks, like a pilot doing a barrel roll. Beebe’s, on the other hand, sticks closer to the earth - and, as a result, it’s the sort of place where you can eat on a weeknight and have no regrets.
Beebe’s is a restaurant in the bottom of a small hotel in Long Island City, and, while it technically isn’t anything new or groundbreaking, it’s pretty adept at keeping you happy. Most things cost less than $20, the space looks like an Ikea showroom, and the soundtrack consists of some perfectly enjoyable songs that you could pump into an airport lounge or a parent-teacher conference. Think “Heart of Gold” by Neil Young, or anything ever written and performed by the Electric Light Orchestra.The menu is equally crowd-pleasing, with things like pasta, a kale salad, and a few mains like steak and a chicken milanese. None of this food is going to make you want to start worshipping a deity made from your leftovers - but they’re all pretty solid, and the pizzas are great. They’re thin and crispy, and they come with toppings like hot honey, stracciatella, and other things that reach their full potential when placed on flat dough.
If it’s nice out, have a pizza on the back patio. There are plenty of tables, and, with all the planters and umbrellas, it feels kind of like the common area of a condo where everyone works in tech, owns a dog, and goes to bed at 9pm. And the best part is: it never gets too crowded. 
You could get a table here tonight - and, if you live nearby and need something easy, you should. Beebe’s isn’t anything revolutionary, and it isn’t going to make you feel like you just witnessed the birth of a space program that will one day inspire such films as Apollo 13, Aliens, and Muppets from Space -  but it’s safe and reliable, and sometimes that’s all you need."

",2.0,American,Lowerline,8.0,"If an alien visited Lowerline, a New Orleans-inspired spot in Prospect Heights, they would go back to their mothership with the impression that running a great restaurant on planet earth is easy. And that the word “po-boy” is standard vocabulary for what they know as “food between bread.” The aliens have no idea how uncommon a restaurant like Lowerline is. But we do. 
At some casual restaurants, we have to tell the responsible voice in our head to stop bugging us about how we should have just made pasta with butter at home. (His name is Trevor and he’s kind of an asshole.) But at Lowerline, Trevor can relax. The food is excellent, and the dining experience at this neighborhood place is unique.To be clear, there is no food at Lowerline that we could ever make ourselves. (Despite wishing we could casually say “we’re gonna go home and whip up some crawfish étouffée."") There aren’t many other places in NYC where you can find New Orleans-style food this good. There’s a slow kick of spiciness, tons of fresh seafood, and crunchy po-boy bread. If you’re familiar with Louisiana cooking, you’ll be excited. If you’re not, you’ll want to book flights immediately. Especially after they bring out a shot glass of complementary panna cotta at the end of your meal. They make it with Cafe Du Monde coffee, and it’s one of the better things to come in a shot glass since Prohibition.Between the bar and the few tables, there are roughly 12 seats in this place - and that forces a level of closeness between everyone in the restaurant. Not in a middle-seat-on-an-airplane kind of way, but in a way that feels like Lowerline is a small-town joint in a classic movie scene with “Midnight Train To Georgia” playing in the background. If you sit at the bar, you’ll be within creepy-whisper-distance of the friendly owner (who’s from Louisiana, and will probably be shucking oysters). Post up here with a book or bring a date - but we wouldn’t suggest coming to Lowerline with more than one other person. There’s just not enough room. 
As much as we think everyone should be able to experience Lowerline, it wouldn’t be as special if it were a bigger restaurant. The size keeps things quiet and calm, and the Cafe Du Monde panna cotta fully stocked. Lowerline is simply a tiny room full of humans, doing human things like hanging out and eating really good food. The aliens could learn a lot here."

",4.0,French,La Mercerie,8.0,"La Mercerie is a pleasant place. It’s a beautiful all-day cafe housed in a furniture store by Roman and Williams, the famous design firm known for their work in restaurants, hotels, and nightclubs that you have most likely spent some time in: Upland, Freehand, The Ace, The Breslin, the Boom Boom Room, and Le Coucou to name just a few. By the way, you’re not still spending time in the Boom Boom Room, are you? You’re too old to be hanging out there. No matter how old you are.
Luckily, at no point in life will you be too old for a meal that starts with croissants and ends with profiteroles, especially if everything in between consists of various ways to consume soft boiled eggs and aged Comté cheese. La Mercerie is a place where you come to eat French food done well - like your favorite bistro in Paris, but with less smoking. You can decide if that’s for better or worse.That said, your overall opinion of La Mercerie will likely depend less on how you feel about cigarettes and more about something else - how you feel about being around things you can’t have.
Do you like to window shop on Madison Avenue even though you’re also still hanging onto a sandwich from Monday in your refrigerator? Are you happily married but also still secretly keeping screenshots of Armie Hammer in your camera roll? La Mercerie is a place you’ll probably enjoy.
But if you’re the kind of person that would prefer to avoid coming face to face with the fact that you will never own a $25,000 couch, you might have different feelings. Because one of those is for sale just a few hundred feet from where you’re eating, as are the plates and glasses and table that you’re eating from, along with a wood and leather footstool that you should not ever put your feet on. And if you’re the type that prefers to sit across from your dining companion in a chair, know that you might not be able to have one of those either. Some of the two-person seating in this restaurant is situated side-by-side, in a velvet booth. Not ideal if you’re trying to play it cool with a client or person who is not familiar, so make sure you specify before you make a reservation.
In our opinion, the things that you can have at La Mercerie far outweigh the things that you can’t. And that’s why we’ve spent plenty a business meeting dining shoulder to shoulder, trying to decide the most professional way to eat croissant flakes off our pants. I guess that means we’re also the kind of people who can accept the fact that there are some things we’ll never have. Those flakes weren’t meant for us."

",2.0,Pizza,Bocce Union Square,7.4,"In the early aughts, there was a television show hosted by Xzibit called Pimp My Ride. We don’t currently have time to explain who Xzibit is, but the show itself always involved a very average car getting a big makeover. A van might wind up with a hot tub, for example, or an old TransAm might get a new paint job, a chandelier, and an incredibly impractical espresso machine.
Bocce Union Square isn’t a car, but it reminds us of this concept. This restaurant is, essentially, a nice sedan tricked out like a sports car. The Italian food here is perfectly good, but what really makes this spot worthwhile is the fact that it’s in an open-air space at the top of Union Square Park. It’s seasonal, which means you won’t be able to come here once people start putting scarves on mannequins in store windows - but if you hang out in the area, it’s currently one of your best options for some quality time outdoors.
The overall environment at Bocce feels sort of like an Italian piazza as envisioned by a South Beach millionaire who spent a week in Rome. The main structure (Union Square’s Pavilion building) has columns and a tiled roof, and there’s a big patio out front where you can sit and count the number of people who walk into the Barnes & Noble across the street. As promised by the name, this place also has bocce - but there’s only one court, and it’s small and kind of sad. So skip that, and get dinner or drinks instead.The menu isn’t so exciting that you’ll hyperventilate into a paper bag, but it should make everyone happy. We like the thin-crust pizzas that come with toppings like thick pepperoni and pickled chilis, and the smaller plates like the snap pea caesar and fluke crudo are better than what you’d expect from a high-volume place in a touristy area. There are also a few pastas, although perfectly-decent pasta is somehow less satisfying than perfectly-decent pizza - so stick to the pizza.
As long as you don’t mind a crowd, this is also a nice place to just get cocktails with some friends or coworkers. The bartenders might ignore you for a few minutes, and the frozen negroni might taste a little too sweet - but the fact that you’re outdoors should help you forget about those things. This is the Pimp My Ride effect, and it’s what makes this otherwise pretty normal restaurant worth your time."

",2.0,Italian,Coco Pazzo,6.8,"Lots of big ’90s things aren’t around anymore: beepers, Ask Jeeves, synchronized dancing to The Macarena. The original version of Coco Pazzo, on the Upper East Side, also reached peak popularity in the ’90s and then closed a decade ago. Unlike many other hits from that era, this spot is back - now serving casual lunch and more upscale dinner in Soho. But in the current world of NYC Italian restaurants, there’s nothing that makes the new Coco Pazzo worth going out of your way to experience again.
The food here - ranging from salads and seafood appetizers to pastas and shareable entrees - is all fine. The most interesting dishes are in the piatto unico (one dish meal) section of the menu. As the name suggests, these consist of different things on a single plate: there’s a pasta element, like linguini with clam ragu, plus a portion of meat or seafood, like baked clams. The pastas are better than their accompanying sides across the board, but at least this setup allows you to taste various parts of the menu without spending a lot of money (all of them are around $20). Share a couple of these entrees, plus the four-cheese baked rigatoni, and you’ll have an enjoyable meal here. But know that whatever you order, you’ll think back on your dinner less like Seinfeld , and more like those multicolored iMacs - you enjoyed them in the moment, but you probably haven’t missed them too much since.Like the food here, the space and service at Coco Pazzo won’t make anyone mad. Some things are carved tableside, there’s jazz playing at a low volume, and four different servers will check on you every couple of minutes. It’s a decent option for the times when you care more about a restaurant being inoffensive than having incredible food - like a dinner with your in-laws, or lunch with an old coworker who might be able to help you get a job. Sure, it’s not that memorable, but it still comes in handy. Unlike that beeper you haven't turned on since 2001."

",2.0,Pizza,Una Pizza Napoletana,8.1,"Comeback tours always feel exciting. Whether it’s the Spice Girls performing at the Olympics Opening Ceremonies almost two decades after their peak or Fleetwood Mac reuniting for the 18th time, these shows are a chance to relive the past, or to see what you might have missed the first time around. Of course, tickets might be expensive, and there’s the worry that they’ll play too much new stuff, but hey, it’s Stevie Nicks.
After nine years in San Francisco, Una Pizza Napoletana is back in NYC, and in many ways, it’s a classic comeback tour. They’re playing the greatest hits, there’s a hot opening act, and tickets are not cheap.
For some background, Una Pizza Napoletana was for years a beloved Neapolitan spot in the East Village, known for its super simple pies, each made painstakingly by one guy. In 2009, the restaurant left NYC for San Francisco, where it also became very popular, before finally returning to NYC in 2018 and settling into the Lower East Side. The restaurant in its current iteration is co-run with the people behind nearby Wildair and Contra, and they’re responsible for the small plates and desserts, as well as the wine.The pizza part of the menu is very short, and the options are basically all permutations of mozzarella and tomato - there’s a margherita, a marinara, a white pie, and one with egg and salami that’s only available on Saturdays. The crust is light and chewy, and gooey in the middle in a good way. It’s true Neapolitan pizza that absolutely should be eaten with a knife and fork, starting from the middle. Contradicting the fact that food always tastes better when eaten with your hands, cutting into the center here rather than picking it up really does make it taste better.
How completely into this pizza you’ll be is going to depend somewhat on your personal taste - if you like classic, extremely simple Neapolitan pies, you’ll really like what they do here. Those first few bites into the center in particular produced that “oh, this is good, I need to have a moment with this pizza” face that great pies have. And they’d better, because these pizzas cost $25 each, which, simply put, is a lot for a margherita pizza.Beyond pizza, this comeback tour has picked up a pretty cool opening act with appetizers and desserts from the Wildair team, and they’re a big part of a meal here, though they feel somewhat randomly paired with the pizza. If you’re going to get one starter, make sure it’s the beef crudo with cheese, pistachio, and olives, which is like a pleasurable punch in the face. Others, like a lobster crudo or white asparagus dish, are very tasty, but they also feel a little delicate (they’re very small) as a precursor to the pizza. It would be sort of like having Bob Dylan open for Van Halen. Cool idea, even if the energy feels a little off. If you’re budgeting costs or stomach space, we’d instead suggest you put your resources towards dessert, because the options on that front are all fantastic. The ice cream, as well as the tiramisu and panna cotta, are unique takes that we can comfortably say are the best thing here.
Una Pizza Napoletana is a restaurant with a lot of great (though pricey) component parts - the small plates, pizzas, and desserts are all really good. And the space is pretty neutral, like it could be a nice art museum cafe. So think of it this way: a strong comeback tour show, in a nice but unremarkable venue, with a slightly mismatched but also very good opener who killed it on that last song."

",2.0,Pizza,Santa Panza,7.9,"Imagine if all of the signs in this city were more like messages on motivational posters. MTA delay announcement tickers would say, “I’m not telling you it’s going to be easy, I’m telling you it’s going to be worth it.” The billboards in Times Square would read “Mistakes are the greatest teachers.” And Santa Panza would have a poster in the window with “It’s not what you do, it’s how you do it” in big letters. On paper, this is just another casual neighborhood pizza place - but the experience here makes you feel like it’s your casual neighborhood pizza place.
Santa Panza is a cash-only spot in the part of Bushwick that’s almost Bed-Stuy and definitely not East Williamsburg. As soon as you walk in, you feel like you’re part of what’s happening here. The dining room is an open space that snakes around the bar, pizza oven, and kitchen, and the bartender greets every person who comes into the restaurant like they’ve been there hundreds of times. Eating here is a little like experiencing a play about Bushwick, with tourists from the hotel across the street instead of actors.Unlike so many great pizza places in New York, it actually feels like Santa Panza wants you to be there. On the weekends, it’ll look like there’s a wait, but then the host will create seats in bar crevices that didn’t exist before. You can show up with a group of six before a night out and have two more people arrive halfway through the meal, and Santa Panza will make it work. You might as well hire a Special Ops veteran to even get near certain pies in this city, but you don’t need a strategy to get into Santa Panza. This is pizza, not Shakespeare In The Park. 
The same goes for your ordering strategy: you don’t need one. Get a cheese plate and some $30 carafes of wine and turn the place into your group’s personal living room, or go for the pappardelle that tastes like how we imagine it feels to hug a koala. Or come here just for the clams with garlicky white wine broth. We would.But in all likelihood, you’re here for the wood-fired Neapolitan pizzas. Santa Panza serves them in two sizes, 6-inch and 12-inch, with simple combinations of toppings - and they taste a lot like the pizza you’ve had at other very good neighborhood spots. But with so many places in this city trying to reinvent the pizza wheel by frying it into a ball or telling you to cut it with scissors or putting a full diner breakfast on top of it, we really appreciate this pizza's simplicity. 
Go to Santa Panza, then wait three months. You won’t remember exactly what pizzas you ordered, or how exactly they tasted. But you’ll remember who was there, how much fun you had during dinner, and the bartender giving you homemade limoncello. That’s what Santa Panza is doing right."

",2.0,Japanese,Davelle,8.4,"There are a few things we wish New York had more of. Clean subways, 80 degree weather without 100% humidity, and beaches that don’t look like the establishing shot of an E! True Hollywood Story. We also wish there were more new restaurants that genuinely surprised us. Not by flambeeing dishes tableside or by sabering bottles of vintage champagne, but with subtlety. Places where you notice new, unexpected things each time you visit. Basically, we wish we had more places like Davelle.
Davelle is an all-day Japanese restaurant that’s about the size of a studio apartment you’d find in this part of the Lower East Side. There are three small tables and eight seats at a bar, which shifts from serving coffee to wine and sake as the day goes on. Like the one-room space, the food seems fairly straightforward at first glance. But sit down here for dinner, and you’ll find that every dish is packed with intense, unusual flavors that make you think through your food vocabulary like those kids on stage at the national spelling bee.It’s hard to believe that one or two people cooking in such a small space produce such a varied menu, ranging from small plates like tender, lemony fried chicken to entrees like rich, smoky pork curry to a number of Japanese spaghetti dishes unlike anything else you’ll find in New York. One is cooked in ketchup and soy sauce (a combo that’s popular in Japan and works impressively well), and another is topped with so much uni that eating it feels like when a wave knocks you down and rolls you along the ocean floor, but without the whole losing your bathing suit thing. And these dishes only make up half the menu.
Davelle also specializes in oden, comprised of small bowls of dashi broth with your choice of ingredients like daikon or fried octopus. They’re all about $4 and are a nice, light complement or alternative to the intensely-flavored entrees. The broth is held in what looks like an espresso machine on the bar, and it constantly changes as it simmers and new ingredients are added. So not only is the food here different from just about every other spot around, but order the same oden here two days in a row, and the flavors will be different each time.We’d understand if such a small spot making this quality and variety of food treated everything else as an afterthought, but the surprises here go beyond the food. The wine list, for example, only has about 10 options, but all of them are natural wines under $60, including a couple pet-nats (lightly sparkling, cloudy-looking wines that are often pretty funky). To devote a quarter of an already tiny wine list to a polarizing style that lots of people have never heard of is just one of the unexpected details that make this place special and different.
The acoustics are a mix of Marvin Gaye, Ray Charles, and stories from the chef/owner about growing up in Hokkaido. With the old mirror over the fireplace and the dried flowers hanging on the brick walls, Davelle feels more like the den in a brownstone than a new restaurant on the LES. We’re surprised. Now we just need to figure out the subways and beaches. And weather."

",3.0,Mediterranean,Celestine,7.6,"Eat in enough neighborhood restaurants, and they can start to blend together. You remember you had roast chicken, but was it at the place with a chalkboard menu and natural wines, or at the dimly-lit spot with an open kitchen playing The Smiths? Both, probably. But there’s only one neighborhood place that feels like it was picked up from a quiet side-street and transported to a prime waterfront location in Dumbo. That place is Celestine.
Celestine is a Mediterranean restaurant with panoramic views of the city, the Manhattan Bridge, and all the wedding parties in Brooklyn Bridge Park. The dining room has floor-to-ceiling windows that slide open, and the tables on the outdoor patio get that unmistakable aroma of sea air infused with a hint of pollution.This is certainly not the only waterfront restaurant in Dumbo that’s made for holiday cards and new profile pictures. But most of those other Dumbo places are club-restaurants that got lost on their way to Miami, and Celestine feels much more like a neighborhood hang. Logs for the wood-fired oven are stacked in the middle of the dining room, and instead of indistinguishable club beats and servers trying to upsell you on an overpriced bottle of California merlot, Celestine plays Sly & The Family Stone and has casual servers who walk you through their various orange wines from Slovenia.If the food at Celestine - a rotating menu of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern dishes - were as enjoyable as the setting, then this would be one of those check-off-all-the-boxes spots that we’d recommend to everyone. But overall, it’s hit-or-miss. Some dishes, like the very rich morel risotto topped with a poached egg, are good. Others, like the flatbread with so much za’atar that it tastes like it’s been dipped in a mixture of Maldon salt and old weed, are not. 
At any other casual neighborhood place, those misses might leave you wishing you were somewhere else. But at Celestine, the thought won’t cross your mind. You’re eating a casual dinner on the river, and you didn’t have to wear a tie or propose to someone or make a reservation two months ago to be here. Of course there’s roast chicken on the menu, but you definitely won’t confuse this place for that spot next to the 24-hour laundromat."

",3.0,American,Legacy Records,8.4,"When you were young and you knew your multiplication tables, people clapped for you. But now that you have a bank account and fewer favorite dinosaurs, people just expect you to be impressive on a daily basis. Such is life as an adult - and, if Legacy Records were a person, it would probably relate.
Legacy Records is the latest place from the people behind Charlie Bird and Pasquale Jones, two of our favorite restaurants in the city. Unlike those downtown spots, however, this place is in a fancy new condo building in Hudson Yards, a neighborhood that’s about one RoboCop away from feeling dystopian. The restaurant itself is huge and expensive-looking, and, much like a fully-grown person with a job and a phone bill, it inspires certain expectations. As long as you’re willing to spend some money, however, Legacy Records will easily meet them.
The menu here is similar to what you’ll find at Charlie Bird and other places that want to be like Charlie Bird, which is to say: pasta, crudo, duck, and steak. If that sounds boring, that’s because it usually is - but when the formula is this well-executed, it’s hard to complain. The roasted duck is one of the best dishes made from that bird in the city, the pastas are more complex than what you’ll find at most Italian restaurants, and the crudo sampler will make you feel like you’re at a dinner party hosted by Poseidon. It comes with five different types of raw seafood like scallop and tuna belly, and it’s one of the better ways to spend $25 on yourself.As for the space, it’s opulent. The floors are a mix of tile and hardwood, there’s a horseshoe bar that looks like it belongs on a 100-foot yacht, and the tables are all topped with leather - which, apparently, is something that you can do with tables. The ceilings are also so high it’ll make you want to Google the cost of vertical real estate, and the green-and-gold color scheme has a vaguely country-club-designed-by-Wes-Anderson feel to it. Despite all of this, however, Legacy Records isn’t quiet or stuffy. 
The service is friendly, the old-school hip hop soundtrack is louder than you expect from a place where you can buy a magnum of vintage Krug, and the host won’t check to see what kind of shoes you’re wearing. And, in that sense, this place has retained a lot of the DNA of its downtown predecessors. The only real difference is: it isn’t as small or charming, and all the little extras like the excellent wine list feel less surprising. Essentially, Legacy Records is the grown-up version of a cool downtown restaurant - but, fortunately, it’s still capable of surpassing expectations."

",2.0,American,City Vineyard,7.5,"Picture a Venn Diagram. No, really, do it. We’ll wait. One circle represents all the places to drink good wine in New York City. It’s a big-ass circle, full of natural wine bars, white tablecloth restaurants, and your apartment when someone brings over a bottle that costs more than $12. The other circle has all the places to drink outside in the summer, filled with rooftops, boats, beer gardens, and patios. As for the middle part of this diagram, where good wine and good outdoor space overlap - it’s pretty tiny. But at least there’s City Vineyard. 
City Vineyard is a two-floor restaurant and wine bar on the Hudson River in Tribeca. You could technically have dinner in the indoor dining room, but we’d suggest you skip that in favor of the massive roof deck. Both it and the ground-floor wine garden are big enough to fit everyone in your office Slack channel on Summer Fridays, and it’s walking distance from FiDi, Soho, Tribeca, and the West Village. More importantly, it has panoramic views of downtown Manhattan and the river. 
Those views are great, but the wine is what really separates City Vineyard from every other giant outdoor bar that serves $18 glasses of sparkling rosé and cocktails that look like they glow in the dark. The 30-page wine list at City Vineyard would be worth a trip even without the ’80s hip-hop on the speakers and the sunsets over the water.This place is an offshoot of City Winery, a bar nearby that makes its own wines, many of which are served on tap at City Vineyard. Since they don’t have to spend money bottling or labeling, and the wines last months rather than hours, you can get fresh, consistent riesling and pinot noir on tap here at relatively affordable prices. The rest of the huge wine list has famous and unusual options from all over the world - but City Vineyard doesn’t take itself too seriously. Nobody here will roll their eyes if you ask for some seltzer and turn your Sancerre into a spritz.
You’ll be happy enough with some seafood share plates like baked clams and calamari on your table, and maybe after that fourth flight of house wines, get the burger with gruyere. If you’ve never chased oysters with Muscadet, City Vineyard would also be a good place to change that.
Can you get better bar food at other places around the city? Absolutely. But you don’t come here for the food. You come to City Vineyard because you want to have good wine outside, and you don’t want to drink Barolo out of solo cups in the park or nearly frozen Pinot Grigio on crowded hotel rooftops. You want a spot right in the middle of that Venn Diagram. Your middle school math teacher would be proud."

",3.0,American,Barbuto,8.0,"The West Village is full of places that are always going to be packed. Some of them will be packed because they were featured on a TV show 20 years ago, or because tourists like cupcakes. Others will be packed because they show sports on TV or offer bottomless brunch or have tables where you can play shuffleboard or ping pong while listening to live jazz in a basement, which is a thing people apparently like to do.
But many of the best places in the West Village will be packed because they serve good wine and pasta in exceptionally pleasant spaces on cobblestone streets. Places like Barbuto. 
Barbuto has become a West Village institution. Open for years, it’s still hard to get a reservation or walk in without a wait. They’ve threatened to close multiple times, but we have a hard time seeing that happen any time soon. Even if they just reheated frozen pizza and put it on their menu, people would still come here for one of the best restaurant spaces in the neighborhood.If we had to venture a guess, we’d say that for as long as this place is open, it’s going to keep serving roast chicken and kale salad - the two dishes Barbuto is best known for. The menu is seasonal, kind-of-Italian, kind-of-American, and almost everyone you bring here is going to be very happy with it. 
We will say that if you’ve eaten here many times over the years, or if you eat in a lot of seasonal Italian restaurants, you might not be as excited about Barbuto as you were a few years back. Maybe that’s because Barbuto’s roast chicken and pasta isn’t quite good as it used to be, or maybe it’s because other restaurants keep getting better at making roast chicken and pasta - although it’s probably a bit of both. The food here is still good, even if it’s just not quite in that class of NYC’s greatest Italian restaurants.
That said, unless you’re setting out to eat something you’ve never tried before, or to eat the best Italian food in the city, you’re not going to be disappointed. Barbuto is still one of the first places we think of when the weather gets good and we want to pretend like we’re on vacation. The big, industrial corner space has garage doors for walls, and when they open them, the whole place feels like it’s outside. When you’re sitting here, drinking wine, eating pasta, and enjoying a noticeably clean-smelling breeze, you won’t want to be anywhere else in the West Village. Even if you really do enjoy listening to live jazz while playing ping pong."

",2.0,Burgers,BK Jani,8.6,"Most of the things you get over a counter are disappointing. The shoes you rent at a bowling alley, for example, always make you seem less cool. And the antibiotics you pick up at a pharmacy after a bird attacks you in the park are inevitably too big to swallow. Even the salads you buy at lunch taste like they were made in an alternate universe where lettuce is always a little bit old and optimism isn’t a thing. But BK Jani is different. 
This is a tiny counter-service spot in Bushwick, and they serve Pakistani street food that’s some of the finest stuff you’ll ever order from a person with an iPad. It’s better and more affordable than what you’ll find at most full-service restaurants, and, after you eat here, you’ll stare out your bedroom window and wait for a shooting star, just so you can wish for more of this food.
The first thing you should order here is the signature Jani burger. It has a thick patty and some spicy mint chutney, and eating it for the first time feels sort of like hearing your favorite song on the radio after having been lost in the woods for several years. It’s simple and near-perfect, and the seekh kababs might be even better. They’re well-spiced and grilled, and you can get them on a piece of flaky paratha with yogurt and chutney. The little hand-held lamb chops should also be on your table - and if that sounds like too much, just bring a few friends, or put up an ad for eating buddies on Craigslist.Just be aware that the dining room here is roughly the size of a subway car, the little picnic tables are occasionally sticky, and everything comes on paper plates. There also isn’t any alcohol of any kind, and, if you’re still reading this, congratulations. You’ve passed the test, and you deserve this food.
Come on a weeknight when you want something quick. Or, if you don’t live in the neighborhood, make plans to stop by on a weekend afternoon. There aren’t many counter-service places worth traveling for, but BK Jani is one of them."

",2.0,Bar Food,The Spaniard,6.8,"Going out on a boat for the day is great, but taking a 10-day cruise is far less enjoyable. In both situations, you’re out on the open ocean getting sunshine and not catching fish. But one gets you back to shore before you run out of limes for your beers, while the other leaves you with a shot glass from St. Lucia, a desire never to eat shrimp cocktail again, and the lingering thought that maybe you should have spent your money elsewhere. The experience is more fun when it’s casual and low-commitment, and we feel the same way about The Spaniard.
The Spaniard is a bar on a busy stretch in the West Village with an extensive cocktail menu and over 100 types of whiskey. There are a couple TVs that show major sporting events, but this place is much more of a cocktail bar like The Happiest Hour than wherever you watch the first half of Knicks games. While the food is probably better than it is at that sports bar, it’s also considerably more expensive. Overall, you’ll have a better time if you use The Spaniard as a bar rather than a restaurant. 
We’re clearly not alone in liking The Spaniard for day drinking and for after-dinner cocktails with a group. The whole space - a big horseshoe bar with booths along the walls and a separate dining room - tends to be packed every night and all day on weekends. A lot of West Village bars get crowded, but they’re usually dark, small spaces where you lose your voice trying to yell over deadmau5 blasting from the speakers. The Spaniard, though, is a multi-room space that never gets too loud or dark, where you can comfortably speak with friends or even try to move beyond your “no new friends” policy. 
But the crowds that make this a fun spot to get drinks also make eating a full meal here a fairly unpleasant experience. The tables always seem to have reserved signs, even though some remain empty for hours, and if you sit at the bar, you’ll have crowds three-deep shouting “whiskey ginger” over your head throughout your meal.The Spaniard serves elevated bar food, like buffalo wings with duck, a ribeye with housemade steak sauce, and lobster toast - and it’s just alright overall. In most cases, the twists don’t actually make the dishes taste better - in the case of the wings, for example, any duck flavor is lost under the grainy, mild buffalo sauce. While some things are pretty good - like the patty melt - the prices all feel a few dollars too expensive, and $25 is more than we’re looking to spend on a patty melt and fries.
Dinner at The Spaniard is generally disappointing, but perhaps that’s due to unrealistic expectations. We had (and continue to have) good times drinking at the bar, and we got ahead of ourselves thinking the food could be great as well. It’s yet another reminder that just because something is enjoyable in small doses, it doesn’t mean that more of it will be pleasant as well. Ten days chugging Pepto on a floating amusement park should have taught us that."

That may sound more stressful than getting through airport security when you’re late to your flight, but once you sit down, Sushi By Bou actually feels like breezing through with TSA Precheck. The whole meal is paced so that as soon as you finish one piece, you’re handed the next. It doesn’t feel rushed - just efficient. And the omakase itself is great, with a range of fish and preparations. We like the West 20th location of Bou, located speakeasy-style in a bar above a restaurant called Jue Lan Club, but there’s another location in Midtown as well. All you have to do to make a reservation at either location is text them day-of. In the summer months, they also have a highly pleasant outdoor sushi bar popup."

",3.0,Italian,Bamonte’s,7.7,"New York is full of institutions: we have museums, hotels, and even department stores that have stood the test of time, and are now name brands known around the world. Bamonte’s, an Italian restaurant in Williamsburg that opened in 1900, might not be a globally-recognized icon, but it’s still an essential New York institution. If John D. Rockefeller has an oyster dish named after him, so should Pasquale Bamonte.
This red-sauce Italian spot has been in the same space in Williamsburg since the beginning of the last century. The dining room hasn’t been updated since the ’50s, and the space is still filled with tuxedo-wearing servers who bring family-style plates of baked ziti and pork chop parmesan to big tables of people. If you haven’t been part of one of those big tables of people, it’s time you made it into this classic establishment.
The fact that this place hasn’t changed at all - despite Williamsburg’s transformation around it - makes eating here that much more special. The space still has old phone booths, the walls are covered in pictures of the pope and signed portraits of celebrities, and the house bread comes with foil-wrapped butter packets. When your server opens the wine and fills your glass to the brim, you may have flashbacks to your first visit to the city - when you went into a spot in Little Italy with a street sign out front that said “Best Italian Food in New York”, and you ended up spending two hours eating mediocre cannolis and listening to the owner’s daughter sing ""These Boots Are Made For Walkin'"". But Bamonte’s isn’t sticking to its traditions as a gimmick. It’s just doing what it’s always done: be a welcoming place to share food covered mostly in cheese and tomato sauce with a group of people.Besides the items that the old-school servers with bowties tell you they have “special for you tonight,” the long menu is a laundry list of Italian-American classics. Everything is served family style, and unless you’re carbo-loading for the Brooklyn Half, you’ll probably go home with leftovers. Definitely start with the cheese ravioli, which are massive housemade pockets of al dente pasta that ooze cheese as soon as you pierce them with your fork. For entrees, get the very big, very breaded, and very cheesy pork chop parmesan, and probably a bunch more pastas. When’s the last time you had a plate of baked ziti? It’s time to change that, at Bamonte’s.
Sure, you can find better Italian food - Lilia is around the corner - but you’re not at Bamonte’s to experience the food. If you let some under-seasoned pastas or over-sauced entrees ruin your night, you’re missing the point. You’re here to experience the place and the history. Nobody seems to have created Oysters Bamonte yet, but that deserves to change."

We tend to believe there are VIP tables we’ll never be given and secret reservation phone lines we don’t know about, or that our neighbors must be slipping the super 20s to look the other way about the fact that they let their dog pee on the roof. New Yorkers enjoy a minor conspiracy theory, sometimes just for sport. To that end, people occasionally ask us if The Infatuation keeps some unpublished list of hidden gems. There must be, people seem to believe, some little black book of perfect neighborhood wine bars or speakeasy pasta places that we keep to ourselves.
There is no such clandestine list. Because unlike the pet owners from the second floor, we’re 100% honest. We go somewhere, we tell you about it. Whether it’s good or bad.
But if such a secret document ever did exist, Le French Diner would be on it.Le French Diner is a small bistro on the Lower East Side, and from the moment we discovered it, we simultaneously wanted to tell everyone about it and to also keep it to ourselves. In all respects, Le French Diner is a hidden gem. From the outside, it looks like it would be a random place that makes crepes or something, and on the inside, the setup is simple: three tables, about 10 bar seats, and two people behind those bar seats cooking in a kitchen only slightly bigger than the one in your apartment.
And they really do make some magic happen in that tiny kitchen. It’s not the kind of magic that happens with foams and obscure ingredients, but rather the sorcery of a perfect hanger steak topped with tiny crumbles of blue cheese or a crispy octopus with the most flavorful aioli you’ve ever had. The short menu is full of bistro classics: there are escargots, duck rillettes, scallops, mussels, and maybe a grilled rabbit if it’s the right season. Visit after visit, each plate of food here is both exactly what you expect and better than you expect. Does that make any sense? Hang out at Le French Diner and you too will start thinking like a French philosopher.In the background, French hip hop may be playing, and wine will definitely be flowing. Speaking of wine, bottles are listed on a chalkboard simply as “Bordeaux” or “Chablis,” but tend to be all good picks from small French producers. To sum up all of the above, you’re going to leave here depressed this place isn’t in your neighborhood, and you’ll be torn between bringing every person who’s ever wished you a happy birthday on Facebook here, and keeping it completely to yourself.
Remember that secret hotline? By knowing about Le French Diner, you have access. All (three) of the tables here are for VIPs. And yes, your neighbor is definitely paying off the super."

With bright colors and murals all over the place, and food suited to sharing, this place is a solid option for a lively group dinner, especially one where having a good time is more essential than being wowed by what you’re eating.
The space, in, particular, helps make this place fun: the big room is decorated with portraits of animals dressed like businessmen, multi-colored place settings, and floor-to-ceiling pop art. There are two separate bar areas - one where they make colorful cocktails, and a bread bar with a few counter seats overlooking a big wood-burning oven painted like a tiger. You could sit there with one or two friends, but most of the tables here are filled with big groups, which keeps this place about as loud as the ball pit at a McDonald’s PlayPlace.The food at Bombay Bread Bar is also good for groups, as all the dishes, ranging from small starters to large format plates like pork vindaloo, are served family style. We generally recommend leaning heavily on the breads (there are 10 different kinds) and the small plates, like the bhelpuri with mangoes and peanuts or the upma polenta, which tastes like cheesy grits topped with smoky mushrooms. These small plates are a better bet than the mains, which tend to be unmemorable, and end up serving primarily as vehicles for bread-dipping more than anything else.
This place is also sneaky expensive, and if you get three dishes per person as they recommend, you’ll probably end up spending more than typical for casual group dinners. But you’ve overlooked worse in the interest of having a fun time with friends. And at least this room has bathrooms and alcohol."

",3.0,American,Simon & The Whale,8.3,"At the Oscars, it isn’t always the best movie that wins. Generally, the film that takes home the naked golden statue of a man holding a sword is the one that everyone can more-or-less agree on. Like Forrest Gump, The Departed, or that movie about the janitor with a super-high security clearance who catches feelings for a fish deity. These are objectively well-made films with wide appeal, and if Simon & The Whale were a movie, it’d be one of them.
Simon & The Whale is from the same people behind Fedora, Joseph Leonard, and Bar Sardine - and if all of those little West Village spots are indie films, this one’s more of a blockbuster. It’s in the bottom of the Freehand Hotel (on the border of Kips Bay and Gramercy), and it’s a well-designed space where you can eat some very good food while you celebrate something, even if it’s just the fact that it’s a Friday and you aren’t currently doing whatever it is you get paid to do.
Take a look at the menu and squint, and it’ll mostly seem Mediterranean. But once your food arrives, you’ll find that it’s more interesting than about 99% of the stuff at other restaurants that also serve bass crudo and broccoli rabe. The crudo comes covered in coconut milk, for example, and this is probably the only place in the city where you can get a roasted chunk of cauliflower covered in lamb tongue pastrami. It’s great, and you should order it - and you should also know that even the straightforward things like arctic char tartare are worth your time.Everyone’s going to find something to eat here, and the whole experience is as fancy as you make it. The space feels like a large study, with gold light fixtures, tiled walls, and wood-paneled ceilings - and if you want to wear shorts and a t-shirt, that’s fine. Although if you’re in a suit because you just came from work or a bat mitzvah, you won’t feel out-of-place. Service is top-notch, and you can either have a very nice date night here, or stop by for a fish sandwich on a Wednesday night. 
Although if you try to get a seat here last-minute, you’ll probably face a wait. And that’s because this is an all-around exceptional restaurant. Sure, there might not be any one dish that really sticks out and haunts your dreams - but, like pretty much any Best Picture winner, you can count on the fact that it’ll impress most people. Maybe you’ll even fall in love with it, the same way certain people really like  Titanic or (for some reason) American Beauty. And even if you don’t become a die-hard fan of this place, you can be confident that you’ll at least eat something good and have a nice time."

They are gifted some level of fame and opportunity, but they also have to live in a pretty big shadow. Kimbal may do some great things and he probably won’t have any trouble getting his message out to the world, but if he doesn’t set up a colony on Mars or get us to The Hamptons in under three hours on a Friday afternoon, then he’ll always be referred to as Elon’s brother. Similarly, Giuseppina’s is run by the brother of the guy behind Lucali, and while they make good pizza, it doesn’t measure up to the stuff coming out of the oven at that much-more-famous spot.
Giuseppina’s looks a lot like Lucali, from the dark dining room with candlelit tables to the wood-burning oven in the open kitchen, and the pizza is pretty similar as well. There are a few topping options, but all of them are pretty subtle, and the focus is on the thin crust. We like the plain pizza best, which has some very good housemade tomato sauce, mozzarella, and a bunch of fresh basil.
That said, the calzone is chewy and pretty bland, especially compared to the truly special version at Lucali. It’s also expensive, and a cash-only spot charging $36 for a veggie pie better be making some fantastic pizza. While the food here is definitely good, we find ourselves wondering if this place would be noteworthy if there was no Lucali. Like Rickon without Robb, the answer is probably no."

When you’ve been working from home all day and realize that you’ve eaten nothing but Captain Crunch, you’re going to grab two, maybe three slices. When you stop on your way home from a bar, you grab three slices, but usually end up with one and a half after tripping on your way up to your apartment. The very good slices at Williamsburg Pizza, however, are big enough that a single slice usually does the trick.
This paper-plate spot in Williamsburg doesn’t claim to be revolutionizing pizza and they don’t speak at length about where their flour is milled - they just serve some really good pizza. The round pies are solid (especially the ones that go heavy on fresh tomatoes), but you should come here for the buttery, cheesy grandma square pies. Get the one with soppressata and a ton of fresh melted mozzarella or the one with kale, sausage, and taleggio. Or if you want to prove that grabbing a slice is really never an accurate statement, then get both."

Everything about Best Pizza, starting with the name, is simple and great. The one-room space in Williamsburg has a few tables, and a menu above the register lists the five types of slices cooked in the wood-fired oven and served on white paper plates. The grandma square is doughy and cheesy and topped with very good tomatoes - but the best thing here is the white pie with ricotta and pecorino. It has a charred crust sprinkled with sesame seeds, and caramelized onions that taste like spoonfuls of berry jam.
Best Pizza could get more elaborate with certain things, but naming itself Margherita Mama’s and having candlelit tables would not help solve peoples’ need for a high-quality neighborhood slice option. Their pizza does that all on its own."

Neither one is necessarily correct - safety is important, as is the ability to win street races. People also consider different factors when evaluating pizza. If you’re someone who cares more about toppings than crust, then you’ll enjoy the huge variety of pizzas at L’Industrie.
L’Industrie is a tiny, cash-only spot in Williamsburg that serves about 30 different pizzas available by the pie and slice. They range from a breakfast pie with bacon and egg to one with garlic confit, brie, and truffle oil, and we like most of the combinations, especially the ones with cured meats. The problem is that you’ll have to overlook some bland and hollow crust. But with as much horsepower as a small jet engine, maybe backing into a few shopping carts is a sacrifice you’re willing to accept."

You could Wikipedia Mount Vesuvius and go down an Internet rabbit hole that somehow ends at a biography of Rihanna. Or you could read the first nine pages of a classic Irish novel, then take a two-and-a-half hour nap. 
You could also have dinner at Brooklyn Cider House. Most restaurants where a meal lasts this long tend to be white-tablecloth spots where people dress like Mr. Andrews in the dining room on the Titanic. But Brooklyn Cider House is the opposite: a fun place to spend a few hours drinking and eating with a group.Brooklyn Cider House is a bar, brewery, and prix-fixe restaurant in a converted warehouse in Bushwick. The bar’s up front, the industrial dining room is at the back, and in between is where the cider lives - in barrels the size of your mom’s old Grand Caravan. You’ll head to this tasting room after each course in order to “catch” your cider as it streams out of the giant vats. 
If your only experience with cider is Angry Orchard and a severe morning need for Advil and blue Gatorade, know that the cider here doesn’t have any added sugar and is more funky than sweet. This is particularly important considering you can catch as much of it as you want between each of the Basque-inspired food courses.This place has a lot going on, so you might expect the food to be an afterthought. But the four-course prix-fixe dinner here can stand on its own. The dishes are all served family-style, and the highlight is the ribeye. For a charred, juicy bone-in steak like this, we’d expect to pay a slightly uncomfortable amount of money and be happy if they didn’t skimp on the side of roasted potatoes. But at Brooklyn Cider House, you get this, along with three other courses and unlimited cider for $49 (plus tax and tip).
Somewhere around the second round of cider catching, as the cider sommelier talks about how they built a custom shipping container big enough to transport these barrels from Spain, you’ll probably decide that this was a far better use of your time than falling down another Wikipedia rabbit hole. During the fourth tasting, you may decide that you could use a nap. Fortunately, you still have that Irish novel lying around somewhere."

And if you want to drink a lot of wine while a server pretends that you were never born and technically don’t exist, you should move to Paris. Similarly, if you’re a fan of seafood, there’s a very good chance that you’ll develop strong feelings for Abuqir.
This is a little seafood restaurant/market in Astoria with a counter in the back where you point at exactly what you want to eat. The daily selection usually includes a few types of whole fish as well as some smaller things like baby octopus, squid, and a few kinds of shrimp. And, after you pick out all your food, you then specify how you’d like it cooked (baked, fried, grilled, etc.), then just have a seat and wait.
Once everything arrives, it will inevitably be some of the best food you’ve eaten off of plastic plates. The fried shrimp, for example, come perfectly cooked and dusted with spices, and the grilled shrimp are so good that you might become angry. “Why are these even better than the fried ones?,” you might wonder. And when you try the baba ganoush, you will once again become upset. Because it’s that good. Finally, you’ll eat a whole fish, and leave happy.One thing to know, however, is that this place doesn’t really have any ambiance. The lights are bright, the decor consists of a dolphin poster that was probably stolen from a pediatrician’s office in 1985, and the furniture looks like it might have belonged to an Office Depot collection called “Just Furniture.” In other words, it isn’t fancy - and you probably shouldn’t bring a date (unless your date is a merperson, a dolphin, or just a seafood enthusiast in general).
Fortunately, the ambiance doesn’t matter. At least if you love seafood. Because when you get your bill and realize how little you paid for some truly great fish, the world will feel like the best version of itself. Abuqir is a seafood lover’s seafood place, and if you just thought, “Hey, that sounds like me,” you should start planning a trip here immediately."

",3.0,American,Reynard,8.1,"If you asked us our thoughts on Reynard at some point since its opening in 2012, you probably heard something like, “It’s another hotel restaurant.” This likely made you think of business lunches, $21 salads, and fancy silverware. After all, you probably only go to hotel restaurants when you need an inoffensive spot to meet people you don’t really know, or you have cousins staying there who are too tired to go out after a long day searching for knockoff handbags and walking so, so slowly on sidewalks all over the city.
And for several years, Reynard was just another hotel restaurant. Sure, it was in a cool Williamsburg hotel, not the Sheraton Times Square, but it still wasn’t a very exciting place to eat. Particularly when you considered it was in one of the city’s top restaurant neighborhoods. But that’s changed in a major way: they’ve brought in a new chef, changed the menu, and Reynard is now serving some very good food.
The American food at Reynard is mostly all cooked over a wood fire, which helps make everything from steak to roasted cauliflower taste pretty delicious. And thanks to an in-house butcher, there are also some adventurous things to eat, from beef tongue to a pig head terrine. But even the dishes that sound like ordinary hotel restaurant items are much more interesting than you’d expect. The roasted squash and a half-chicken, for example, are some of the best things on the menu. The squash cooks overnight on the embers of the open-hearth, and the big portion of smoky chicken is served with sides of crispy rice and smoked cabbage that will make you wonder if there’s any safe way to cook with an open-fire in your apartment. There is not.The bar area at Reynard is casual and you’ll almost definitely hear “Can’t Stop The Feeling” or, if the bartender is feeling sentimental, “Cry Me A River”, but overall, this is one of the fancier dinner options in the neighborhood. Unlike some Williamsburg servers who sneer if you don’t comment on their rib tattoo of the Allegory of the Cave, the servers at Reynard explain how each dish is made and recommend options from the long French wine list that will pair nicely with your food. With this in mind, besides the Nordic families and middle-aged Parisian couples staying at The Wythe, Reynard tends to be filled with Williamsburg residents who need a place that will convince their parents that they have their lives together, even if they actually have three roommates in a converted one bedroom under the BQE.
In order to get into Reynard, you’ll have to walk past groups of guys waiting for the doorman to let them up to the rooftop bar, and then you’ll have to pass through the tourist-filled lobby. But trust us, the hotel restaurant stereotype at Reynard ends there."

",3.0,Italian,Fausto,8.2,"If you have an older sibling, you probably know what it’s like to be referred to as so-and-so’s younger brother or sister. Maybe everyone called you “Sara’s sister, right?” when you showed up to ninth grade, or maybe you were known as “little Mike” to all the older kids. It was annoying, most likely. 
I personally am a tyrannical older sibling, so I can’t relate to this. But Fausto can.
Fausto, first of all, is located in the space formerly occupied by Franny’s. And second, it’s run by a former owner and chef from L’Artusi. If you’re unfamiliar, Franny’s was a beloved restaurant that made great pizzas, but was best known for being everyone’s favorite place in Park Slope from 2003 until it closed at the end of 2017. It was a quintessential Brooklyn restaurant, and one of the first places in this part of Brooklyn that people from all over the city traveled to. L’Artusi, meanwhile, has a 9.5 rating from us, and is really a place you should go tonight if you haven’t been. So for at least a while, Fausto is likely to be referred to by many as “the new Franny’s” or “the place from the L’Artusi people,” if not both combined.And it does share some things in common with those places, falling somewhere in the middle of the two. It’s more dressed up than Franny’s, which was more of a neighborhood spot, and there are no pizzas, though they still make plenty of use of the wood-burning oven. At the same time, it’s more casual than L’Artusi, but they do have a similarly extensive list of pastas.
But if you can leave its cool older siblings behind, Fausto is best considered on its own. As a very good, modern Italian restaurant. The menu is filled with things you’ll want to eat, like a snapper crudo, meatballs, orechiette with pork, a simple fusilli with tomato sauce, a roast chicken, and a lamb chop. All of it is well-executed, and very enjoyable. Yes, you can eat similar dishes at other high-end, modern Italian places around the city and country, but if there were a loyalty program for tagliatelle ragu and little gem salads, we’d enroll, so no complaints there. Additionally, the service is notably friendly and welcoming, and the wine list and cocktails are excellent.Fausto is a great choice for a night out that falls somewhere between “random Friday date night” and special occasion. Stop by and have a cocktail and a bowl of pasta at the bar to celebrate a small victory, like finishing a big project at work, or finding the Apple TV remote after three months. Or make a reservation when you have some out of town visitors you want to show around Park Slope/Prospect Heights.
Don’t worry so much about what came before."

A universe that’s pretty similar to ours, but a dinosaur ate a butterfly, events were set in motion, and now things aren’t quite the way they should be. Lebron James plays hockey. Father John Misty is in a boy band. Mark Zuckerberg runs a fashion company.
The Ice King is clearly a great athlete, but he’s just a little clumsy on skates. Father John Misty has a good voice, but he can’t nail his choreography. Zuck built an addictive shopping website, but he’s having a hard time disrupting the hoodie and gray t-shirt market from his college dorm room.
Soogil, a Korean restaurant in the East Village, also has a lot of potential, but seems to be stuck in that part of the multiverse where things aren’t exactly as they should be. The creative small plates, serious service, and casual, nondescript setting would all be OK on their own, but they don’t make sense together in the same restaurant.Soogil’s biggest selling point is the food itself. It’s a mix of Korean and French flavors and techniques, and it’s the kind of stuff you’d want to eat on a date when you need to prove to someone that you’re interesting. We especially like the pork belly with shrimp sauce and the foie gras with berry jelly, but our favorite dishes here come from the “garden” section of the menu - like the glass noodles with bulgogi. Topping noodles with a bunch of marinated beef and putting it under the vegetable section of a menu is a practice we wholeheartedly endorse.
In the right universe, these impressive small plates would be served in a louder, darker space by servers who want you to have a great time. But Soogil’s quiet, serious setting is generally what you’d expect from a white-tablecloth restaurant that serves a prix-fixe lunch - not from a small restaurant serving innovative food in the East Village. The music is played way below Shazam-detecting levels, so first dates are probably out of the question unless you want a room full of strangers to hear about growing up in the suburbs. The limited wine options and brightly-lit space make it a strange choice for a fancy night out, but the higher prices and formal service also mean you’re not coming here for a casual dinner. 
Put all these elements together and you have a perfectly good restaurant - but one that’s not really perfect for any situation. You’ll probably like everything you eat at Soogil, but your meal will be in that universe of incompatibility where Father John Misty can’t stay in sync with his backup dancers, and Zuck wants to sell you sh*tty clothes."

",3.0,American,St. Anselm,8.8,"The year was 2011. Williamsburg was cool, its residents were called “hipsters,” other people liked to talk about their mustaches and fixed-gears, and a neighborhood steakhouse called St. Anselm opened with a signature steak that cost $15.
Fast forward to now. That steak is $24, Williamsburg is objectively not cool, and mustaches are just mustaches. But St. Anselm is still one of the greatest places to eat a steak in New York City.
That is, if you can get in. It’s a narrow room with maybe eight tables and a long row of seats overlooking the open kitchen, where you can watch your two-pound ax handle being showered with salt and cooked on an open grill. The room is covered in brick and wood, and makes you feel a little bit like a medieval knight in a cabin upstate. There are no reservations, and if you don’t show up before 7pm - especially on weekends - you will likely end up needing a new dinner plan. 
But St. Anselm is worth the effort of arriving early, explaining to your visitors why you’re waiting two hours for steak and mashed potatoes, and getting drunk while you wait for your table (in the backyard of Spuyten Duyvil next door if it’s summer, or at the wine bar Have & Meyer in the winter).If there are only two of you, or if you want a Hall of Fame solo meal, you should request counter seats. St. Anselm feels different from every other steakhouse in large part because the cooking is all out in the open. You don’t have to be someone who uses your kitchen to want to figure out how these people make your steak taste this good.
We suspect it has a lot to do with butter and salt. We’re not totally sure what they do it, but we are sure that you should be ordering the butchers steak, every time. Have they raised the price every year? Yes. Is it still the best steak at St. Anselm? Yes. Even over the more expensive ones? 100%. Feel free to add on other meats, and the mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach and pretty much any other side that appeals, and the chocolate pot de creme for dessert. But the butchers steak is the thing we come back for.
But really, we come back to St. Anselm because there’s no other restaurant like it. In a city where you can find a duplicate, or at least a really good substitute, for just about every spot, there isn’t one for St. Anselm. This place hasn’t just aged better than “Party Rock Anthem,” “The Hangover II,” and most other things that came around in 2011 - it’s a real classic."

You’re deep in anticipation, taking stock of every detail, seeking out clues to indicate whether you might be chosen. Of course, at this Upper East Side sushi bar, you’re not waiting to find out if you got picked to have dodgeballs pelted at you on a basketball court. You’re waiting to see if a piece of sushi covered in gold flakes is going to be placed in front of you, or handed off to the guy a few seats down. That guy probably loves dodgeball.
At many good sushi bars, you’ll watch with some anticipation as pieces of yellowtail get topped with jalapeño and as pieces of fatty tuna are seared with a blowtorch. Maybe you’ll see some ocean trout get sprinkled with citrus salt, or some sea urchin paired with wagyu beef, as seems to be a trend these days. But at Sushi Ishikawa, you’ll see a bit more than that.
The creations here involve everything from truffles to caviar to gold leaf, sometimes all at once. And by the time you’ve watched a chef blowtorch a piece of fish, reach into a bunch of different containers, and fastidiously place one or more toppings on a piece of sushi, you’re really going to hope it’s yours. Omakase is the only option here, and each set of diners seems to get a somewhat different selection of pieces, which keeps things exciting and interesting. And just ever so slightly competitive. Sort of like dodgeball.Once you do get your pieces, you won’t be disappointed - the fish here is of excellent quality, it’s beautifully presented, and caviar on top of sushi is always welcome. That said, as the meal progressed, we also found ourselves getting fatigued at times by the excess of flavors going on in some pieces. Did that blowtorched piece of fish also need truffle shavings? Did that handroll also need little rice puffs? This is not a sushi place for purists.
It is, however, a lively, enjoyable place to have a meal, with overall tasty and unusual sushi, available at a price point that’s lower than many similar spots. You can either order 12 courses for $85, or 15 courses for $125 - both options involve primarily sushi, with a few small plates mixed in. It’s certainly not affordable, but given the long list of high-end sushi places that start their menus at $150 and up, it’s a better deal than many others.
Definitely a better deal than getting “chosen” to have a bunch of rubber balls thrown at you in a gym. If anyone can explain why dodgeball is supposed to be fun, please get in touch."

It would start with the usual talking points of water quality in the city and diner culture in Jersey, and devolve into a shouting match over the cost of living and who gets to claim Frank Sinatra.
We simply want to talk about one pizza place in New Jersey. If you insist on comparing it to similar spots in New York, then fine - Razza is better than just about all of them. But it’s not useful to put Razza in the context of restaurants across the river, because it’s not like any of them, largely due to a focus on ingredients from its home state.
Razza is a wood-fired pizza spot across the street from City Hall in Jersey City, two stops on the Path train and about five minutes from Manhattan. A chalkboard in the middle of the industrial-looking dining room illustrates where they source ingredients - heirloom tomatoes, wild yeast and flour for the dough, mozzarella and ricotta - all from The Garden State. Yes, somewhere between the shore you’ve seen on a terrible TV show and the turnpike you know from the opening credits of a great TV show, there are water buffaloes and farms with some of the best produce in the country.The pizza at Razza has thin, springy crust and light, but excellent toppings. People who enjoy meat lovers’ pies or pools of melted cheese will probably find them a bit subtle. But if the idea of simple and high-quality toppings based on ingredients currently in-season sounds good to you, then we’d recommend making a trip to Razza as soon as possible. Try a pizza like the Project Hazelnut, which features housemade mozzarella and ricotta, honey, and hazelnuts from Rutgers’ Agricultural Experiment Station. Because tasking your state university with breeding nuts only grown in the Pacific Northwest is just the New Jersey way.
But if the toppings here are The E Street Band, then Razza’s pizza crust is The Boss. The base is very thin, but unlike fork-and-knife pies with soupy centers, each slice at Razza extends straight out when you pick it up. The outer rim gets charred in the wood-burning oven in the open kitchen, but it’s still fluffy and salty underneath the crisp outside. Eating this made us feel how the people at The Stone Pony probably felt when they saw Bruce on-stage as a teenager - we can’t explain how it’s done, but we know we’re experiencing something special.
Even without the pizzas and freshly made cheeses, we would come to Razza just for the bread and butter. Yes, the bread and butter. They’re fermented and made in-house every day, and just another example of the way Razza makes the simple into something exceptional.
If you’re a New Yorker in need of a reason to visit New Jersey beyond Giants games and trips to the airport, now you have it. Razza is just further proof of what George Washington knew a long time ago - crossing the river can lead to great things. (Yes, we know it’s a different river.)"

",3.0,Italian,Scampi,6.0,"In the fall of 1982, The Delorean Motor Company went bankrupt. There were probably a few different factors behind this - but it didn’t help that their flagship car (the one from Back to the Future) had as much horsepower as something you’d buy for a nearsighted teen with poor decision-making skills and an affinity for movies starring Vin Diesel. Sure, it looked great, but there just wasn’t much under the hood. And, in a certain sense, the same can be said about Scampi. 
Scampi is a seafood-focused Italian restaurant just a few blocks north of Union Square, and it is, above all, a very well-designed place. But a lot of the food here is average (or worse), and it feels like it’s all a little more expensive than it should be. Although there are a few situations in which you might enjoy yourself here. 
If you’re redecorating your apartment, for example, Scampi might give you a few ideas. It has huge windows and high ceilings - and if you told us it was a pop-up promoting the latest furniture line from CB2, we wouldn’t not believe you. The stools, mirrors, shelves, and light fixtures all appear to be both custom and expensive, and there are several communal tables that look so nice that you almost won’t be upset if you get seated at one of them. Overall, it’s a very pleasant space, and it looks like it took a lot of effort to achieve. The food, on the other hand, feels less thought-out.The menu is made up of pastas, mains, vegetables, and crudos - and a lot of the dishes taste like something you’d eat at a nice mall restaurant on a day when the kitchen was feeling especially optimistic. Take the mafaldini “scampi”: with all its oil, salt, and breadcrumbs, it’s the food equivalent of a spring break on the Mexican Riviera or pretty much any show on Bravo. Enjoyable at first, but ultimately too much. A few other dishes are less enjoyable, and you might not even want to finish them.
That said, the desserts at Scampi are great, and the drinks aren’t bad. So if we were walking around the neighborhood and found ourselves craving a cocktail and a cannoli, we might stop by and hang out at the bar. And if someone else were paying, we wouldn’t be upset with a plate of the campanelle or mezzaluna. But the rest of the menu is hit-or-miss - so we aren’t going to tell you to risk your own dollars here. Like a sports car with a go-kart engine, this place is set up to be disappointing, and with so many other good Italian restaurants in this city, it’s not worth seeking out."

This Israeli spot makes some truly excellent brunch dishes (get the burekas), and the environment is homey but still lively. The two-tops and bar seating work well for dates, but the food here is shareable and the tables can be pushed together, so keep it in mind for group hangs as well.

",2.0,American,Empire Diner,7.3,"Say it’s a Friday night, and you’ve suddenly realized 90% of your friends are busy, out-of-town, or watching reruns of The Office whilst waiting for their Ambien to kick in. Fortunately, this still leaves 10%, and within that 10% there’s bound to be someone that’s pretty alright. This person might not be your best friend, but they can hold a conversation, they don’t try take you to Le Bain at 2am, and they typically don’t make you feel like you’ve wasted several hours of your life. This person is the human equivalent of Empire Diner.
Empire Diner has been through a few different owners in the past couple of years, and now it’s a good-looking place where you can eat some brussels sprouts and a nice piece of fish. You probably won’t start planning your next visit as soon as you leave, but the food is, for the most part, better than what you’d make at home, and the space is impressive enough to make you feel like you’re having a somewhat-special night out. 
From the outside, this place looks like a vintage diner, and the inside feels like the dining car of a train that was built to lure 20-somethings away from air travel. It’s clean and minimalist, with a bar, a few booths, a small dining room in the back, and an additional space upstairs. So if you’re looking for a restaurant that’s more attractive than the last Airbnb you stayed in, this place qualifies.As for the food, there’s fried chicken, a few salads, yellowtail crudo, and a bunch of other things that you tend to find in “new American” restaurants that have worked with a graphic designer and occasionally serve things in cast iron. And if you stick to the less-complicated things, and you should leave happy. Try the stracciatella. Or get a burger. It isn’t the best in the city, but it might be the best in the neighborhood.
You should also be able to get a reservation last-minute, even on a weekend. Which means that, much like a friend who uses read receipts and always seems to be around, Empire Diner is a solid backup plan."

",2.0,French,St Tropez,7.1,"Some early-in-the-game dates leave lasting memories. Like the time you tried to bail halfway through dinner with the fake my-friend-needs-me-call, but as you were saying, “Oh my god, okay I’ll be right there,” your phone lit up with an incoming call from Mom. 
Most first dates, though, are pretty predictable. You have one or four drinks, eat half as much as you would if you were out with your friends, and you leave unsure if you’ll ever see that person again. Similarly, you won’t walk out of St Tropez feeling like you need to come right back - but at least you’ll have found an inoffensive date spot for when you’re not quite sure how things are going to go.
St Tropez is a French wine bar in the West Village that looks like a lot of other spots in the neighborhood - dark wood everything, candles on the tables, and big windows looking out onto a quiet tree-lined street. While the one-room space gets a bit cramped, the bright side is that it’ll still feel lively when you run out of documentary recommendations and stories from your semester abroad.The French and Mediterranean small plates are shareable, and you can order in stages if you want the flexibility to stay a while longer (or leave after one course). Along with some charcuterie and salads, they serve dishes you’ve definitely had before - like meatballs, flatbreads, scallops, and charred octopus. Most of the food here is generally enjoyable, so it’s easy to leave feeling full without racking up a bill that makes asking for the check even more uncomfortable than it’s already going to be. 
Our only real problem with St Tropez is that it calls itself a wine bar - which is sort of like how your date calls himself a wine expert just because he swirls and sniffs his glass a lot. Whenever we’ve asked for wine recommendations, we’ve been told things like “everything is good,” and they don’t seem too excited to let you try things before you make a decision. You also can’t just drop into St Tropez for a glass of wine, because the tables and bar seating are reserved for people having dinner. The use-case for St Tropez is pretty specific: it works when you need to get to know someone, and want to keep the surprises to a minimum. Just make sure to take that “emergency” call in the restroom."

",2.0,Wine Bar,Have & Meyer,7.8,"At Bed Bath & Beyond, you can return a waffle iron that you bought two years prior. And if you get a membership to Costco, you can eat as many free samples as your shame will allow (typically, many). We aren’t being paid by these companies to say any of this - we just think that these are perks that probably shouldn’t exist. Sort of like the wine list at Have & Meyer.
Have & Meyer is an Italian wine bar in Williamsburg where you can choose from over 90 natural wines by the glass. If this sounds ridiculous, that’s because it is. It’s sort of like if a movie theater decided to show every current release along with the entire filmography of Nicolas Cage. It’s great and irrational - and, if all of this wine sounds intimidating, you should know that this place is surprisingly unpretentious. If you mispronounce a word, your server will get the gist, and if your wine knowledge is limited to whatever is currently on sale at Trader Joe’s, you might even learn something here. 
To soak up all this wine, there’s some pasta, charcuterie, and larger things like lamb chops and octopus. None of it is really worth traveling for on its own, but it doesn’t need to be. The wine is the star here, and, much like the non-pig animals in Babe and the anaconda in Anaconda, the food plays a perfectly fine supporting role. Have some meat and cheese and maybe a pasta while you enjoy a few wines that you never knew existed, and you’ll be happy.
If you aren’t, the servers will notice, and they’ll try to do something about it. The people here are weirdly nice (and tend to have Italian accents), and you’ll probably leave thinking that you’re more likable than you actually are. It’s a comforting place that feels like something you’d find behind a rotating fireplace in a mansion on a hill where there’s occasionally lightning. There are vintage-y lamps hanging from the ceiling and little antiques lying around, and the walls are lined with enough wine to calm every nervous flyer currently departing from JFK. 
Add all of this up, and it’s surprising that more people don’t know about Have & Meyer. It’s an ideal place to try some wine that would normally require a transatlantic trip, and you can get a seat here any night. So bring a date. Or stop by after you’ve had a long day and want to pretend that you own a wine cellar. Your server might open a bottle just for you - because that’s just what happens when a place has four tables, 15 barstools, and around 100 wines by the glass. And if your server winds up opening several bottles just so you can try a few things, don’t feel bad. Much like a quality return policy, you should be taking advantage of Have & Meyer."

",3.0,Korean,Momofuku Ssäm Bar,8.4,"For a solid few years, from about 2008 to 2011, when an out-of-towner asked us where they should be eating in New York, we had an easy go-to answer: Momofuku Ssäm Bar. Sure, there were tons of amazing restaurants opening up in the city at that time, but for a one-stop shop that captured what eating in the East Village was all about, Ssäm Bar was a pretty great bet. There were interesting things to eat, no reservations, uncomfortable seats, and a lot of pork belly. Remember how excited people used to get about bacon?
Now that we’ve gone on this trip down memory lane together, we’re going to suggest you close the history book, and store all that information in some overstuffed cabinet of your brain. Because Momofuku Ssam Bar is a pretty different restaurant now, and it’s best enjoyed if you can think about it that way.
While the restaurant overall looks similar, has the same name, and still serves a few of the same dishes, the place has evolved. For one, they take reservations (which aren’t too hard to get), and they’ve gotten rid of the uncomfortable stools. But more importantly, the menu has changed pretty significantly - where this was once a place you would only want to take people ready to go ham on some ham, menu highlights now include things like a scallop crudo and a piece of roasted skate and potatoes and burrata with garam masala. Yes, there are steaks and ribs and plenty of opportunities to make your body hurt in the morning, but overall there are more options to eat a bit lighter. Fortunately, this food is still very, very good. And much of it is also inventive, exciting, and different.They continue to serve the most iconic dishes - the pork buns and spicy rice cakes - but they’re technically off-menu. They’re still tasty and deeply satisfying, but they’re also a bit like watching reruns of Friends night after night, when you have access to an HBO Go password. They serve pork buns at the food hall in the United terminal in Newark now, you know?
If you’ve never been to Ssäm Bar then sure, get some pork buns and spicy rice cakes. But with so many Momofuku imitators around the world (and just actual other Momofuku restaurants around the world), we’d encourage coming here to try some of the newer stuff. Is it as trailblazing as it once was? Not quite. But it’s still doing stuff that feels fresh, and which tastes overall very good. These days, when an out-of-towner asks us where they should be eating, we’d have a long list to send them. But we’d work Ssäm Bar in there somewhere."

",2.0,Vegetarian,Modern Love Brooklyn,7.8,"Method actors stay in character even when they’re not on camera. Daniel Day-Lewis has a bunch of Oscars because he made the cast and crew of Lincoln refer to him as Mr. President for three months, and he learned how to trap animals and build canoes before filming The Last of the Mohicans. Regardless of the value of making a canoe before hopping in a helicopter to get to the next set location, we can’t argue with the results.
So when we checked out Modern Love, an entirely vegan restaurant in Williamsburg, did we take a page out of DDL’s playbook and avoid meat for a month? Of course not. But you also don’t need to be vegan to enjoy the food at Modern Love, a cool spot where dinner won’t feel like a compromise for anyone. 
Modern Love’s name might make you think it’s the kind of place where servers say namaste as they bring you grain bowls, or that it’s a takeout spot that sells bags of ashwagandha for $13. That is not the case. It’s a modern space with high ceilings and industrial chandeliers, and we’ve had to wait for a table each time we’ve shown up without a reservation. Also, don’t come here expecting plates of micro greens on macro greens - the food here is as heavy as you’ll find at most comfort-food places around the city.The menu is made up of vegan takes on classic comfort foods from around the world - they serve BBQ cauliflower wings and mac and cheese, but also stuff like arancini, fish and chips, and our favorite dish, the Caribbean jerk tofu. It comes with strips of spicy tofu, plantains, and coconut rice in a pool of curry, and whether you forage for ramps in the McCarren Park Farmer’s Market or you never pass up veal sweetbreads on any restaurant menu, you’re going to want to eat this.
That said, there are definitely a few places on the menu where it’s obvious there’s no butter or cheese. If you’re not used to bacon cheeseburgers that have bacon and cheese and burger, then you’ll probably enjoy the version here. We are used to those things, though, and we’d rather eat an actual bacon cheeseburger and a poutine with real gravy. Either way, we’d advise you commit to trying the more interesting items on the menu for best success.
Modern Love is a vegan restaurant, but that isn’t the selling point of this place. The selling point is that it’s a great place for a date or group dinner, where everyone will enjoy what happens to be vegan food. No method acting required."

",3.0,Spanish,Huertas,7.9,"If people actually had meet-cutes, there would be no need for dating apps. If getting your roommate to pay you back for the last eight packages of toilet paper was easy, you wouldn’t need Venmo. And if there were places like Huertas around to solve every dinner problem, you wouldn’t need us. 
But there aren’t a lot of places like Huertas. Which is why I have a job, and why you need to know that this restaurant could very well be the answer to your group dinner plans.
Huertas feels like a place you’d find in another city. A city where you don’t encounter two-hour waits for tables, and where you can actually move your elbows without touching a stranger during your meal. For the East Village especially, this place is big - with a full bar area, two giant booths overlooking the open kitchen, and a back dining room. Same-day reservations are often available, and you shouldn’t have to wait too long if you’re walking in - it gets busy, but not slammed. 
While “we can actually get in” and “we can actually be comfortable” and “we can sit in a booth” are compelling reasons to eat at a restaurant, the food at Huertas also makes it a great spot for a group dinner. From the classic patatas bravas to the saffron rice with shrimp and bacon to the octopus, all of the Spanish share plates here are delicious, satisfying, and most importantly, big enough that you can actually share them. Although you might want to get two of the off-menu hot dogs. No one wants less than half a hot dog.The one section of the menu that might require doubling up is the pinxtos (Basque-style bites), which are ordered individually. Or, just order the Pinxto Me, which gets you all six. There’s also a full section of conservas, or seafood tins, which are a fun addition if your group can get down with things like black anchovies with quail egg or sardines and radishes.
Depending on how much you like the group you’re eating with, you might wish that one of you had an apartment big enough (and cooking skills good enough) that you could all just sit around in someone’s living room, instead of in a restaurant. But that’s another reason we like Huerta’s so much for this situation - you can tell they actually care that you have a good experience. The servers are genuinely friendly, the cocktails are great (we like the refrescos, which you could drink for hours and not be extremely hungover for your 9am tomorrow), and they do things like half-off all pinxtos on Tuesday nights. Plus, tipping is included, which makes the decision to just split your check into six credit cards that much simpler.
You should come to Huerta’s when you’re looking for a neighborhood spot that’ll make it easy for you to just hang with your friends, instead of worrying whether you ordered enough food or whether your glass of wine is actually going to ever make it to the table. As for that conversation you’re all dreading having with Eliza about how none of you are going to her wedding in Bratislava? Afraid we don’t have an easy solution for that."

Every meal at Inti starts with a little bowl of fried corn kernels and spicy green sauce (good for dipping the corn and everything else). We’d be on board if Inti one day decided to package and sell said fried corn, but then there might be no Inti restaurant, and just a lucrative Inti corn corporation. 
Everything here comes in large portions at pretty affordable prices, including things like ceviche and a whole rotisserie chicken with french fries, fried plantains, rice and beans, and salad that will easily feed five adults. So the next time you need a group dinner before a show at Terminal 5 or a night out in Hell’s Kitchen, or an affordable peruvian feast in a quiet setting, Inti is the place."

On first glance, you may also mentally scroll right past Miss Ada. It’s a small Mediterranean spot in Brooklyn that serves ricotta, hummus, and chicken, which sounds like the restaurant version of another picture of that politician revealing he actually has no idea how to drive a tractor or chop a piece of wood. But we'd like to suggest that you not skip over this place, because the quality of the food and atmosphere at Miss Ada will grab your attention and keep it all the way through your meal.
As soon as you walk in to Miss Ada, you get the sense you’re in for something good: the smell of spices and meat are wafting in from the open kitchen, and everyone seems to be leisurely enjoying tables full of food and drinks. When you walk outside to the back, you’ll get the sense you’re in for something great: the backyard here is one of our favorite places to eat in Brooklyn. Outdoor dining in this city usually means a picnic table in a back alley or a few rusty tables four feet from a double-parked taxi, so drinking a lavender old fashioned and eating vegetables next to where they grow the lavender and vegetables feels extra special. Also, it’s open year-round - in winter, it’s fully covered and filled with space heaters.The food is Mediterranean/Middle Eastern - falafel, hummus, kebabs - and while they don’t use any obscure ingredients, the versions here are unlike any others in the city. The crunchy falafel topped with green tahini is served in lettuce wraps, and somehow, it’s even more enjoyable than the 2am falafel you eat on your walk home from the bar. And the hummus here is taken to new heights when it’s topped with lamb shawarma. As for the large plates, very few things give us as much joy as finding truly great chicken at restaurants, and we found truly great chicken here. You might say we should go and get some hobbies, but this brick chicken in a pool of juices marked a chicken high-point that we’ll remember for a while. 
Miss Ada doesn’t have a gold-plated bar or a menu full of ingredients you’ve never heard of. It just serves very good, reasonably-priced food in a highly enjoyable atmosphere. Dinner here is a surprisingly memorable experience that you’ll want to share with friends, or at least comment on in all caps."

",2.0,Italian,Sorbillo Pizzeria,7.7,"Think, for a moment, of the worst pizza you’ve had in your life. Mine was at a convenience store in Iceland. I’m pretty sure that the tomato sauce was actually ketchup, topped with whole sticks of string cheese. It was disgusting, and I also finished it, which was in part connected to having drunk several Smirnoff Ices, which was a very popular beverage in Iceland 10 years ago.
Now think of the best pizza you’ve had in your life. Mine was at a place by the water in Naples, Italy. Did the perfect weather, the views of the Mediterranean, and general sense of being in the pizza capital of the world add a certain something? Definitely. But this pizza was also just really, really amazing. The tomatoes and mozzarella tasted like they had been carried over to the restaurant about five minutes prior, and melded together in a way I have not experienced before or since. I’m not sharing this tale of food in a foreign country to suddenly go all Travel Channel on you. I’m sharing it because it’s relevant, as this very same pizza place, Gino Sorbillo, now has a location in New York, on Bowery and 2nd Street.Is the pizza on Bowery as good as it was in Naples? Of course not. But it’s still some of the better Neapolitan pizza in NYC. If you’ve tried Paulie Gee’s, Roberta’s, Motorino, Kesté, and so on, and generally thought they were all great, then we think you’ll find that Sorbillo can fairly join those ranks, pizza-wise. The ingredients are fresh and of the highest quality, and as in Italy, they all meld together to make that ideal tomato and cheese soup in the middle. It should also be noted that pies here are softer in the center than most other NYC Neapolitan pizzas, and really need to be eaten with a fork and knife. We know it’s against the New York rules, but just go with it here.
Those pizzas come in a dozen or so varieties, mostly of the traditional-ish nature - expect toppings like anchovies or prosciutto, not brussels sprouts or cherries or spicy honey. There’s a menu of pastas and salads and meatballs as well, which are good but also pretty similar to what you’ll find in every other East Village Italian restaurant. You’re here for pizza.The idea that you’re really just here for the pizza is further reflected in the restaurant’s perfectly nice but not-particularly-awesome-feeling interior. It’s a big, clean space with brick walls, a bar, some assorted Italian affects, and a huge, definitely unnecessary mural that says Gino Sorbillo, in case you forgot what restaurant you’re in. It would be ideal for an affordable dinner with your team from work or a casual midweek dinner or something along those lines, but it’s not as charming as our favorite Brooklyn pizza spots, or some of our other favorite East Village Italian restaurants.
Now think back to that worst pizza memory. Zone out any distractions, and really focus on how plasticky that cheese was, how soggy that crust was, and how bland that tomato sauce was. Is there a point to this mental exercise? No. We just wanted to torture you a little. What you do need to know is that Sorbillo’s pizza will be a lot closer to the best you’ve ever had than to the worst."

",3.0,Mediterranean,Marlow Bistro,7.7,"A lot of restaurants call themselves “Mediterranean” - which, if you think about it, is sort of like describing yourself as “Pacific” or “Atlantic.” Nine times out of ten, however, this term implies that a place serves either pizza and pasta or hummus and baba ganoush. Although, at Marlow Bistro, you can get all of these things.
Marlow Bistro is a restaurant at the northern end on the Upper West Side, and the menu here is about 80% Italian and 20% Middle Eastern. This means that your burrata will come on a pile of baba ganoush, and your pizza might come with some za’atar sprinkled on top. And, if you order a pasta, it’ll have anything from shrimp and chorizo to pickled ramps and feta cheese. By all means, get one - just know the thin-crust pizzas are the best things here.
You’ll enjoy them while sitting in a dining room that looks more or less like the set of a rom-com. There are potted plants, exposed brick walls, big windows, and also an old-timey espresso machine (the main function of which is to make you briefly think that you might be in Italy). We tell you all of this so you know you can absolutely bring a date. Or stop by for a weeknight meal with a friend. 
Marlow Bistro is a little more upscale than your typical neighborhood spot - but you don’t necessarily need to spend a lot of money here. You can sit at the bar and get a burger, or you can grab a table and eat a steak with a side of hummus. This is one of the most pleasant places to have a meal on the Upper West Side, and, while the food isn’t necessarily something you need to travel across town for, it’s definitely more interesting than what you find at the typical “Mediterranean” place."

The other thing you should know about Kashkaval is that there’s a fondue list that comes in five variations and three different sizes. Including fondue for one. 
In the front of the restaurant, there’s a nice bar and a few tables, but the back room is where you should try to sit with a date or a small group: it’s brick-walled, has big windows, and is generally quiet, but without being too romantic for let’s say, a third or fourth date.

Gordo’s Cantina, on the other hand, is up at the Queensboro Bridge, located next to a strip club with a broken neon sign, called Scandals. There are a few tables up front and seats at the long bar. The bartender doubles as the waiter, and makes solid margaritas. Just don’t bother asking for any substitutions - the answer will be an emphatic no.
Besides Casa Enrique, Mexican options in LIC are quite limited, so keep Gordo’s in mind as an affordable option for hearty tortas (sandwiches) and quesadillas. They serve good chunky guacamole with thick fried chips that, importantly, don’t break during scooping. The tacos all have plenty of meat - we like the pork butt, but the beef (“Gordo’s special cut”) is pretty bland. The huge burritos are worth sharing, especially the chorizo. We’d avoid most of the salads and large plates - the flank steak served with beans and rice isn’t worth $23, especially when it comes with absolutely no frills on the side."

Tournesol is ideal for a casual date night, when you can share a bunch of small plates, like the duck liver terrine and grilled shrimp with chorizo. The affordable wine list and shareable entrees, like mussels with french fries, also work well for a small group dinner.

Wells Dinette. The small cafeteria is located within MoMA PS1, a huge modern art museum in Long Island City. In order to get inside, you need to walk through the museum’s entrance, a big, spookily barren courtyard out front, and then down a couple hallways within the museum. The restaurant is run by the same people behind an expensive steakhouse a few blocks away that serves things like $150 dry-aged porterhouse, and it’s laid out like a classroom, with chalkboards, school tables, and chairs. If you ever daydreamed about drinking a beer at your desk in social studies class, this is your chance.
The menu rotates weekly, but you can expect a couple salads and heavy soups. There’s also likely to be tartare, terrine, or other rich animal spread on the chalkboard menu. This place closes at 6pm, which is part of the reason we prefer the smaller dishes, like cauliflower soup, and if they have the escargot, get it with a side of bread. If you’re looking for a unique lunch experience, eating foie gras at a desk in a classroom inside a contemporary art museum is about as far from Sweetgreen as you’re going to get."

It looks cool, and it’ll make for some decent conversation - but halfway through your meal you might start craving things that don’t have twenty different ingredients (many of which you can’t identify).
When you get a dish at Ferris, it feels like the product of a malfunctioning algorithm. The beets, for example, come with coconut, horseradish, and black tahini - and, while the first few bites are both fascinating and confusing, the last twenty are truly an effort. You will not remember this dish fondly, and you similarly won’t fantasize about the duck breast with charred eggplant jam. The duck itself isn’t bad, but the charred eggplant jam tastes like a worse version of whatever you have in mind when you picture charred eggplant jam.That said, the service here is both professional and friendly, and, if it weren’t for the food, this would be a nice place to have a meal. The space is small and intimate, and it feels like the sort of spot that could plausibly be on the Lower East Side. It’s upscale without being stuffy, the lights stay dim, and the cocktails are great.
Other than that, we really can’t recommend this place. Yes, the food might be different from what most other restaurants are serving these days  - but that isn’t reason enough to come here. When you go out to eat, the last bite of a dish should feel like the final few minutes of your twenties, or the moment when you realize that your child has grown up and is going off to his or her own life, possibly in Bushwick. In other words, you should be sad, clingy, and emotionally conflicted. And, despite how interesting it is, none of the food at Ferris will make you feel this way."

",2.0,Italian,Vini E Fritti,8.1,"If you took a survey of everything said out loud in this city, not counting expletives, one sentence would appear at the top of the results: “We should get a drink.” 
It’s the socially-acceptable way of telling someone, “I have nothing left to say to you standing on this subway platform where I was enjoying listening to a podcast, please let me out of this conversation so I can go back to it - also, you’re perfectly nice but I never really need to see you again.” But sometimes, you actually mean it. You wouldn’t mind seeing this person again, and against all odds, you’re actually going to follow up with them. And when you do, you need a place to meet. You need Vini E Fritti. 
Vini E Fritti is a Roman-style cocktail and wine bar from the same team behind Union Square Cafe, Daily Provisions, and more of the places you’d be at daily, if you were just a slightly more successful version of yourself. This place would be useful even if it were just a decent hotel bar (it’s located in the Redbury Hotel) - because it’s in the decent-bar desert between Nomad, Koreatown, and Murray Hill. But Vini E Fritti isn’t a decent bar. It’s an excellent place to drink, and an even better place to eat something too.Vini’s food menu is split up into “fritti,” a.k.a. fried things, and “non-fritti.” You should focus on the former. Not because beef tartare and crudites aren’t good, but because eating fried baby artichokes or fried pizza dough or fried pork ribs while drinking a glass of wine or a spritz is better. That said, there is one “non-fritti” that’s a mandatory order: the stracciatella cheese and preserved tomatoes, which comes on “toasted” bread (that still tastes more fried than it does toasted). It’s the kind of food you imagine you’d eat every night if you lived in Rome and were friends with the elderly lady who owned the little bread and cheese store below your apartment. Just us? Moving on.
Because this is a NYC interpretation of a Roman wine bar (and not actually a place near a little old lady’s bread shop), the bar is gold, the counters are marble, and the lights are those big globe ones you see through the windows in fancy brownstones. It’s an attractive space that’s just a little impressive - exactly what you want when you’re meeting someone for a drink. Seats are first-come, first-served, but you shouldn’t have to wait long to sit at the bar or one of the high tops. In the meantime, there are standing tables. Everyone looks cooler drinking a negroni while standing. We just decided it.
If this wasn’t clear by now, Vini E Fritti is more than just a place for meetups with people you feel obligated to see. It’s a place you should come by yourself, or on a date, or anytime you want to drink wine and eat fried snacks that inevitably turn into more drinks and fried dinner. The little old Roman lady would approve."

",3.0,Japanese,Tetsu,7.6,"In 1994, Nobu opened in Tribeca. Robert De Niro was involved, the neighborhood was actually inhabited by artists, and miso black cod was an exciting novelty. Over the next two decades, a lot happened - we’re pretty sure they now serve spicy tuna crispy rice and tuna tacos at California Pizza Kitchen, and Robert De Niro starred in a movie called Bad Grandpa with Zac Efron. But despite all that, Nobu managed to remain both a celebrity hangout and a neighborhood spot, and it also managed to keep serving good food.
But then, in mid-2017, they finally closed up and moved down to a big space in the Financial District that looks like an office lobby and/or wedding venue. We have to believe someone’s been to the new Nobu - a family of rich foreign tourists, or a few members of the fixed income desk at Deutsche Bank, maybe - but it’s not much of a hot spot. Which means there was an opening for an actually kind of cool, slightly sceney Japanese restaurant in Tribeca. And that’s where Tetsu comes in.Tetsu is the downtown, more casual, a la carte restaurant from the chef behind Masa, the $600-a-head restaurant in Columbus Circle, but it can also just be thought of as New Nobu. Located behind an inconspicuous door on Leonard Street, Tetsu is, like Nobu, a dark, trendy Tribeca restaurant with Japanese food that tastes pretty good and costs a bit too much.
The menu has plenty of options, from salads, to skewers, to cooked plates, to sushi in both nigiri and handroll form. If you come hungry, we’d recommend getting some of the bigger dishes like ribs or steak plus some salads, which are enjoyable and nicely sized. Definitely supplement with some sushi, but don’t expect it to be the core of your meal, as each piece of nigiri or handroll needs to be ordered individually. If you want to spend over $100 on a sushi meal in New York City, there are better ways to go about it.Seating comes in a few forms. If you’re a group, you’ll end up in the back, possibly at a communal table, or in the upstairs “mezzanine area.” These are both fine options, but we prefer one of the two long, nicely-lit bars. You can reserve seats at the back one, while the front one is for walk-ins - and as long as it’s not a Saturday night at 8pm, you should be able to find a seat up there. In fact, this is probably the best way to check out Tetsu - for a drink (they do great cocktails) and a few bites at the bar.
Tetsu isn’t a restaurant must-visit, but if you spend time in the area and want to drink some cocktails and eat some raw fish and don’t mind overpaying a bit to do so, then check out Tetsu. It’ll definitely be better than Bad Grandpa."

",3.0,American,Sauvage,8.0,"In NYC, you resign yourself to certain things. You’ll never see a full night sky, for example. And you’ll also never find a post office that doesn’t make you feel a deep and disorientating sadness - like when you see a whole ice cream cone on the ground, or go into a Best Buy and accidentally catch the last few minutes of The Notebook on a 65-inch flat screen. And, if you live here, you also know that it’s hard to walk into a good restaurant without a reservation on a Friday night. Sauvage, however, is an exception.
We’ve never had too much trouble getting into Sauvage. Which is weird, because this restaurant in lower Greenpoint has a lot going for it. It’s casual enough that you can wear a sweater that you’ve technically never washed before, the food is both reliably good and just a little bit interesting, and it’s one of the most pleasant places to have a meal within a two-mile radius.
It feels like a newer version of one of the bistros you see on every corner in Paris. There are red leather banquettes, a few potted plants, and some old-school ceiling fans that are probably just for show. Also, when it’s nice out, you can sit at one of the many tables on the sidewalk, eat a decent brunch, and watch the tourists wandering up Bedford Ave (some of whom are probably from Paris, which makes for a nice role reversal).Despite the name, however, the food at Sauvage is only vaguely French, and, for a place where you can eat crudités with “cloumage and Louis dressing,” it’s surprisingly unpretentious. The burrata, for example, is just piled on a plate with squash and pancetta. It’s an interesting (and successful) combination, and you’ll make a mental note to try it again. As for the mains, we wouldn’t say they’re anything groundbreaking - but the pastas are great for a place that isn’t Italian, they know how to cook a piece of duck, and the burger will make you forget about at least several minor complaints that you currently have with life.
Depending on the situation, Sauvage might even be worth traveling for. It’ll make a date think that you’re cooler than you actually are, and getting a table here shouldn’t be a problem. So if it’s a Friday night and you’ve resigned yourself to a last-minute dinner at a place where the food tastes like procrastination and low self-esteem, be aware that you have another option. Sauvage is there for you, and now you know."

",3.0,Mediterranean,Evelina,7.9,"There are certain situations where the quality of your experience can vary a lot depending on how you approach them. A Thanksgiving dinner with your in-laws might make you anxious enough to question whether true love is really worth the three hours at this dinner table. But, if you go in knowing that your father-in-law really, really hates NAFTA and that his idea of current popular culture is “the MTV,” then you increase your odds of having an enjoyable night.
At Evelina, the quality of your experience will also be dependent on going in with the right mindset. If you make use of the knowledge that this is a dark and relatively intimate spot where you should stick to the pasta section of the menu, then you will maximize your chances of having a nice dinner before the evening gets underway.
This is a Mediterranean restaurant in a part of Fort Greene that’s packed with good neighborhood spots, but Evelina feels cooler than most of them. The sleek space and dim lighting make it an ideal place to share some interesting wines and pastas with a date or small group. Each time we’ve come, the tables and long bar have been full of people who looked like they enjoyed their coffee get togethers and decided that dinner probably wouldn’t be a total waste of time. How likely these early-in-the-game daters are to come back to Evelina depends on what they order, and if they agree on things like spirit animal compatibility.The menu of Mediterranean small plates, pastas, and wood-fired entrees rotates weekly. We enjoyed most of the starters, and the persimmon and beets topped with stracciatella is one of the best salads, and appetizers in general, that we’ve had in a while. While the waitstaff will tell you that you can’t go wrong with any of the entrees, we strongly recommend sticking to the pastas. All of them come with a substantial amount of meat or seafood, and the portions are certainly shareable. The squid ink pasta with uni and crab, though, is one that you won’t want to share, even if your date tells you that going halfsies would mean you two can do Thanksgiving in the Caribbean this year. The non-pasta mains, like the branzino and roasted chicken, tend to be forgettable and kept this restaurant’s rating from being quite a bit higher.
Whether or not you leave Evelina eager to return is in your hands. This is not one of those spots where simply walking in the door assures you a great night ahead. You need to go in with a few key points in mind - this is not the place for a rowdy group dinner, stay away from the non-pasta entrees, don’t mention spirit animals. This preparation, like arriving at Thanksgiving with “avoid globalisation and hip-hop” scribbled on your palm, will greatly increase your likelihood of having an enjoyable dinner."

",1.0,Russian,Nargis Bar & Grill,7.6,"When you make the effort to leave your apartment for a meal, it can be tempting to choose a restaurant for more than just food. You ditched the Snuggie for real-people clothes and hit pause on your Black Mirror marathon. After going to such great lengths, you may want to go to a spot where getting a reservation requires more preparation than a cross-country bike trip, or a place with artfully presented avocado-stuffed avocados.
Or maybe you don’t care if getting a reservation is more difficult than getting into a good New York preschool, regardless of the fact that preschool is just sandboxes and nap time. If you replaced your slippers with shoes and watched the screensaver appear on your AppleTV because you simply want some good food, then check out Nargis. This Uzbek restaurant in Park Slope serves excellent food in a very casual setting.The food, which has influences from Eastern Europe, the Middle-East, and East Asia, ranges from hummus to pumpkin-filled puff-pastries to spicy noodle soups with lamb. It’s all hearty, affordable, and the portions are large, so this is not the kind of place where you’ll need to search Google Maps for nearby pizza places while paying the check. Most of the dishes are worth ordering, and the lamb, beef, and chicken kebabs that’re cooked over a wood fire are excellent. If you’re a fan of high quality meat on a stick, which we sincerely hope that you are, these are some of the best you can find in the city. 
Despite its prime Park Slope real estate, you’ll feel comfortable showing up at Nargis in gym clothes, or if you happen to leave your apartment still wearing those slippers. The food comes out extremely quickly, the paper placemats are decorated with maps of Russia, and the speakers play a heavy dose of Natasha Bedingfield. But, Nargis serves good food that will make you happy you ate here, and that’s the reason (we think) this place has been packed every time we’ve visited. People also probably realize that Black Mirror marathons cannot be good for the heart."

It’s especially painful for those of us who’ve moved up here from greener pastures of high-quality restaurant options. And if there’s one category of restaurant that’s especially lacking on the Upper East Side, it’s the kind-of-healthy, reasonably-priced place you can go to again and again. But Blake Lane is here to change that.
Blake Lane is a fantastic neighborhood spot that’s great for a casual meal and even better via delivery on your couch. The menu is nice and varied - there are gem lettuce salads, chicken salad sandwiches, vegetable bipimbap, tuna tartare toast, and poke - so you won’t ever get bored on your quest to not eat a burger tonight. They do brunch well (when you should get the breakfast tacos), but lunch and dinner are superior. 
The restaurant itself is small and generally crowded, but still an ideal meet-a-friend-and-catch-up type of spot, and 100% the kind of place you can come in your gym clothes. In other words, it’s a revelation for the Upper East Side."

",3.0,Japanese,Tokyo Record Bar,8.3,"You don’t go on a cruise because it’s the quickest way to Alaska. You go for the opportunity to eat a lot, swim in an undersized pool, and stare out at the ocean while you pretend that you’re the ruler of a big blue world where parties start at a reasonable hour and television seasons never end. In other words, it’s an experience - just like Tokyo Record Bar.
Tokyo Record Bar is in a basement in Greenwich Village, and it has either two or three seatings per night, depending on the day. Each involves a seven-course tasting menu (which costs $50 per person), served in a little space that looks like something you’d find down an alley in Shibuya.  It’s perfect for a more-creative date night, and it’ll impress any friends or out-of-towners who, at some point in their lives, started believing that you’re the sort of person who does interesting things.Once you get seated here, the first thing you do is help make the soundtrack. A server hands you a brochure with around 100 different records, you pick a song or two, then the DJ takes everyone’s selections and turns them into an all-vinyl playlist. Expect to hear everything from Biz Markie to Patsy Cline, and know that even if you pick some ABBA or “Nuthin’ but a G Thang,” you will experience nothing but the love and support of your fellow diners.
Around the same time that the playlist begins, your first course will arrive, and it will probably be a piece of caviar sushi. The food here is Japanese izakaya-type stuff - oysters, salmon sashimi, and, toward the end, something like monkfish or pork belly. The first few dishes will probably be better than the rest, but you still won’t hesitate to finish anything as you sit and observe the scene around you.
A meal at Tokyo Record Bar is almost like a form of interactive theater, and there isn’t really anything else like it in NYC. It might not be the absolute best food in the city - but that’s also not the point. You don’t just come here to eat. You come for an experience that’ll make you realize that both David Bowie and Beyoncé were always meant to be listened to in a dark basement on MacDougal Street where there are cherry blossoms on the ceiling and anthropomorphic foxes painted on the walls. Much like a cruise to Alaska, it’s about the trip. And the slice of pizza they give you at the very end also doesn’t hurt."

Nowadays, we only live in an apartment or specific neighborhood for a couple years. Then a Whole Foods opens down the block, and your landlord decides this justifies a 40% increase in rent. Or your go-to restaurant around the corner, where you sat in the same seat three nights a week, turns into a poke place serving mocktails with decorative straws.
Regardless of which neighborhood you currently call home, Pheasant will feel like your ideal local spot. It’s a Williamsburg place where everyone seems to know each other - a feeling that’s increasingly rare in this neighborhood. People nod and make room for you at the bar when you walk in, and as soon as we sat down, we started talking to two strangers (who we now know as Lucas and Hannah) at the table next to us. All of this amounts to something that resembles more of a dinner party than a restaurant, which helps make up for the fact that you will end up spending a great deal more at Pheasant than you would on the six-pack of Lagunitas IPAs you normally bring to such gatherings.If you want to have a good and affordable dinner here, your order is the crispy chicken wings followed by the pressed burger with potato wedges. The fairly large order of wings are drizzled with yogurt, and the burger is topped with a slab of smoked kielbasa and aged provolone. Order other things on the menu, and you run the risk of eating something bland, overpriced, or both. For example, if you start with the roasted octopus and the yellowfin crudo, you’ll have spent $30 for a handful of relatively forgettable bites. With that, you could have gotten two nice six-packs, depending on the bodega.
If you live in the area, then hanging out at Pheasant will make you feel like you’ve found your neighborhood spot. The food may not justify a trip from other parts of the city, but then again, getting to Williamsburg would be a whole lot easier than picketing in front of that new Whole Foods."

",2.0,Chinese,Birds Of A Feather,7.8,"Much like a bodega without a credit card minimum or a Facebook video that makes you feel like a more complete person, a good group-dining place can be hard to find. Typically, you need something affordable, spacious, and at least somewhat good-looking, in case you have a friend who’s saving up for real estate in Calabasas and needs to document every life experience on social media. Also, the food should be good.
Fortunately, Birds of a Feather meets all of these criteria. It’s a Szechuan place in Williamsburg, and it’s perfect for a dinner with friends when you want to eat somewhere nice, but don’t want to spend a crazy amount of money.
The menu here is huge, few things cost over $20 (with gratuity included), and the space looks like a store that would sell yoga mats made from recycled yoga mats. It’s bright and roomy, with some big windows up front and a communal table in the middle. One thing you should know, however, is that the bar isn’t very big (or comfortable) - but you shouldn’t be dining solo here anyway.The best way to enjoy Birds of a Feather is with a group. Why? Well, first off, conversation is nice. You might even say it enhances a meal. Also, you’ll want to try a little of everything here. Start with the soup dumplings and wontons in chili oil, and go from there. As for entrées, you can get anything from a whole steamed fish to some tea-smoked duck. For something spicy and crowd-pleasing, order the Chungking or three-pepper chicken.
With only a few exceptions (like the not-great ma po tofu), the food here is very good. And, while Birds of a Feather doesn’t quite make the list of best Chinese restaurants in NYC, it’s still a great Szechuan option in a neighborhood that could use more places like it. So go ahead and stop by with some friends. It’ll make everyone happy, and that’s a rare thing - like a Facebook video that isn’t somehow cat-related or a subway conductor who asks, “Everybody in?”"

Like when the teacher calls on you to present your book report, and you’re about as prepared as Billy Madison was to answer that question at the academic decathlon. You’re going to end up rambling about a lost dog and wishing everyone would stop staring at you.
Others clearly embrace the spotlight. The bridesmaid during her tear-jerking toast. Your niece on her birthday or Thanksgiving or Wednesday. And Dirty French.
This large bistro from Major Food Group (the people behind Carbone, Sadelle’s, and The Grill) has been around for a few years now, and in that time, it’s grown on us. We initially experienced some inconsistent food and service, and generally concluded that it focused more on being a scene than serving quality food. But we’ve been back several times recently, and have found that those issues have been smoothed out, while the production value that makes dinner here a great experience has stayed intact.The theatrics here would be a lot to deal with on a regular basis, but every now and then, in the right situation, they make for a fun night out. From the neon pink sign out front to the magnums of old Bordeaux being paraded around the room, Dirty French is not big on showing restraint. This isn’t the kind of place you come for a deliberation on Proust. You come here and end up debating what kind of Jordans the waiter is wearing.
Some restaurants that put so much focus on showmanship approach the actual meal as an afterthought, but most of the food at Dirty French is good enough to stand on its own. While the menu lists traditional-sounding French items, dishes are more complex than the descriptions let on. The duck a l’orange, for example, is coated in North African spices, while the black bass comes with a madras curry. Also, definitely say yes when they ask if you want bread, because that’s just a good way to live your life, but also because you’ll get slabs of warm flatbread drenched in herbs and olive oil and served with soft cheese.  It’s some of the best free bread we’ve eaten in this city, and that’s not a designation we hand out lightly.Not every single dish is this good - and those that go lighter on spices don’t quite stand up to the energy of the setting. The bridesmaid wouldn’t be able to make everyone cry if she gave a scripted speech in monotone. Similarly, the hangar steak and brook trout don’t pack the same amount of flavor as many other dishes here, and thus get drowned out by the very dark lighting and loud music.
With said dark lighting, loud music, and not-cheap prices, Dirty French isn’t an everyday restaurant. And at some point, the people treating the walk to their tables as fashion week auditions may start to weigh on you, and you may start to wonder why that huge mirror over there is covered in black wax. But if you’re ready to embrace the production of it all, then you can expect a very good dinner and a very entertaining night out."

Let’s call this friend Sebastian. Why Sebastian? Because it’s a really cool name. Sebastian has done some sh*t. He’s trekked the Peruvian forests in search of cacao and base jumped off some impressive-sounding bridges you’ve never heard of. Sebastian has stories. Lots of very interesting stories. Unfortunately, the reality is that Sebastian also probably wears blazers with no undershirts and flies on private planes to Tiesto shows in Ibiza. 
Imagine if Sebastian had all of those experiences, but was actually just a nice guy who wears jeans and likes The Black Keys. In that case, Camperdown Elm would be the restaurant version of Sebastian.
Camperdown Elm is an ordinary-looking spot on the Park Slope/Windsor Terrace border named after an old tree in Prospect Park. It has about 30 seats, plus a long bar with views of the kitchen. Upon first glance, it appears to be another small Brooklyn restaurant with plenty of exposed brick and distressed wood. One look at the menu, however, and you’ll quickly realize that Camperdown Elm has a lot more to it than it lets on. 
Nearly every dish has an ingredient that will prompt you to type into your iPhone before the waiter returns. But don’t worry, because fortunately, much like our friend Sebastian, the waiters are happy to enlighten you without being condescending. Ours named the 12 types of Japanese mushrooms that accompany the scallops, but then simply said that the tartare is “off the chain.” While we debated ordering another round of fried muffins, he hummed along to the Black Keys.The best dishes at Camperdown Elm might remind you of places like Wildair and Olmsted - restaurants serving phenomenal food in casual settings. The octopus alone would be a must-order, but the bed of blood sausage makes this an absurdly good appetizer. Camperdown Elm’s bites of fried chicken thigh served with Japanese mayo may be the best chicken nuggets we’ve ever had. The dry-aged ribeye is so intensely flavored that we initially dismissed the accompanying steak sauce like a lemon wedge after a shot of expensive tequila. (We did end up ordering those muffins, by the way, and used them to mop up the steak sauce.)
Despite these high points, Camperdown Elm also has its fair share of dishes that are more focused on being unique than tasting good - and that’s what keeps this place from being on the level of the Wildairs and Olmsteds of the world. You’ll be able to tell your friends that you ate squid crackers with king mackerel pate and suckling pig with clams, but you probably won’t need to come back for another order. Additionally, on most of our visits, the space was relatively empty, which made us feel like we were sitting in a restaurant after close, eating off-menu creations from the chef.
At the end of the day, you’ll be happy you spent time with Sebastian. Sure, some of his stories are better than others. A few may not even make sense. The good ones, though, you’ll remember. The same thing goes for Camperdown Elm - you’ll walk out of this neighborhood restaurant having tried things you’ve never tasted before. No private flight to Ibiza needed."

It’s still run by the team behind Hundred Acres (which also owns the easy, reliable Vic’s and Cookshop), and they’ve made it into a Middle Eastern/Mediterranean place, serving things like kebabs and salads and a bunch of different vegetables and even some pink-colored hummus, which you might find endearing. It’s food everyone will want to eat, and all of it tastes good.Additionally, portions are pretty big, and with most dishes under $20, prices are very fair as well, particularly for the neighborhood. They also have plenty of space, with a bunch of big tables. It’s a win for any time you get stuck being the one who has to plan a moderately priced but still semi-nice brunch or dinner, in a convenient location, for people with assorted dietary wants and needs.
If anyone says this is their favorite restaurant in the city, you should probably take them out a bit more, but that’s also besides the point. Because Shuka is like watching You’ve Got Mail on a long plane ride - a safe choice you’ll be reasonably pleased with."

",2.0,American,Minnie’s,7.2,"Imagine you’re walking through a mall, maybe enjoying a Cinnabon, when you run into someone you went to high school with. You don’t remember this person’s name, but you do remember the fact that they weren’t mean to you  - so you stop and chat for a second, then get on with your life and never think about them again. This nice, hypothetical person is the human equivalent of Minnie’s. 
Minnie’s is likable, but if there were a giant flood, and we could only save a few restaurants, this place probably wouldn’t make it onto our ark. If it just so happens that you don’t have a reservation on a Friday night, and you need a nice spot to eat with a friend on the LES, it works just fine.
In terms of setup, this is a pretty ideal place for a casual meal with one other person. It’s just one square room on a relatively quiet corner of the Lower East Side, and the walls are lined with little two-person tables. There are also plenty of big windows, and, if you removed all the furniture, the space could pass as someone’s studio apartment. When we talk about Super Cute Reasonably Priced Restaurant To Catch Up With A Few Friends, this is about what we have in mind.The food itself is enjoyable enough, although it mostly feels homemade. Normally when we say this, it’s a compliment (and a slight exaggeration) - but we’re pretty sure we could actually make a lot of the stuff they serve here. Take the roasted chicken: it comes with sautéed greens and mashed potatoes, and it both looks and tastes like the sort of thing we’d cook on a Sunday night. Like pretty much of all the food at Minnie’s, it isn’t bad - but it also isn’t really why we go out to restaurants. 
That said, you probably don’t always feel like cooking, and sometimes you don’t have the option of staying in. So if you need an easy place to eat with someone who wants to tell you about their year, and you don’t necessarily need a dining experience that’ll make you want to quit your job, move to France, and get shouted at in a French kitchen, this place fits the bill. There’s food for everyone (including anyone who still eats quinoa), and the burger is pretty decent. Sure, you probably aren’t going to create any lasting memories here, but sometimes that’s just fine."

",3.0,American,The Four Horsemen,8.6,"When you’re young, your time gets sorted into categories. School time, homework time, karate time, Nintendo time. RIP Nintendo time, we’ll tell our kids about you when they’re playing with their iPhone XXVIs.
But when you enter the real world, all those clear categories go away. You’re left with working, sleeping, and something in between those things to keep you from losing your mind. Which means it might be time to look for a new extracurricular. Something that you’ll actually want to stick with, unlike the oboe. 
Have dinner at The Four Horsemen, and there’s a good chance you’ll decide that wine should become that extracurricular. Not just drinking it (although mostly drinking it) - but becoming the sort of person that knows a little bit about it.
If wine school doesn’t sound all that exciting to you, know that at The Four Horsemen, your class is dinner and drinking, and your classroom is a tiny little spot filled with people who look like they’re in bands you don’t know but should. Coincidentally (or not), this place is partially owned by James Murphy - the LCD Soundsystem James Murphy. While there are probably tourists who come in here looking for him (or because they saw it on Master Of None), the crowd mostly feels like people who are here often. The space is half bar and half dining room, low-lit, always packed, and covered in the kind of light wood that makes you think for a second about that trip to Scandinavia you still want to take.The Four Horsemen focuses on natural wine, and if that’s simply a buzzword to you, know that it basically means it’s been made by smaller producers, without too many added chemicals or high-tech machines, and that it’s likely to taste a bit funkier than your standard $12 bottle of Pinot. No matter how busy the place is, or how many band members are at the other five tables around you, the people working here will happily walk you through the list and help you find something you’ll like. You’ll want to stay here long enough to keep trying them. You know, all in the sake of learning. 
You could easily spend a whole night here just trying wine, but the food is what will make you want to come back. Like most wine bars, there’s cheese and charcuterie and olives and even homemade bread and butter. But we rarely even eat those things (except the bread), because there’s so much other good stuff: raw and cured fish with interesting toppings like fennel and Thai basil and roe, clam toast with pancetta, ribs with plum glaze, and an excellent plate of fried potatoes.
So the next time you have some free time on a Saturday, and you start panicking about what it means that you have free time on a Saturday, come to The Four Horsemen. It works for dates, for friends, and for just being alone. Get a glass of wine and a couple plates of food in front of you, and you’ll have found your new extracurricular."

",3.0,American,Fedora,8.5,"At one point in your life, you had a dream. It involved a townhouse with hardwood floors and perfectly-level art on the walls. There, you’d host dinner parties, and, near the end of them, someone would summarize something they’d read in the New Yorker. And you’d just sit there with a cup of decaf, thinking about how nice it is not being that person. 
Maybe you had this dream for a while, or maybe it occurred briefly when you passed a Banana Republic and stared too long at the window display. If it happens to still be a dream of yours, we recommend you go to Fedora. 
Fedora is a restaurant in the West Village from the same people who own Joseph Leonard, Jeffrey’s Grocery, and Bar Sardine. It’s one narrow room in the basement of a townhouse, and it feels like a casual dinner party at the home of a person who’s been to Milan at least twice. It’s dark and intimate, and, while it isn’t new anymore, the whole place seems to be getting better with time. 
The menu here follows a pretty familiar formula: brussels sprouts, pork belly, roasted chicken, and other things that you’ve thought about making before drinking half a bottle of wine and ordering delivery. It might not sound exciting, and it isn’t going to win the James Beard award for Best Weird-Ass Modern Food - but it’s comforting, and you’ll finish all of it. The roasted chicken, for example, is one of the best in NYC, and the brussels sprouts have enough bacon and butter to qualify as an alternative fuel source.So maybe don’t come here with someone who uses a napkin to take the grease off their pizza. But do come with a friend who’s had either a very good or very bad week. As soon as you walk down the steps and open the front door, your friend will feel just a little bit better. And, once inside, you’ll find a restaurant that’s as fancy as you make it - by all means, put on something you can’t afford and have a date night here. Just know that the servers all wear t-shirts, and, as a rule, that means you can as well. 
Factor in the possibly-vinyl soundtrack coming from a small speaker in the corner, and what you get is a place that feels less like a restaurant and more like a living room that was converted into a supper club. The employees treat you like a friend, and the food is all exceptional - but still within the realm of what you could plausibly make at home. Which is to say, this place is the fulfillment of your West-Village-dinner-party dream. Use it accordingly."

",2.0,American,Fish Market,7.0,"Describing Fish Market feels dangerously close to a real life Stefan run-down of New York’s Hottest Club: it’s a sports bar in the South Street Seaport that serves Chinese and Malaysian food with $16 lobster specials on Mondays and Tuesdays and a bartender named Jeff who likes to do free shots of Jameson with nearly everyone who comes inside. 
Like all good cult-followings, this place is random to those who don’t know it and essential to those who do. The basic gist is that Fish Market is a neighborhood sports bar in the Seaport that happens to serve a really good a mixture of Chinese and Malaysian food. The menu is huge, with sectioned off American bar snacks, vaguely Italian pasta plates, and Chinese and Malaysian options. While their traditional bar food is good, we’d recommend sticking to that last section, which includes things like ginger chicken wings, Mama’s curried chicken, or the pork belly pot. The sports bar setting, salt level, and big-portion-low-price options will trick you into thinking you’re eating very satisfying drunk food, even if you’re not drunk whatsoever.
It’s not a huge place, but the bar and table areas feel pretty distinct from each other. The bar will probably have the Ravens game on TV and a man who has never left the South Street Seaport and likes to wear Ron Jon Surf Shop sweatshirts, while the back will have several tables full of young people who work or live in the area and have a regularly scheduled hang here. Regardless of where you sit, it’s likely to be pretty loud because of the jukebox and the group having an alcohol-themed birthday party.
Fish Market is useful for people who live or work around here, because why else would you be in the South Street Seaport? Otherwise this place is worth checking out if you find yourself on the non-Brooklyn side of the Brooklyn Bridge and want an inexpensive and randomly delicious dinner in a fun place with a dedicated following. Or if you’re just confused by how all of this happens under one roof and need to experience it for yourself."

",2.0,Thai,Ugly Baby,8.0,"People like experiencing new things. It’s why we travel and move and attend workout classes with names like Beebe’s Buttcamp. It’s also why we go to restaurants. Trying a new place after work brings something exciting to your otherwise-pretty-mundane Tuesday. Unless you’re one of those people who works at Space X, or your job title is “Futurist,” or you’re a celebrity doula. In which case, congratulations and enjoy your night on the couch. 
But for the rest of us, there’s Ugly Baby - an easy and excellent place to try something new. This restaurant serves food from all over Thailand, and it’s about the closest you get in NYC to feeling like you’re actually eating there, instead of in a little BYOB spot in the Brooklyn suburbia that is Carroll Gardens.
Ugly Baby is a single room with a handful of tables, a few bar seats overlooking the kitchen, and very little in the way of “vibe” - other than the walls, which are covered in rainbow murals. It kind of feels like what a restaurant would look like if you let artistically precocious eight-year-olds get high on Gushers and then have at it.
Based on the look of the place, you might not initially think Ugly Baby is the restaurant to help your boring Tuesday. But once your server drops your menu, you realize this is all stuff you haven’t seen at other Thai restaurants around NYC. The staff will happily explain things, but they’re mostly concerned with telling you how spicy each dish is. If they can tell you’re not prepared, they will make sure you’ve been warned. Go forth with confidence. Your Tuesday deserves it.And yes, a lot of the food here is very spicy, but not in the way that makes you feel like the world is closing in on you and you might not make it out alive. The spiciness at Ugly Baby isn’t there to punish you - it’s there to make things taste better. 
Most things here are worth ordering, but there are a few dishes so good that the other stuff on your table will get a little cold as you attempt to get them into your mouth as quickly as possible. One is the Khao Soi Nuer, a spicy curry noodle soup with beef shank, which you will think about longingly the next time you order a noodle soup somewhere else. Another is the Kah Moo Palo, described on the menu as “five spice pork leg stew.” That doesn’t do this justice: it’s a giant pork leg, covered in a layer of scrunched-up fat that looks kind of like a pug’s face. Lift up that layer (and do your best to forget about the pug’s face) and you will find some of the best pork you’ve ever eaten. It’s the kind of thing that gets dropped on your table as though it’s just another plate of noodles, when it actually deserves to come out in a parade with fire twirlers. And a herd of pugs. 
That’s exactly why Ugly Baby is perfect for a meal when you need to feel like your life isn’t just a repeating cycle of staring at your laptop and staring at your iPhone. It’s simple and affordable, and serves food you might not have ever tried but absolutely should. And it’s infinitely better than a butt workout."

",4.0,Italian,Del Posto,8.8,"Choosing a restaurant in New York for any old Friday night dinner can easily lead to a state of indecision paralysis. Do you go to an old favorite, or try something new? Do you want to hedge your bets on a place that doesn’t take reservations? Will the restaurant be ever-so-slightly disappointing, causing you to leave wishing you’d spent your money elsewhere? Would the place next door have been better? If you think this way, you’re probably very ambitious, and you’re also possibly terrible on dating apps.
And that’s just for a standard Friday night. When the stakes for dinner are even higher, it’s easy to get even more paralyzed. For most of us, going out to the kind of restaurants where you’re expected to eat from a $100+ tasting menu and possibly wear a sports jacket isn’t something you do very often, if ever. But if that’s an experience you’re looking to have for a special occasion, let us make this easy for you with what we’re calling the Fine Dining Decider.
If you love fish and are happy to stay in Midtown, it doesn’t get any better than Le Bernardin. If you want to be able to order a la carte and enjoy feeling powerful, try The Grill. If you like the idea of “tradition” and would happily go to France on all your vacations, you’d like Daniel. If you don’t care about tradition but are very rich, consider Momofuku Ko. If you like pasta, dramatic staircases, and the idea of being downtown, go to Del Posto.Del Posto is a big, dark space right off the West Side Highway and 16th Street that looks and feels a bit like a private club. It’s a little too fancy to be described as “cool,” but it’s also not stiff or uptight. The restaurant is set over two floors with a dramatic, fairly steep staircase, and if you sit upstairs and drink a bunch of wine, be careful when walking down.
There are two ways to go about dinner here. First, there’s a $149 four-course prix fixe option where you get to pick your appetizer, two pastas for the table, an entree, and dessert. Second, there’s a full-on eight-course chef’s tasting menu for $179, of which there’s also a vegan version. Whichever way you go, you’ll eat fantastic high-end Italian food, so the choice really depends on how much of a control freak you are. Based on what we established above, you’re probably a pretty big control freak, but we’d say as long as you’re not picky, leaving it in the kitchen’s hands can make for a memorable evening. If you’re willing to cut the evening part out, a meal at Del Posto can be had for a third of the price at lunch, when there’s a $49 three-course option, with an additional (and recommended) $10 pasta supplement.
Del Posto is not the place to come if you’re looking for a fine dining experience that involves wacky foams and gels and molecular gastronomy elements. It is the place to come if you like the idea of eating great pasta and a perfect piece of fish or veal, and you’d like to be treated like you’re at a five-star European hotel as you do it. New York is always going to be full of too many good choices (and probably even more bad ones), but as long as you enjoy excellent Italian food and outstanding service that makes you feel special, you’ll walk out of Del Posto pleased."

",3.0,Italian,Don Angie,8.4,"Enter into a relationship with someone, and after a period of time between four months and four years, you’ll be asked to take part in a double date. You might all genuinely be friends, but the double date is often a slightly forced affair - dinner with your coworker and her never-before-seen spouse, or with your boyfriend’s high school friends who you’ve never met and have been a couple since they were 16. You need somewhere that has interesting and impressive food, and which will make you look like you’re cool and in-the-know. But you also need somewhere that everyone - even the picky half of that high school couple - will enjoy.
You need Don Angie.
Don Angie definitely ticks all of those boxes, but there’s also a very practical reason to come here with four people: many of the dishes are large and you’re going to want to order a lot of them. Take the stuffed garlic flatbread, which comes with eight cheesy, highly enjoyable pieces, or even the impressively-sized chrysanthemum salad. After that, you’ll want at least two of the pastas (we strongly endorse the gnocchi and the garganelli) and you might also want to try the $64 lasagna “for two,” which is both expensive and filling for two people if you want to order anything else. And you will want to order something else - the entrees, which range from a great piece of grilled fish or steak to a veal cutlet topped with cured meat, are excellent as well. If you eat here with just one other person, you might leave with a sense of existential dread about what you didn’t get to try, and probably also some unfinished dishes. We can tell you that from experience.Don Angie will also do you right for this hypothetical daunting double date night because the food is equal parts exciting and accessible - anyone you think at least qualifies as a mid-tier enjoyer of food will like it. Take the gnocchi, for example. It’s covered in poppy seeds, but is also basically just a bunch of cheese-filled dough balls. The best approach to ordering is to get some of the pastas and entrees to share, but if that coworker’s mystery spouse decides they just want a piece of chicken to themselves, Don Angie works for that too. Although much of the menu isn’t particularly healthy, a lot of the dishes are covered in salad, if that’s any consolation.
The restaurant is also dimly lit and sleek, with lots of leather and shiny things that feel like they could be on a fancy sailboat or luxury condo bathroom. In other words, it definitely has the date night feel. The space is pretty small though, meaning it’s not really a big group kind of place either.
So gather a few people, one of whom may by the significant other of someone you kind of know, and take them to Don Angie."

",2.0,American,Old Rose,7.6,"Close your eyes, and think about all your friends. We’re willing to bet that at least one of them is pretty cool, but also kind of a jerk. Maybe this friend doesn’t respond to your texts and always seems to have new clothing despite the fact that they work in publishing. Or maybe he or she shows obvious potential, but has yet to do anything that would make the person at the gates of the afterlife say, “Oh wow, I’ve always wanted to meet you.” If this friend were a restaurant, it would be Old Rose.
Old Rose is in the bottom of the Jane Hotel, and it feels like a ballroom that someone converted into a cafe. The ceilings are high, there are some big windows, and the walls are covered in paintings of centaur-like creatures doing stereotypical centaur things (drinking, playing the flute, etc.). It’s spacious, there’s room for groups, and it even feels kind of special.
The menu, on the other hand, is pretty straightforward. It’s Italian, and it has a few pizzas and pastas, a kale caesar, and some smaller things like octopus. And, while that might not sound very exciting, you should know that they do these staples pretty well. The pastas are solid, the pizzas are great (especially the clam one), and their side of meatballs with stracciatella is the sort of thing you dream about after you step in a puddle then see on Facebook that your ex is getting married to a person who’s slightly more attractive than you.Although not everything here is Italian. The pork ribs come with a sweet & sour sauce that could exist at a well-managed Panda Express, and the crispy rice salad with mint and pickled jalapeño feels something you’d get at a place like Dimes. We aren’t sure what these foods are doing on the menu, but they’re interesting, and they make us wonder what this restaurant could be if it weren’t just trying to be the millionth spot to serve cacio e pepe. 
We also wonder what this place would feel like if it weren’t so casual. Here, you get your silverware out of a can on your table, and the service is about about on par with that of a diner in a world where CNN just informed everyone that a meteor is headed toward Earth. Food arrives slowly and sometimes out of order, and the bartenders are borderline mean (and not in a way that makes us like them due to daddy issues).
Still, Old Rose isn’t a bad restaurant. It’s actually pretty good - but it can be pretty frustrating, and its potential makes us a just a little bit sad. Fortunately, it’s affordable enough that you can look past certain defects and still have a good time. Come with a friend on a weeknight or stop by with a group on the weekend when a lively conversation will distract you from any lapses in service. We, personally, will be coming back - if only for the pizzas and the fact that you don’t just stop liking your friend because they’re kind of a jerk."

",2.0,Mexican,Claro,8.3,"Seasons make people - especially New York people - very excited. That first day in September when it’s not 90 degrees and sweaty? People can’t get their scarves on fast enough. We’ve seen real adults huddled around the Muji notebooks and pencils section in September like they’re trying to will themselves back to Psych 101. And the fact that La Colombe, the coffee shop whose cups you used to rely on to make you seem cooler, now sells a pumpkin spice latte? We’ll leave it at that.
Sometimes it feels like we’re all just trying to make ourselves feel better about having seasons. If we get excited about scarves and pencils now, maybe when it’s 20 degrees and filthy-snowy in a few months, we’ll all be less miserable. 
Go to Claro, and you won’t be able to lie to yourself anymore: New York City would be a much better place if it was always summer. This Mexican restaurant in Gowanus is great - but when you get to eat on their back patio, it’s outstanding.
Claro’s big backyard is full of trees, string lights, and most importantly, an open kitchen. The best seats in the restaurant are at the outdoor bar, where you can watch your tortillas being made over an open fire while drinking a frozen mezcal cocktail. It reminds us of Salazar - an entirely-outdoor Mexican restaurant in Los Angeles - and if you’re unfamiliar, all you really need to know is that a meal there could convince anyone to move to the West Coast.But the reality is that we don’t have that kind of weather. For half the year, outdoor eating is like junior year of college - a distant happy memory you don’t want to think too hard about, for fear that it will make you sad. 
Here’s some good news: Claro serves some of the best Mexican food we’ve had in NYC. Which means you should still come here even if it’s winter. The indoor space is basically just a room, but that doesn’t matter when the food is this good.
The menu is a take on Oaxacan food, and most dishes on it are both delicious and slightly different from other Mexican spots in the city. They make their tortillas in-house, and even when they come topped with spicy-smoky chile sauce, a pile of pork, and cheese, you can still taste how good the tortillas underneath all that are. That dish is the memela -  other highlights here are the ceviches, tlayudas (basically Mexican pizzas), and their fantastic mole. The menu changes (yes, seasonally), and isn’t particularly long, but what they do, they do extremely well. And that includes the cocktails and desserts, which are worth ordering in multiples.
Claro might be in the middle of Brooklyn, but it serves the kind of food you expect only to find in places that don’t have snow. We haven’t yet tried it as an alternative to one of those seasonal affect disorder lamps, but we have a feeling it might just work."

Your boring coworker might say, “A cloud.” And the sarcastic one that no one likes might say, “Coffee.” Then, depending on how weird everyone else is, you might get things like “a bird,” “a different bird,” or “Caesar and Cleopatra on the royal barge.” Well, congratulations. You just made a Rorschach test. And if you want to try another, check out The Loyal.
The Loyal is in the West Village, it’s whatever you want it to be. It’s perfect for a fun night out, and it works just fine for a dinner with some parents. It’s also nice enough for an anniversary dinner, but it isn’t so prohibitively expensive that you couldn’t come here with a friend on a Thursday night. And feel free to bring whomever.
No matter who you take, they’ll find something to eat. The menu here is dense, with some 1950s-cruise-ship items like a lobster cocktail and other things that feel interesting and new like “drunken” eggs and mushroom carbonara. And, while there’s definitely a lot of meat here, vegetarians will have some options that won’t feel sad. This place is from the same people behind Nix, after all.There are, in fact, so many options here that you might be a little skeptical. The thing is: pretty much all the food is very good. We wouldn’t say there’s any one standout dish, but most of the stuff here is worth ordering. Even the smaller things like the plate of fried mushrooms and radish salad are great. You should, however, be sure to order at least one of the pastas (they’re appetizer-sized, so actually maybe get two) - and if you’re looking for a new burger, try the one here.
Maybe even stop in and eat it at the bar. They serve the full menu there. Although if you’re with a group or a date, get a table in the dining room. It tends to be dark and crowded, and, with all the booths and mirrors, it sort of feels like a place from the ’90s - somewhere you might’ve seen James Spader, Freddy Prinze Jr., or Winona Ryder before she started playing home-improvement guru Joyce Byers on Stranger Things. 
In the end, The Loyal feels celebratory. Which isn’t to say you need to wait to come here. Sure, it’s great for a birthday dinner - but if you want to bring a few friends on a Friday night or a date who is seemingly okay with your corgi obsession, it works for that as well. There are a lot of ways to look at this place, but, inevitably, you should see something pretty great."

",3.0,Middle Eastern,Nur,7.7,"When some restaurants open, you get the sense that they’re trying to figure things out. Maybe the servers don’t know the answers to any of your questions, or the menu doesn’t quite feel like it all goes together, or they forget to bring one of your dishes and then try to make up for it by sending you a side of cauliflower you definitely didn’t want. 
Nur, a modern Middle Eastern restaurant in Flatiron, is not one of those restaurants. From the start, it knew exactly what it was trying to do: serve exciting Middle Eastern food in an exciting New York City restaurant. Which isn’t a surprise, since the guy behind Nur is one of the best-known chefs in Tel Aviv. 
In terms of food, they’ve mostly succeeded. Many dishes are interesting and delicious and just a little bit insane - like the eggplant dip that looks like what would happen if the spiral emoji took acid. As for the restaurant itself? The room is packed and music is blasting - it might be exciting, but it’s not the most pleasant place to eat.We’ll start with the good: there are some very high highs of a meal at Nur. The highest of which happens when your bread - a laptop-sized sesame bagel, a whole loaf of garlic and honey challah, or a pillowy mound of pull-apart kubaneh - hits the table. Whether you’re with one or four other people, in that moment everything will become a blur of limbs and carbs and dips and when it’s all over, you will be sad.
Luckily, there are other excellent things to eat after the bread: the aforementioned eggplant/acid spiral, “date doughnuts” that are actually smoked trout croquettes, and a pita stuffed with lamb and cheese to make what’s essentially an incredible hot pocket. There’s also the Casablanca Chraime - a pot of rich red fish stew that’s easily the best entree here.
That’s mainly because it’s delicious, but also because you get a lot - whereas Nur’s other entrees are pretty small portions for the money. Which is another thing: even if you don’t order the $37 lamb entree that only comes with two small pieces of meat, a meal here can get expensive quickly. 
And while the price point feels special occasion-appropriate, the rest of the details don’t. Nur’s below-ground, low-ceilinged space is like a garden apartment StreetEasy would refer to as “charming” (translation: cramped). They also play the Today’s Top Hits playlist from Spotify, loudly. Desserts like the “Hills of Jerusalem” sound cool, but come out looking like an architecture student’s senior project and tasting less good than the pint of ice cream in your freezer at home. 
Nur isn’t a perfect restaurant, and it’s probably not the place to go for a high-stakes occasion. But if you’re in it for the creative Middle Eastern food, and you have some money to get rid of, you won’t be disappointed. Plus, there’s no cauliflower to be found here."

",2.0,American,Popina,7.8,"Sometimes when you take two good things and put them together, you get something better. Other times, the result is worse. Let’s use Kanye West as an example. On one end of the spectrum, you have Watch the Throne, and toward the other end there’s that kindergarten-birthday-party song he did with Rihanna and Paul McCartney. Popina is somewhere in between. 
This restaurant does a mashup of Southern and Italian cuisine, and while it isn’t quite Kanye and Jay riding around in a Maybach with the doors chopped off, we’d say the combination works pretty well. Here, they make hybrid-sounding things like pappardelle with ham hock ragu and arancini that come with honey and butter. They also make a spicy chicken Milanese that tastes like something you’d get at a KFC drive-through in heaven.
The only issue is, none of these things are as original as they sound. They’re good, and they should all be on your table - but they don’t necessarily taste like dishes you’ve never had before. And that’s probably because, in the end, this place only feels about 10% Southern - which means that it’s essentially a very good neighborhood Italian place.
So whether or not you should go to Popina is really going to depend on what neighborhood you live in. If you’re in or around the Columbia Waterfront District (the little area between Brooklyn Heights and Red Hook), you should have this place in your rotation. If you live elsewhere, just know that the closest subway station is about 14 blocks away (and that the G train might be involved). 
You should also know that the space is pretty small. Sure, there’s a big backyard where you can have a drink while you wait for a table - but, for some reason, they don’t serve food out there. So maybe don’t plan any group dinners here. This place is, however, kid-friendly, and nothing costs over $30. So if you happen to be in the area, try it for a weeknight meal or a more-casual date night. Just be aware that, while this a great Italian spot, the Southern elements are mostly singing backup."

",2.0,American,Daily Provisions,8.4,"People like to complain about life in New York City. And while we generally feel like those people are welcome to go live anywhere else, it’s true that things are harder here. Running dumb errands becomes a game of strength and strategy when you don’t have a car to do your schlepping. Coordinating a group dinner is basically an exercise in neighborhood diplomacy. And locking down a decent apartment takes nothing less than witchcraft (or faking an engagement in order to convince your landlord of your relationship’s stability - true story).
So when you find the easy wins in NYC, they feel especially important. 
Daily Provisions is an easy win. This is the tiny all-day cafe from the people behind Union Square Cafe, and it’s located right next door to its fine dining sibling. But while Union Square Cafe is a white tablecloths and sommeliers kind of place, Daily Provisions is an order at the counter and possibly eat while standing up kind of place (there are two small counters and two small tables, and that’s it for seating). The setup and price point of these two restaurants are different, but the quality of food is on the same level.
Every sandwich at Daily Provisions feels like the platonic ideal of its category - from a bacon, egg, & cheese so good that at $7 it actually feels like you’re stealing something, to a crispy chicken milanese on focaccia, to the roast beef with muenster and horseradish that we wish would teach a master class to all other roast beef sandwiches. And then there’s the Daily Provisions cruller, which is officially the best donut in the city. We are more confident about this statement than most other things in life.All of this would make for a sad story if Daily Provisions were as mobbed as it should be, given that it’s a very good thing in the middle of New York City. But it’s not. This is a well-oiled machine that manages to feel mysteriously calm at all times, and you can tell they’ve put a lot of thought into the details. The people running the cashless register keep the line moving quickly, and you don’t have to awkwardly figure out how to tip because it’s already included in the prices. If you’re staying to eat there, they’ll bring your food on real plates, and you’re taking it to go, they’ll package it nicely. Additionally, there’s housemade hot sauce on every table, the ice cream comes from Portland’s incredible Salt & Straw, and whole loaves of their excellent bread are available for you to take home (or squander into your work bag for emergency snacks under your desk).
Easy wins are rarely as easy or as winning as they seem, and we’ve come here looking to find problems. But we have yet to find a real fault with Daily Provisions. This is exactly what it promises to be: a neighborhood cafe that’s delicious and fast. Unlike most things in New York City, it actually makes you feel like you’re getting away with something."

We also don’t know Jared Leto, but that’s another person we’d take to this little Lower East Japanese restaurant. Does anyone know some cool artists who lived in Soho in the 80s? Please extend our invitation to them to eat dinner at Gohan.
If our imaginary Gohan dinner party hasn’t painted the picture, we’ll explain it in more concrete terms: this is a peaceful, low-key place serving Japanese food that’s inspired by home cooking. This restaurant is right around the corner from lots of new-ish, hyped-up restaurants like Kiki’s, Mission Chinese, Cervo’s, and Dimes, but it’s kind of the quiet kid in the neighborhood.
In terms of food, it’s kind of the quiet kid too: nothing is overly spicy, or overly salty, or overly anything really. While you can eat a few fried things or some noodles, there’s plenty of tofu and sashimi, as well as a general feeling of healthiness permeating the air. It’s not healthiness in the extreme, but you won’t leave here with acid reflux and a sense of existential dread. As you might have guessed by now, it’s a good place to bring a vegetarian.
It’s also a good place to bring a friend for a casual weeknight dinner, or an easy meal with someone you’ve been dating for long enough that going out for a meal isn’t a whole thing anymore. Of course, it’d also be a good place to bring Jared Leto, just as soon as he responds to that DM."

",2.0,American,Chez Ma Tante,8.5,"Walk by Chez Ma Tante, and you have no reason to believe it’s any different from any other Brooklyn restaurant. It’s an all-white spot on a quiet corner in Greenpoint, with a long wood bar and a few tables outside. The lighting fixtures are nice, but there’s no other decor. It’s not empty, but it’s also not packed. The menu posted on the door includes a roast chicken and a caesar salad.
It all sounds boring as sh*t. But it’s not. And that’s because the food is fantastic.
While lots of restaurants try very hard to make interesting food and end up with dishes that look like edible versions of tchotchkes you’d buy in an overpriced design store, Chez Ma Tante is focuses on making straightforward food taste extremely good.The menu is mostly made up of familiar dishes, all turned up several notches. The caesar salad tastes like they took every radicchio leaf individually and made sure it was coated with an unreasonable amount of pepper, garlic, breadcrumbs, and cheese. The insanely juicy roasted chicken sits in a broth that should be administered via I.V. when you’re sick, and served with grilled buttery bread and a huge spoonful of aioli. There’s falafel that, instead of being the sad option for vegetarians, is super flavorful, satisfying, and fresh - and one of the best things here. The pancakes are left in a cast iron pan long enough to get a thick fried char on them, and are absolutely worth making a trip out of bed for any Saturday morning. 
You might go to other restaurants for their theme or scene or inventive vegan take on Asian-Italian-Mexican fusion. You’re not going to Chez Ma Tante for any of that. You’re coming here for excellent food, and a simple setting designed for the sole purpose of feeding you. There are no gimmicks or distractions, so bring someone you’ve already decided you like, or want to get to know. There’s a good shot the feeling will be mutual. At the very least, they’ll realize you weren’t as boring as they thought."

",2.0,Seafood,Cervo’s,7.6,"Food doesn’t have to be fancy in order to be good. Just look at most pizza. Or go eat some seafood in pretty much any coastal area. It probably won’t need much to taste great. Olive oil, salt, some other sh*t - we don’t know, we aren’t chefs. But at least a few people at Cervo’s are, and they seem to be familiar with this concept.
Cervo’s is from the people behind Hart’s, one of our favorite restaurants in Bed-Stuy, and the two places have a lot in common. They’re Mediterranean-inspired and fairly casual, and they both serve good, unpretentious food. There are, however, two key differences: Cervo’s is on the Lower East Side, and most of the menu is fish.
Here, you’ll find a lot of small things like sardines with radishes, a “crispy” egg with anchovies, and a plate of clams in a white wine sauce. The food is Portuguese/Spanish, and it’s all pretty straightforward in a home-cooked sort of way. The tuna conserva, for example, is basically just a great tuna salad with some lettuce, hazelnuts, and a ton of olive oil. It isn’t especially high-concept, but you probably wouldn’t be able to replicate it at home.There are also a few larger things here, and if you’re especially hungry, these are what you should focus on. The menu changes daily, but there’s pretty much always a whole fish (something like porgy or mackerel) and the same lamb burger they do at Hart’s. Compared to the sizes of the starters, both of these things are relatively good deals. 
And that’s one of the main things you should be aware of here. Two hungry people could probably eat every small plate at Cervo’s and still have room for a run to Shake Shack afterwards. This is the double-edged sword of quality seafood. It’s pricey, and the portions tend to be small. The clams, for example, are about $16 and amount to maybe one mouthful of food.
Keep that in mind if you’re on a date - a scenario that Cervo’s is pretty perfect for. This place is just one long, narrow room with a bar up front and a few tables in the back, and they keep the music at a volume that’s just right for when you want to look into someone’s eyes and tell them that you’d like to adopt a dog together, or that you’re willing to give up a life of crime to be with them, or both. 
Just be sure to bring someone who really likes fish, and know that this isn’t the very best place to eat a full meal. If you want to hang out, have a glass of wine, and snack on some simple food that tastes like the ocean, however, this is a pretty ideal spot."

",3.0,American,Diner,8.8,"Like Napster, Nokia, and the guy we saw last week taking a Citibike onto the East River ferry, Diner is a pioneer. This tiny spot inside a dining car underneath a bridge was one of the first excellent restaurants to open in WIlliamsburg. And if you haven’t been back recently, consider it your duty to do so. 
We’re not just assigning you a meal at Diner because it’s a classic - we’re telling you to come here because, after many years, it’s still truly great. The burger alone is worth traveling for, and the rest of the menu feels like what would happen if someone went to the farmer’s market, came home, drank three negronis, got some sort of divine intervention, and started throwing stuff onto plates. It’s interesting, fun, and most importantly, really f*cking good. The same goes for brunch, which is just as impressive as dinner, if not even more so.
But no matter when you eat here, it always feels like an event. For one, it’s in an actual dining car. So if you run out of things to say to your date, you can casually ask what she thinks the 19th century petticoat-wearing train travelers would have to say about the tattoos and cutoffs crowd that now fills the space. (Actually, please don’t, that’s a terrible icebreaker.) Also, while it’s a pretty big dining car, it’s still a dining car - with low ceilings, narrow walkways, and very little room for privacy. The people-watching here is second to none.
Beyond the setting, Diner also has a signature party trick: the servers scribble the day’s offerings directly onto your butcher-paper tablecloth. Turns out you don’t need menus when you have the kind of staff who can make a two-minute illustrated food monologue something you’re actually excited to witness. By the end of it, your server might be squeezed into your booth with you, helping you plan your order. It’s over the top, kind of intense, and the type of thing that, anywhere else, would feel awkwardly forced. But at Diner, it’s all part of the magic. And the magic is still going strong, more than 20 years after opening.
So actually, this restaurant isn’t really like Napster or Nokia or even that guy who’s probably going to get caught by the Citibike police. Diner isn’t just a pioneer - it’s here to stay."

",3.0,American,Marlow & Sons,8.9,"Some things will always be cool. Bruce Springsteen. White t-shirts and leather jackets. Dr. Dre. The other side of the pillow. 
Marlow & Sons is another one of these things. It’s not trying hard to have some crazy or even particularly unique concept. Its coolness is the kind of thing that a lot of restaurants try to make happen, but this place just inherently has. 
Marlow feels like a clubhouse - probably because that’s actually what it was when it opened. Along with Diner (owned by the same guy), Marlow & Sons was one of the first great Williamsburg restaurants, where people who lived in the neighborhood came to hang out. These spots are located right next to each other, serve the same kind of seasonal food, and are always packed with equal numbers of locals and European tourists staying in nearby Airbnbs. The key difference between them? Marlow & Son’s Feel Good Factor comes from nothing other than the Feel Good Factor itself. While Diner is set in a tiny dining car where the servers sit down in your booth to dramatically scrawl out the menu on your tablecloth butcher paper, Marlow & Sons is relatively simple: it’s just a laid-back place to have a reliably excellent meal.Marlow & Sons is consistent, but never boring. Despite being around for over a decade, they keep things feeling fresh here with a menu that changes daily. Open starting at 8am, you can come in the morning and eat a fresh-baked biscuit breakfast sandwich or eggs with whatever vegetables are in peak season. At dinner, there are only two constants - oysters and chicken roasted under a brick. Otherwise, what you’ll eat depends on what they feel like making. Add to that the genuinely nice staff, and you get a restaurant experience that feels like you’re being cooked for by friends. Friends with good taste in music, who know a lot about wine, and how to make things like chicken liver pate and beef shoulder with black tahini.
When you picture a “Williamsburg restaurant,” it probably looks and feels a lot like Marlow & Sons. And that’s because this place is the original Williamsburg restaurant blueprint. It’s now a classic, and for good reason: it’s still better than almost everything else around it.
White T-shirts and leather jackets optional, but recommended."

Obviously we’ll never know the answer to this question - but at least Jajaja is easy. Should you eat here? If you’re a vegan, the answer is yes.
Jajaja is a vegan Mexican restaurant on the part of the Lower East Side where you’ll find Dimes, Scarr’s, Kiki’s, and all the people who hang out at such places. The menu has things like a fake chorizo burrito, a “sausage” egg and cheese torta, and five different kinds of vegan tacos. And everything’s pretty decent. Sure, maybe the tortillas here could use a little work (and the food sometimes arrives at room temperature) - but the dishes don’t taste aggressively vegan, and your meat-eating friends will probably be just fine with this place.They might not go crazy for all of the food (vegan meats typically taste like something you’d eat in the cafeteria of a spaceship on a twelve-year scientific expedition), but they will, at the very least, be into the atmosphere. This place has a cursive neon sign, a pastel color scheme, and a multi-colored margarita that comes with a paper straw that collapses in about five minutes (but looks great until then). It’s fun, lively, and the median age hovers around 26.
Of course, if you or a loved one aren’t currently living an all-plant lifestyle, you should probably just go a restaurant where the “carnitas” tacos aren’t made with hearts of palm. Acceptable as the vegetables are here, real carnitas are about ten times better. But if you aren’t currently eating meat and you want some reasonably-priced Mexican food in a nice little space, come here."

",3.0,Mexican,Empellón,6.9,"Empellon has three locations, two of which are downtown. Taqueria is good for an easy date night in the West Village, and Al Pastor is a little spot on St. Mark’s where you can eat a cheeseburger taco at 1am. Both are pretty casual, and you wouldn’t think twice about wearing t-shirt to either of them. The new location in Midtown, on the other hand, is big, flashy, and feels sort of like the first studio picture from an indie director who finally got tired of his sh*tty craft services table. 
Compared to the other Empellóns, this place is a blockbuster. Although in this particular film, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are played by sea urchin roe and steak tartare. And, like most summer blockbusters, Empellón Midtown is a little excessive and kind of disappointing, and it might come in handy if you have a few people to entertain.
Here, you’ll find octopus tacos, uni nachos, and wagyu fajitas. We don’t have a problem with any of these things, but, at Empellón, none of them are quite as good as you hope they’ll be. They aren’t bad - but if you’re the one paying the check, you might lie awake at night and wonder what else you could have done with your money. Take, for example, the fajitas. They’re $125, and they come with about four domino-sized pieces of beef.Although, to be fair, nothing else costs close to $125, and most other dishes are at least borderline worth-it. Feel free to try the crab and uni nachos. The concept is a little Flavortown-esque - but they’re fun to eat, and there’s plenty of crab and uni. The tacos are also a reliable order, especially the ones that overlap with the menu at Taqueria. 
Would we rather have the tacos from Los Tacos No. 1? Of course. But you can’t bring a client or a date to a place like that. You can, however, bring them here. Empellón has two floors, an open kitchen, and a giant shelf of all-white sculptures that look like they were looted from a ceramics class before glazing day. It’s a great-looking space, and it works for anything from a team outing to your mother’s tequila-themed 50th birthday. The service is also top-notch, and the restaurant is lively without being too loud.
So if you need a last-minute place to impress a group of clients, out-of-towners, or a date who cares more about your body language than the mouthfeel of their queso - this place is a viable option. Although if you aren’t stuck in Midtown, you might as well just go to Taqueria. It doesn’t have the same production values, but it’s less gimmicky, more intimate, and makes this Midtown outpost feel like a Spider-Man reboot from a young director who should be doing more interesting things."

",3.0,Indian,Babu Ji,7.3,"When we first went to the original Babu Ji, we couldn’t stop talking about it. From summer to fall of 2015, while other people were starting conversations with questions like, “What TV shows are you watching now that Mad Men is over?” and “Should I really see a hip hop musical about Alexander Hamilton?,” we were asking everyone we encountered in NYC one thing: whether they’d tried Babu Ji yet.
That first U.S. iteration of Babu Ji (they started in Australia) was something very special. The small, bright room on Avenue B was buzzing, the service made you feel like you were a guest at a cool dinner party, and there was an overall sense that you’d stumbled into a one-of-a-kind spot. And the Indian food - a mix of traditional dishes with some twists - was really, really good.
Unfortunately, that original Babu Ji is no more, but they are back in business with a new space on 13th and 5th. While some of that 2015 magic is gone, you can still have a nice meal here.
The magic has gotten lost in the shuffle largely because the new location near Union Square is bigger and more corporate-feeling. That’s not to say it’s the kind of place you’d find in Midtown, but it’s also no longer the kind of place you’d find on Avenue B. It’s a bit like your favorite web series getting picked up by HBO - there’s a guy in a suit walking around now, and you’re not exactly sure what his job is other than to look important. To make the most of the space, you definitely want to sit upstairs if you can. The self-serve beer fridge is up there, and it’s brighter and a bit more fun than the dark, below-street level ground floor.The menu is more or less the same as it was before, and there are traditional dishes like Tandoor Chicken, as well as more creative ones like General Tso’s Cauliflower. We’ve found that when everything’s going smoothly, the food here is still very, very good. But we’ve also experienced a few service hiccups where dishes came out not quite warm enough, or all at once very quickly. If you want to guarantee comfortable pacing of your meal and want to try a lot, you should consider the $62 tasting menu, which lets you sample a big mix of the menu, and isn’t a bad idea if you’re willing to spend. A la carte will certainly cost a bit less, but it’s not going to be a cheap meal either way - the dishes aren’t huge and they do add up very quickly. There isn’t a right or wrong way to do it.
Put it this way: bringing up Babu Ji isn’t going to be our lifeline in cocktail party conversation anymore. But if you never made it to the original, or are looking specifically for quality Indian food in a nice environment, we’d confidently send you to Babu Ji.
For what it’s worth, we still haven’t been to Hamilton."

If you missed this gem of mid-2000s MTV programming, the concept was simple: take a sh*tty car, fix it up, and then add gratuitous features like a chandelier or the ability to shoot flames out of the back. And always trick it out with a sound system that could support a Guns N’ Roses concert. Whether or not the cars actually worked afterwards, Pimp My Ride was broadly entertaining. I once watched a marathon of episodes with a six-year-old who didn’t speak English, and we had a great time. Because the language of putting a hot tub in the back of a pickup truck is universal.
Applying the Pimp My Ride philosophy to a restaurant is usually nota great idea. It might make for entertaining circa 2005 television, but adding a bunch of flashy superficial features can only take you so far. Fortunately, Cote doesn’t take this approach.
Cote is a “fancy” Korean BBQ restaurant in Flatiron, and if they had an MTV show it would more likely be called “Let’s Just Buy A Really Nice Car With A Quality Engine And Italian Leather Interiors And Also Make Sure You Get The Heated Seats.”
This place is basically Korean BBQ, turbocharged. Each element of the dining experience is taken up a notch - it begins with the high-end steakhouse-quality meat, but extends to the fancy grills, the smooth marble tables, and the sharply- dressed servers.You’re welcome to order however you want here, but most people will go for the $48 per person prix fixe option, which gets you four different kinds of top quality prime beef, plus several banchan sides, a savory egg soufflé, two different stews, and a little cup of soft serve to finish off. You can also add on a few other appetizers like steak tartare or larger accompaniments like bibimbop, but the Butcher’s Feast comes with more than enough food. The steak is truly excellent - rich, tender, buttery - to the extent that you’ll want to eat some of it on its own before wrapping it up in a lettuce leaf with one of the provided sauces.
To go along with it, you’ll definitely want something to drink, and Cote has some excellent options on the booze front. There’s a frozen rosé, which you can laugh at until you actually drink it, as well as a bunch of original cocktails that are strong, unusual, and really good. They have a pretty serious wine list too, and a big wraparound bar up front, so stopping by for an after-work drink is not a bad idea at all.
Cote isn’t a replacement for the Koreatown BBQ spots that are great for rowdier, more affordable group gatherings - we’ll never stop going to those places. It’s simply a different concept. Kind of like having a chandelier in your car."

",3.0,American,abcV,8.5,"There’s a restaurant review from the late London critic AA Gill that is one of our favorite things ever written about food. Gill sets up his criticism of a local vegetarian restaurant by dedicating a few hundred words to the idea that pandas are bullshit because they are the only mammal that chooses to be vegetarian, even though they have all the necessary facilities to eat meat (incisors, carnivore’s metabolism, bear DNA). He then parlays that into his argument that eating only vegetables in a restaurant is also bullshit.
This is not necessarily a view we share, as you can probably tell by the rating sitting at the top of this review. abcV is Jean-Georges’ third restaurant inside of the ABC Carpet & Home furniture store. It’s entirely meat free, and we think it’s the best of the three.
But our recent meals at abcV keep bringing that AA Gill review to mind. Not just because this is a vegetarian restaurant, but because the success of this restaurant and so many others like it has made it abundantly clear that we, advanced human beings, are basically becoming pandas.That fact is no more apparent than when you try to get a reservation here, which can be very difficult, especially at dinner. This place is consistently packed with big groups of people sharing a bottle of wine and a head of cauliflower and having no problems with the fact that there is no meat on this menu. As a matter of fact, they might not even notice.
And that’s the thing about abcV. That it is an entirely vegetarian restaurant is not the point. It’s just a feature. There’s no need for an asterisk, where we say that the food is great *for a vegetarian place. It’s great without a caveat. The menu is big and diverse, split into sections like “Grains & Legumes,” “Warm and Sustaining,” “Vegetables,” and “Brunch Bowls.” That last one we are opposed to on principle, but otherwise it’s hard to go wrong.
But the thing we like most about abcV is that they aren’t out to make a vegetable into something else. There’s no cashew cheese, and nothing is labeled as a “steak.” They just source great vegetables at the green market and make them into something delicious. Or find something creative to do with a dosa, or serve you an incredible plate of “wild fried rice.” There’s no sleight of hand, and we won’t cheapen it by trying to hit you over the head attempting to convince you that “even your most carnivorous friend will like it.” Because they will. All of your friends will like it.

Or maybe you mutter Harry Potter spells in your boss’ general direction, hoping she’ll lose some fingers so she can no longer type “please advise.” Our chosen power would be to un-taste things, so that we could eat them for the first time again.
That first time trying the food at Emily’s original Clinton Hill location is something we would like to be wiped from our brains, so that we could do it all over again. And if we could un-experience the original Emily altogether, we have a feeling we’d be a lot more excited about Emily West Village.
To be clear, the food at the new Emily is very good. Great, even. If you’ve never been to the original Emily, it might blow your mind. But if you have, it just won’t feel the same - or taste quite as good.
The bar is set unbelievably high - the original Emily in Clinton Hill is a special place. It’s not only home to our all-time favorite burger in the city, but also to some fantastic thin-crust pizzas. And the small room, while fairly bare-bones, has some undeniable magic to it. The second location, Emmy Squared, in Williamsburg, serves thick, square Detroit-style pizzas and some incredible sandwiches. It’s the first place our mind goes when we decide we want to do something terrible for our bodies.
Emily West Village’s menu is essentially a mashup: there are thin-crust pizzas along with Detroit-style pizzas (though with different topping combinations than the other two locations), and a burger that splits the difference between the Emmy burger from Emily and the Le Big Matt, the double-stacked burger served in the basement of Emmy Squared.It’s all impressive stuff to put in your mouth, whether you’ve been to the other spots or not. But if you have been to the other Emilys, you might be a little disappointed. You might miss the original, thin-crust Colonie, or the thick-crust Roni Supreme (neither of which are on this menu). You might start thinking you can actually taste the difference in the pizza oven. And you’ll probably miss the old space, with its homey feel and super-friendly servers. Especially if you get seated in the basement room of the bi-level space - it feels like a dungeon down there.
If you’re someone who gets existential about pizza, know that we’ve considered the fact that a place deserves to be judged on its merit alone, without its history attached. While Emily West Village is the least-good option of the three Emily’s, it’s still a damn good spot on its own. If you’re set on sticking around Manhattan, and you want a taste of Emily, the West Village location is absolutely worth of your time. Even better - try it during lunch, when you’ll be able to skip the four-hour wait. Come to think of it, that goes on our superpower wishlist."

(Maybe if we call eating pasta by a different name, it will be OK to do it again.)
Now that you have some background, you probably have some questions. Is it really as good as that one little trattoria outside of Siena that I love? Is someone’s Nonna in the kitchen? How much pasta can I reasonably eat in one meal?
We’re not going to sit here and tell you that Fiaschetteria Pistoia is the second coming of that Bottega del Something place you stumbled into a few years ago on vacation in the Tuscan countryside. As a matter of fact, we’re not even going to tell you that it’s as good as the best rustic Italian restaurant in New York City. But we will say that if we were to rate Fiaschetteria Pistoia on the pasta alone, this restaurant would sit near the top of the stack in this town. When it comes to simple, authentic, near perfect classics like cacio e pepe or pappardelle al ragu, you’re gonna have a hard time finding better.
As for the overall experience, we find Fiaschetteria Pistoia to be pretty damn charming. The staff is incredibly friendly, the wine list is presented to you in the form of six or so bottles sitting in a milk bottle rack with tags around the necks listing price and varietal. It’s a pleasant place to spend some money eating well and imagining what it would be like to live a simpler life - one in which you work with your hands during the day and drink wine with your friends at night in some beautiful place that isn’t the corner of 11th Street and Avenue C. 
Unfortunately, there are also some things about Fiaschetteria Pistoia that we don’t love. The food outside of the pasta is inconsistent at best. We’ve had mixed results when wandering off into the “secondi” section of the menu, and consistently bad experiences with most of the things that they list as daily specials. On one visit we found a dish called “Hammer Down Shrimp” on offer, which we quickly learned was not something delicious named after a Primus song, but a plate of raw shrimp that had been poorly cleaned, flattened, and barely seasoned. No thank you. We’ve also consistently been annoyed with the fact that the red wines are poured at somewhere around 86 degrees. I don’t know where they store the chianti, but it tastes like they’re keeping some of it in the oven. That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t order wine here, but make sure to ask them to chill your bottle down a bit before you drink it. 
So, to answer your question, no a trip to Fiaschetteria Pistoia is not a replacement for a trip to Italy. But it is a perfect spot for a laid back Tuesday night dinner. Just make sure to stick to the pastas - and bring your least enlightened friends."

",2.0,American,21 Greenpoint,7.8,"Most activities we played as kids don’t exactly hold up. Tamagotchis were really cool, but then we got cell phones. AIM is now Tinder. Checkers have always been the worst. But forts? Forts have always, and will always, be an exciting thing.
Pillows, sheets, chairs, and all the Oreos/Cheeze-Its in the cabinet  - you used whatever you could find to build a mystical lair in the middle of your living room while the babysitter watched The Blair Witch Project. Now that you have neither a babysitter nor ample space in your living room, you can try to recreate the fort experience by camping, but that involves dirt and effort. You could ""glamp,"" but that requires hundreds of dollars to stay in a trailer. Or you could just replace your bed with a tent. But we’ll go to 21 Greenpoint.
The whole restaurant feels like a hideout. If you weren’t looking for it, you’d never just pass it - it’s in a townhouse almost at the water’s edge in Greenpoint. The space is long and narrow, with lots of smaller nooks and crannies for making your own. If you want to drink and eat alone, the giant v-shaped bar is your spot. If you want to meet someone for a noncommittal date, there are-not-overly romantic two-tops by some windows. If you’re looking to spread out with a crew, walk towards the back where you’ll find multiple levels of tile-and-wood tables, hanging plants, and other things you’d want to outfit your fort (or apartment) with. Even the bathroom is in an A-frame hut in the middle of the restaurant, if you need a place to camp out when your date starts to take a turn for the worst.But one thing your fort definitely never had was food this good. 21 Greenpoint serves seasonal American stuff - but before you fall asleep just reading that phrase, know that theirs is actually interesting. Sure, you can get good pizza here, and there’s always a pasta and a burger - but there’s also super seasonal stuff (like an outstanding bowl of beets, watermelon, and goat cheese), and in the place of your standard roast chicken there’s a roulade involving hummus, bacon, and merguez. It’s the kind of menu where everyone can find something they like, or, even better - everyone can share a bunch of different things and walk out feeling like they got to try a lot.  
To be clear, 21 Greenpoint is very much a grown-up place. It’s an interesting-feeling spot, with interesting-tasting food, and an atmosphere perfect for hiding from all the annoying adult things you have to take care of. That said, picking up a package of Oreos on your way home is never a bad idea."

",3.0,Japanese,Uogashi,6.2,"We’re on a perpetual hunt for excellent sushi that doesn’t cost $100-plus a person, so we were excited to check out this East Village spot that does a $75 omakase - and which got some rave reviews elsewhere. Unfortunately, we didn’t love it, and there are much better options in this price range. Because $75 (which is over $100 once you factor in tax, tip, and maybe a drink) is still a lot of money.
The omakase does get you a lot of food, but the sushi pieces are weirdly oversized in a way that’s not particularly appealing and the fish variety wasn’t very impressive either. It’s a decent option for a few rolls or pieces a la carte, but it’s not a must-visit. At all. The space is somewhat sanitary-feeling, and has those plasticky wood floors that give the room a bit of a cheap feel.
Want to spend between $75 and $100 on some really, really good sushi? Go to Sushi Katsuei, Sushi Dojo, or Tanoshi. Want to spend less, somewhere in the East Village? Try Kanoyama or Hasaki."

",3.0,Mexican,Atla,7.9,"If you’ve ever wandered around one of the fancy downtown neighborhoods - Noho, the West Village, Tribeca - in the middle of a weekday, you may find yourself asking one very particular question.
Who are all these people out to lunch on a Tuesday?
Sure, you’ll see Soho business types doing lunches at Balthazar and Lure Fishbar, but we’re talking about a different breed: the people at The Smile and Joseph Leonard, the ones wearing skinny jeans and expensive sneakers. If it’s a Friday afternoon, they might even be drinking white wine. There are sunglasses on the table.
Beyond assuming the word “consultant” is somehow involved, we can’t tell you exactly what it is these people do for a living. But we can tell you that they have convened at their quarterly meeting and decided on a new hangout. That place is Atla.Atla is a casual Mexican restaurant on Lafayette, run by the well-known chef who also owns Cosme, an excellent restaurant and Place The Obamas Once Ate. It’s a small, skinny place, in the ground floor of a high-end condo building, with big windows, muted colors, and a few green plants scattered around. Like Cosme, it’s cool and simple-looking, but the menus at the two restaurants are very different. Where Cosme does an uni tostada with bone marrow salsa, duck carnitas, and corn tempura softshell crab, Atla does enchiladas and chilaquiles. So don’t come in here thinking this will be “casual Cosme.”
Also don’t expect that the food will be as good as Cosme’s. At Atla, a few things are great, and most others are simply pleasant. The greats include a crispy fish milanese served with a tangy cucumber sauce, the pambazo sandwich which is mostly bread soaked in chorizo juice, and surprisingly, the avocado toast. The pleasants include an avocado stuffed with arctic char and a guacamole dish that comes with one massive chip. There are also a few things you can pretty much skip: an arctic char tostada that seems like some kind of riff on a bagel and cream cheese, a forgettable quinoa salad, and a coconut yogurt that feels more like a dessert.
On multiple visits, we’ve left Atla unsure of whether we love this place or not. A few dishes are really good, but not on the level that you’re thinking about them days later. We’ve been back at every time of day, and have found when you come makes a big impact. It’s nice at breakfast, but you’ll be missing out on most of the best dishes. Dinner, inconveniently, is our least favorite time to be at Atla - it can feel small and tight in here during peak times. It’s best at weekday lunch, when the light shines in and makes the place super bright, and when you can order the huevos rancheros as well as the whole dinner menu. And yes, we became the kind of people who skip out of work at lunchtime to figure this out."

",2.0,East Williamsburg,Win Son,8.3,"We could complain about the fact that there’s only one bathroom, or we could tell you about the time that it took us a few minutes to get the bartender’s attention. But the bathroom thing seems pretty minor, and we’ve been told by several sources that our faces are actually pretty ignorable. In the end, we have very few bad things to say about Win Son.
The food at this East Williamsburg restaurant is Taiwanese-American. You should know, however, that this doesn’t mean fusion, and that if you want a cheeseburger egg roll, you’re still going to have to go to Applebee’s. This place is owned by two Americans, and what you’ll get is their mostly-faithful take on Taiwanese food. 
They do lu rou fan (minced pork over rice), beef wrapped in scallion pancakes, and a Taiwanese staple known as flys head (equal parts pork and chives). Pretty much everything comes topped with something like scallions or fried shallots, and, as you see each dish come out of the kitchen, you’ll know for certain that you want it to be a part of your life. 
Sure, maybe the zhajiangmian (noodles with fermented bean paste) could use a little more sauce, but you’ll finish the bowl regardless.It’ll be hard not to, seeing as how the food is great, and this is honestly just a pleasant place to have a meal. It’s casual and unpretentious, but you could bring a date here on Saturday night (and chances are they’d be impressed). The dining room itself is a little nicer than the one at your average neighborhood spot, there’s some outdoor seating, and they keep the mostly-hip-hop soundtrack at the exact volume where you can enjoy it but still have a conversation. All in all, this is one of the coolest places where you can eat in your sweats on a Tuesday.
And you should feel free to do so. Win Son is affordable, the service is friendly, and the food is interesting without being too fussy. It isn’t necessarily a place where you’re going to make your friends eat when they’re visiting from out of town, but if you live within, say, a 40-minute commute, it’s one of your best casual-meal options. You can sit, eat some good food (that you maybe haven’t tried before), and not spend a fortune. We not only have no complaints about that - we wish we eating here right now."

",4.0,American,The Grill,9.2,"I don’t smoke. Or at least I don’t anymore. As a matter of fact, I’m the guy that does a disgusted fast walk when someone is in front of me on the street with a butt in their hand.
How dare you pollute my personal ozone of hot garbage smells and bus fumes with your mouth smog? Do you even work out?
That said, there are two things in this world that make me desperately want to smoke a cigarette again: hanging out in Paris, and having dinner at The Grill.
If you happen to be new to the food internet, have better things to do than keep up with daily restaurant news, or were born after 1983, there is some important backstory that you need to know before you read this review. Before The Grill was The Grill, it was a legendary restaurant called the Four Seasons. The Four Seasons opened in 1959 and became famous for many things over the years, such as pioneering the concept of “New American” cuisine, popularizing the idea of seasonal cooking, and being an exemplar of New York extravagance. But the Four Seasons was probably most famous for its powerful clientele. It was a place where heads of state, moguls, icons, and tycoons all came to be seen, cut deals, and maybe even eat some food.
Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, except for The Simpsons, and the Four Seasons closed in July of 2016 amidst a dispute with the owner of the building. To be honest, by that point, the restaurant was probably past its prime. But it certainly marked the end of an era.Now a new era begins, in which the Four Seasons has been brought back to life by Major Food Group, the owners of Carbone and Sadelle’s and other meticulously-crafted experiences masquerading as restaurants. They’ve taken over the entire space, splitting the famous dining rooms into two separate restaurants, and naming them after the colloquial terminology used back in the day to distinguish the two - The Grill (room) and The Pool (room). And they haven’t changed all that much aesthetically, because they can’t. Many elements of the classic Modernist interior are landmarked by the city. Even the curtains.
So, instead, it seems that Major Food Group decided to “Oceans 11” this bitch, which is to say they took the plot of something classic, tweaked the script a little, brought in some new actors, and spent an incredible amount of money on production. The end result is something that’s familiar if you’ve seen the original, but also different. Something that is great in its own right. Something that makes me want to smoke.
Why does The Grill make me want to return to that old bad habit of my youth? Part of it definitely comes from the fact that every element of this place has been designed to transport you back to a time before we had “good science” or a real understanding of “heart disease.” But really, it’s because every meal I have had here has ended with me feeling like some sort of legend from the past. Like a modern day Sammy Davis Jr. in a world full of Don Cheadles. The food is excellent, the service is perfect, and the entire experience is curated from the moment they open the door for you to the moment you leave. The prices? They are ridiculous. But that’s not the point.
The point is that The Grill is a place that gives me that feeling of doing something pleasurable but irresponsible. And I think that’s something we could all use from time to time. Lord knows we are living in a new era. You’re probably gonna need a smoke."

",2.0,Latin,Pokito,7.4,"Pokito is just as much a bar as it is a restaurant. It’s a quirky little spot that feels trendy, but not at all pretentious. It’s also extremely casual, as evidenced by the pulley system they use to get the food from the basement kitchen to the bar (which is where you’ll also place your order). 
For cocktails, you’ll drink something that would fit in way better on a beach than under the Williamsburg bridge (which is essentially where this place is located), and to eat there’s a small but extremely solid menu of Latin-Asian mashups. Our favorite things here are the Coco Bowl (with crispy coconut rice and plantains) and the Green Bowl with added katsu chicken. This is the rare spot that works equally well for kicking off your Saturday night as it does for a Tuesday when you just need something fast, quick, and kind of healthy."

",1.0,Pizza,Scarr’s Pizza,6.3,"It’s your birthday, and a friend gives you a dictionary. What a sh*tty present, you think. But once you get home, you notice that your kitchen table is slanted. So slanted, in fact, that you wedge the dictionary under one of its legs, and voilà. Problem solved. Suddenly, your terrible present is useful. And all you had to do was think of it differently: as a wedge for your table.
That’s how you should approach Scarr’s Pizza. Treat it like a restaurant, and you won’t have the best time. But think of it as a (beer and wine) bar that just happens to serve pizza, and you might enjoy yourself.
Scarr’s is a tiny place on the Lower East Side, and it looks like it’s been around since the 1970’s. There’s a retro sign, a takeout counter, and a wood-paneled dining room with a couple of booths and a linoleum bar. It’s dark and old-school, and it feels sort of like a bowling alley without the lanes. 
But this isn’t average old-school pizza place. First off, people are into it. Like, really into it. Some nights, it feels like a clubhouse for the kids who achieved a measure of coolness during their last year of college and vowed to never lose that feeling.
They also have organic wine, baked clams, and a vegan caesar salad. Which might lead you to believe that this place is similar to a sit-down spot like Rubirosa or Lil Frankies. Thing is, it isn’t. There are only a few tables (that are pretty much always full), you order at the counter, and anything that isn’t a slice of pizza takes about twice as long as it would at any other restaurant.
Which brings us to our next point: don’t get anything but pizza here. If you try to order something else, the person at the counter will seem confused or annoyed or maybe even a little scared (like when Paul Walker misses a shot in Pleasantville and no one wants to touch his basketball). And once you place your order for baked clams or a meatball sub, you might not see your food for another forty minutes. Considering how cramped it gets in here, this isn’t ideal.
So, yes, as a restaurant, this place kind of sucks. As a cross between a dive bar and a slice joint, however, it works just fine. We can’t suggest it for a full meal (unless you come early or on quieter weeknight), but if you want to eat some pizza, drink a beer, and maybe run into someone you made out with once in college, it’s a decent choice. Just know that the music is loud, the service is spotty, and if you’re over the age of 25, you will suddenly become very conscious of the fact that you are over the age of 25."

",3.0,American,Faun,8.1,"When we’re talking to people on our text-based recommendation platform, Text Rex, we hear this line a lot: “I’m looking for a place like [restaurant name] but not [restaurant name]. There are also typically some other qualifiers thrown into the mix. For example, it might go something like: “Hey, what’s a restaurant that’s exactly like Carbone, except not as expensive as Carbone, but still exactly as good as Carbone, that can seat ten of us at 8pm tonight.” Sounds fun, right? It actually is. We’re always up for a good challenge. But sometimes there just isn’t a good answer. 
Then again, sometimes there is. And Faun is a perfect example. 
Faun is a Prospect Heights restaurant brought to you by a former Vinegar Hill House chef, and it’s exactly the restaurant you’d be looking for if you wanted somewhere that’s “like Vinegar Hill House, but not Vinegar Hill House.” The menu is similar, the casual-but-cute atmosphere is familiar, and they even have a pleasant back garden from which to enjoy your Vinegar Hill House-esque food from.To be fair, Faun is more than just a restaurant that will remind you of another restaurant. It’s a place we like very much on its own merit, a high quality neighborhood spot that’s also worth traveling for. It’s also a restaurant that understands that putting pasta on a menu is the same thing as putting Sean Paul on a pop song - instant upgrade. As a matter of fact, much of the Faun menu changes frequently, but the one constant that you can rely on are the pastas. They’re always creative and range from very good to “Gimme The Light.” Lean heavy on that section of the menu. We also like the short but well curated wine list and the friendly service, and the fact that it’s not a tough place to get into.
At least it isn’t yet. But if Faun does end up becoming a tough table to secure, we’ll be ready with some alternative suggestions.

",2.0,Ethiopian,Bunna Cafe,8.2,"Sharing food is often kind of terrible. The best dishes go fast, the prices add up faster, and before you know it someone just ate the last piece of crudo and now you’re unreasonably angry and a little sad. But what if it didn’t have to be like that? What if you could go to a great restaurant, share food with your friends, and actually fill up your stomach without emptying your wallet?
That experience is actually possible in Ethiopian restaurants. And at Bunna, the vegan Ethiopian spot in Bushwick, it’s an especially excellent experience. 
There are several ways to approach a meal at Bunna, but your easiest and best route is The Feast: a giant plate of dishes like Misir Wot (spicy red lentils), Gomen (garlic collard greens), Shiro (gingery split pea curry), and kale salad with avocado (because we’re still in Brooklyn). The Feast isn’t just perfect for sharing - it’s designed for it. You’ll eat nine different things off the same shared plate, plus your own personal pile of injera (flat, spongy sourdough flatbread for scooping) so you don’t have to fight anyone for the last piece. If you want even more food, the appetizers are also great, and you can add extra orders of any of the dishes a la carte.
At Bunna, you get really comfortable really fast - like if you were eating in your own apartment, only while wearing clothes and not sitting too close to the TV.  It’s a warm, welcoming, casual space, consistently packed with people having a great time. There’s a bar, and a decorated area at the center of the room where they do Ethiopian coffee ceremonies (“Bunna” translates to “coffee”) and sometimes host live music. The cocktails aren’t precious (get an Ethiopian-spiced margarita, or go wild with a vegan alcoholic milkshake) and the beer is sorted into categories: Ethiopian, Regular, and Cheap.
Bunna isn’t just affordable (The Feast for two is $30), or accessible - it’s also healthy. But the plant-based food is so satisfying that you’ll probably forget it’s vegan. Until you walk out the door, after eating a ridiculous amount, actually feeling pretty good. And a hell of a lot better than any small plate of crudo would leave you. Even if you got the last bite."

If Motel Morris were a person, it would dress itself in khakis, its favorite band would be Fleet Foxes, and you would talk minimal sh*t behind its back. It’s a safe bet - a good utility spot in Chelsea that’s nice without feeling stuffy. You could take your grandmother here, or you could bring a well-dressed date who works out a lot and might have theories about the illuminati. The space looks great, there are plenty of healthy options, and it isn’t insanely expensive (which you’ll appreciate, once you hear your date’s theories about the illuminati).The food itself is pretty much what you expect from any new American place that worked with an interior designer. They do a whole trout, tuna crudo, roasted chicken, and some vaguely Southern things like collard greens with black eyed peas. It’s a crowd-pleasing lineup. You can get a kale salad, or, if you’d rather be happy, you can eat a burger.
And it won’t be a bad burger. It might not be the best you’ve ever had, but, on the bright side, the dining room looks like a cross between a high-end furniture store and the lobby of a hotel for young business travelers who’ve seen a Wes Anderson film or two. It’s dark blue, the furniture is plausibly Swedish, and the Pepto-Bismol-pink bathrooms bring the whole old-school-motel theme together.Overall, Motel Morris is a safe choice, and your reaction to it will range from lukewarm to enthusiastic, depending on your needs. If you’re looking for a place to get rowdy with friends, this isn’t it. And if you’re looking for a dish so good you’ll need to order seconds, you probably won’t find it here. But if you want a vibey space where you can have some drinks and a solid meal with friends (maybe even at the bar), this place fits the bill. It’s even sort of cool - like a dad in Jordans or a friend whose idea of “going out” is a glass of wine at a nice little spot where, if you need to relieve yourself, you can do so in an all-pink bathroom."

You might have even already quit your terrible job and moved to Bali.
But just in case you haven’t done that last one yet, there’s Selamat Pagi - the closest thing you’ll get to quitting your job and moving to Bali, without actually having to quit your job and move to Bali. 
We ourselves have not quit our jobs and moved to Bali (yet), and it’s fair to say we’re not experts in Balinese food. But Selamat Pagi is Balinese-inspired, and if this food is like what you’d find on that island, we should probably all should start plotting a life change immediately.
The menu here is vegetable-heavy, pretty healthy, and very satisfying. You’ll be familiar with the kinds of things you’ll see on the menu (curries, noodles, fried rice), but Selamat Pagi does them all a bit differently. There’s the pumpkin curry that we could eat every day of the year, a spicy beef rendang (kind of like a stew) with pickled vegetables, and a fish curry in a turmeric broth that’s better than anything sold in latte form at your local Australian coffee shop. The fried rice is really flavorful, and comes with prawn chips for scooping. The papaya salad and shrimp & corn fritters are also great. To put it simply, if you enjoy a spread full of bowls full of colorful, tasty things, you will enjoy the food at Selamat Pagi.This place also feels like walking into a vacation. There’s palm leaf wallpaper, natural wood everywhere, paper lantern lights, and some neon pink signage. But unlike other similarly-designed spots that feel like cheap Instagram bait, you won’t find yourself stressed out at this restaurant. No one is wildly looking around trying to take mental (and iPhone) pictures of everything so they can try to copy it in their own apartment, and no one is talking too loudly about things no one cares about. The overall vibe is extremely low-key, the crowd is all neighborhood people, and it is in no way a production to eat here. 
The only real drawback? Selamat Pagi is in a far corner of deep Greenpoint. But no matter where you stand on your resolutions, you could probably use an escape. And that’s exactly what you’ll get here. No $1500 plane ticket or half-marathon training required."

",3.0,Sushi,Sushi Katsuei,8.4,"Life is full of slippery slopes. You say you’re just going to have one slice of pizza at the company happy hour, but end up shoveling down four. You decide the $7.99 a month Hulu subscription is a good call, but quickly realize you really need to pay up for the $11.99 commercial free version. And you’re gonna need Netflix and Amazon Prime too.  I can personally still hear the terrifying 9th grade “life skills” teacher warning us what would happen to us if we tried pot or went to the unsanctioned homecoming party thrown by the cool seniors. I didn’t take her advice, but still: sometimes it’s OK to get a little scared.
Right now, I’m a little scared of Sushi Katsuei, because this restaurant is basically the gateway drug that could lead down the path to a very expensive sushi habit.
Katsuei started out in Park Slope, and is well-known for its affordable omakase options. They’ve now expanded into Manhattan, taking over a space in the West Village. And on the surface, it seems like your life savings are safe: for $57, you get nine incredibly good pieces of sushi and a handroll. In terms of both quality and variety, it’s probably the best you’ll find in New York City for what you’re paying.
At most sushi places in this range, you’ll get some toro and maybe some uni, but at Katsuei, even the entry level omakase will get you pieces like ocean trout and firefly squid. Plus some damn good toro and uni too. And once you’re exposed to them, you’re going to want more. You’re going to see the person next to you trying seared barracuda and some kind of giant mutant clam and more varieties of tuna, and when the chef asks if you want to try some more pieces, you’re going to say yes. (Speaking of the person next to you, it’s absolutely essential to the experience that you sit at the bar here. If you’re at a table, you won’t get your pieces one by one, and it just won’t be the same.)
If you have the willpower and non-insane hunger levels to stick to the entry-level nine piece and a handroll situation, come to Sushi Katsuei for some of the absolute best, most eye-opening sushi you can get here for the price. Just know that you’re probably going to want more, and that this could quickly turn into a dangerous habit."

",3.0,Italian,Vic’s,7.4,"If you eat at restaurants a lot, you might keep some sort of running list of them. If you eat in restaurants as much as we do, you might keep many lists of them. Or maybe you’re one of those people who just keeps everything saved in your brain like a human hard drive. Want to trade brains?
Our lists range from “New Places To Try ASAP” to “Old Places You Want To Go Back To” to “Places To Go When It Feels Like There Is Nothing Good In The World.” Then there’s the list that Vic’s has a spot on: “Easy Places That Aren’t Bad.” 
It might not be the most exciting category, but back-pocket utility restaurants are important. Vic’s is the sort of spot that saves you when you’ve agreed to meet a friend for dinner somewhere not too far from Union Square, and she suggested The Smith but you’ve been to The Smith way too many times.  Or when you’re meeting an early-in-the-game date and you want a bar move where you could also eat something. Or when you somehow convince yourself to go to a workout class on a Saturday, and want to eat something afterwards without having to change or deal with a two-hour wait. To be clear, this is a place where it’s only borderline acceptable to wear your sweaty tank top, but you can get away with it. Maybe pack an extra layer.
But Vic’s doesn’t just get a spot on our list because of logistics. The Italian-ish food is also solid, from the pastas to the pizzas to the healthier stuff like roasted vegetables and salads. It’s not going to blow minds, but pretty much anyone you bring here will leave happy. They might even put it on their list."

",2.0,Caribbean,Sally Roots,7.7,"You aren’t going to find an Upland in Bushwick, and won’t find a Babbo either. In part, that’s due to demographics. Yes, many families live in the neighborhood (and have for a very long time), but there’s also just a sh*tload of twenty-somethings making synth-pop or performance art or whatever it is you do when you graduate from college and want to prove to your parents that you got poetry in you. And that’s why you’ll find places like Sally Roots here.
On any given night, the median age at this restaurant will be about 24. It’s a neighborhood spot full of neighborhood people, and nothing costs over $20. The food itself is Caribbean/American, and it’s pretty straightforward. Order a bowl of braised oxtail, and that’s what you’ll get - a scoop of meat on a pile rice and peas.Which isn’t to say that you shouldn’t go here. Sure, the plating isn’t fancy, but Sally Roots has other things going for it: it’s well-designed, dimly lit, and they play loud music. This place is perfect for a casual dinner date or a night out with friends, and if you’re one of the seven billion people who enjoy backyards, they have a great one.So when shouldn’t you come here? Maybe when you’re looking for a life-changing meal.
Mostly, this is just food you put in your mouth while you talk to other people. It isn’t fancy, but it makes you feel good, and if you have a bad weekday, the pulled pork will put its arm around you and tell you that things could be worse.
Although don’t expect comforting service. Most employees here give the impression that they just got back from a Father John Misty show, and it totally wiped them out. Your drinks might even sit even sit at the bar while the servers take pictures of each other and field compliments on their hats. But what are you going to do? It’s still a fun place to eat. 
If we lived nearby, we’d come here once a week - selfie-taking servers and all. We might even post up at the bar on a Friday night and have a few cocktails (and tostones) before heading to Three Diamond Door. We probably wouldn’t text home about our meal, but at least we’d be full and have money left for drinks. In Bushwick, that’s important."

",4.0,American,4 Charles Prime Rib,9.1,"Why did you come to New York? Were you chasing a career? Looking to start fresh with a new group of people? Did you want to be exposed to more culture? Were you profoundly affected by the show Friends? 
If you didn’t grow up here, you ostensibly moved to this great city for a reason - and it wasn’t to spend all of your money on rent and Pick A Bagel. If you’re anything like me, you moved here because you want to experience life at full speed. I came to New York because doing exciting things mattered more to me than having a “bedroom” or “livable space.” To live in this city is to have unique experiences every single day. 4 Charles Prime Rib is one of those experiences.Opened by the Chicago restaurateur responsible for Chicago’s most famous burger joint, Au Cheval, 4 Charles is basically a high-level concept restaurant. Imagine the same kind of set dressing and theatrics that you’ll find on display at Carbone, but instead of an old school Italian restaurant, this concept is a boozy steakhouse that you can easily picture someone like Sammy Davis Jr. frequenting in his day. It’s a small, dark place that you go to when you want to eat and drink irresponsibly, at irresponsible times of the evening.
Which brings up a few important points about this restaurant. First of all, it’s impossible to get a prime time reservation here. The space is very small, with no bar area, and they don’t turn tables quickly. That means that the few reservations that are available for normal dinner hours get snatched up quickly when they are released 30 days in advance. It also means that the times that will likely be available to you will be after 10:00pm. Some people see this as a bad thing. We do not. Because you’re not supposed to eat at 4 Charles Prime Rib before 10:00pm.
4 Charles Prime Rib is the kind of restaurant where you eat a hamburger as an appetizer and follow it with 20 ounces of prime rib, a hot bowl of creamed spinach, and about four bourbons. You really think you’re going to do all that at 8:30 and then be up for your hip hop kickboxing class in the morning? Of course you aren’t. So you might as well go all in and experience this place the way it was meant to be experienced - late at night and with reckless intent.
That leads us to the second important thing to know about 4 Charles Prime Rib. If you are trying to keep things healthy or maintain any sort of dietary balance in your life, you are going to have a bad time here. This is not a restaurant that should be frequented more than a few times a year, and it’s certainly not a restaurant to bring a vegetarian to.
But if you’re the kind of person who came to New York to live life at full speed, you’re going to love it here. Good luck finding anything like this anywhere else. And good luck at work tomorrow morning."

",3.0,Italian,Leuca,7.0,"Leuca is a big Italian restaurant, run by a famous chef, located on the ground floor of a very modern Williamsburg hotel that looks a bit like a space station, and you can think about this restaurant in one of two ways. The first way is to think of it as just that: a big Italian restaurant, run by a guy who has a bunch of popular places in Manhattan, in a building that looks like it belongs in Midtown or Chelsea.
If you come into Leuca this way, you’ll end up disappointed. You’ll be disappointed that the food isn’t as good as some of Andrew Carmellini’s other restaurants like Locanda Verde or Lafayette. You might be disappointed to see that this particular strip of Williamsburg is starting to look like a little bit like some grayer version of Miami Beach or Dubai, and that the people who move here after college now are investment bankers who like EDM festivals.
Or, you can look at Leuca a different way: as a totally fine hotel restaurant. The pizzas and salads here are solid, there are big comfortable booths, the servers are nice, the wine list is great, and you can probably get a table for eight later this week. The food won’t blow you away, but it also won’t make you go home angry. If we got invited to a big group dinner here and didn’t come in with any expectations, we’d probably go home not-upset.Of course, we do come in with expectations and the knowledge of so many other good restaurants in the area, so it’s hard to get too excited about Leuca. But it’s hard to get too mad about it either. If you are one of those young investment bankers who likes EDM festivals and lives in a big building on Kent, you can bring your parents here when you can’t get into Lilia. If your boss nicely suggests doing the next team dinner in Brooklyn since the whole team lives there, but you suspect she actually would rather do it on the Upper East Side, you could do worse than Leuca.
It all depends on how you look at it."

",3.0,American,Maison Pickle,6.1,"Have we been too hard on the Upper West Side?
When we say there’s no good food up there besides The Smith, we don’t really mean it. We don’t even like The Smith that much. It’s just a running joke. We’re sorry.
Because now we have Maison Pickle. It’s an uptown restaurant, but one that’s trying to feel “downtown” in a way that reminds us of an uncle who tries to seem younger by selling his house, buying an RV, and road tripping to Burning Man with a ziplock full of molly. It doesn’t quite work, and it all feels a little cheesy.
This place is run by the same people who own the popular Upper West Side restaurant Jacob’s Pickles, and it feels like an Applebee’s by way of the Meatpacking District. It’s fancy and good-looking, and there’s a troubling variety of food.
Here’s a small sample:

Half Pig Head Confit
Bacon Steak
Flounder Rockefeller 

And here’s another:

Shrimp Dumplings
Filet Mignon Au Poivre
Garlic Chile Cucumber

It’s a big menu. Probably too big, because most of the food ends up tasting like the stuff you’d get at a chain restaurant in a mall. Take the chicken and shrimp dish - it comes covered in cheese and creamy sauce, and it tastes like something a 1950′s housewife would make to passive-aggressively inform her husband that she resents him. 
That said, you might find a use for Maison Pickle. Cocktails, maybe. Or when you’re desperately looking for a young, well-dressed crowd north of 72nd Street. Because, at the end of the day, this is one of the few places on the Upper West Side that could almost pass for a “cool” downtown restaurant. It isn’t very cool - but if you know how to order, you might leave here not-unhappy. The French dips aren’t bad. They aren’t worth a trip, but if your uncle is driving his RV into town and wants to hang somewhere lively on the UWS, you guys could split one at the bar. Or maybe just go to The Ribbon."

Turmeric is the new Viagra. Lattes are made with almonds and matcha, not milk and espresso. Porridge is a thing people eat voluntarily. Cauliflower is too expensive because cauliflower lords are taking advantage of the cauliflower-rice boom. Ramps are not things you walk up.
It can seem like every new NYC restaurant is just another brightly-lit pretty-person hangout serving some combination of quinoa, kale, activated charcoal, and nut butters. But then you go to places like Taqueria St. Mark’s on a Saturday night. And it’s absolutely slammed. And you realize, we’re all going to be OK.Taqueria St. Mark’s is a divey, two-floor Mexican bar and restaurant with margaritas and Mexican food so cheap you’ll think you’re suddenly back in your college town. Unless you’ve spent a lot of time in LA - in which case, you might think you’re there. There’s Lakers stuff everywhere, the people are friendly, and the tacos here remind us of the ones you’ll find at dime-a-dozen random solid taco spots across that city. The difference is that this is New York, not LA, and when you find a random solid taco spot where you and all your friends can eat and drink like cauliflower lords for well under $20 a person, it’s actually a pretty big deal. 
The good news: Taqueria St. Mark’s is not alone. It isn’t the only place where you can eat cheap tacos, drink cheap drinks, and have a good time - but it is one of our go-to’s in that category. Climb out of your health hole and come back to the real world. It feels good."

",2.0,Sushi,Sugarfish,8.1,"On the west coast of America, there’s a mysterious city you may have heard of, called Los Angeles. You may know some things about this land’s strange and unusual ways: its citizens own automobiles, and for recreation they enjoy walking up dusty hills with the companionship of a canine. At mealtimes, the residents typically place avocado on top of a bowl filled with other green vegetables, and frequently speak of their fondness for a hamburger restaurant and its “Animal Style” dishes. Whether they actually frequent these “In-N-Out” establishments regularly is uncertain, but mentioning this burger seems to be code for establishing one’s connection to the city. There is another place that restaurant-going Los Angeles residents also speak about frequently, and actually eat in frequently as well. This restaurant is called Sugarfish.
The reason we are taking you on this anthropological journey is that Sugarfish, which is known for its relatively affordable sushi menus, has arrived in New York. Sugarfish’s formula is simple: there are three set “Trust Me” menus, and almost everyone goes off one of these, because they’re a pretty damn good deal. Each of them starts out with edamame and a small cup of tuna sashimi, and then follows with sushi and handrolls - for $27 you’ll get four pieces and one handroll, for $39 you’ll get eight pieces and two handrolls, and for $51 you’ll get 12 pieces and two handrolls. The $27 “Trust Me Lite” is indeed very light for dinner, so we usually go for the $39 regular “Trust Me.” Whichever you opt for, you’ll get high-quality pieces of sushi that lean on the large side, and are made with rice that’s noticeably warm and very vinegary. It’s slightly different from the more delicate sushi you’ll find at top sushi places in New York, but still very satisfying.To answer the inevitable question, it is pretty much exactly the same quality as what you’ll find in LA. It costs slightly more here, but so does your apartment and, well, everything. The setup - a clean, modern room with a closed kitchen rather than a sushi bar - is the same too. The one key difference is that the lines at this New York location are, frankly, f*cking insane. With 10 locations in LA and some of the novelty having worn off, you can get into a West Coast Sugarfish with relative ease. Here, plan to get there before 6pm for dinner, and then expect to wait another hour or so until they text you.
That “Los Angeles” place doesn’t sound so bad, actually."

But there’s a bit of eastward movement as well, mostly in the form of restaurants. First came Sugarfish, the beloved kind-of affordable sushi place, and now we also have its more relaxed younger sibling, KazuNori, which serves exclusively handrolls.
When you walk into this restaurant on 29th Street, you’ll be handed a paper menu and a pencil, and you’ll be instructed to take a seat along the long bar. It’s like a mix of going to a fast casual restaurant, a fancy cocktail bar, and the local middle school where you took your SATs.Once seated with your pencil and paper, you’ll pick which handroll set you want - they come in sets of three to six, with the six topping out at a very affordable $28 including gratuity. Each roll is handed to you freshly made, one at a time, and they’re designed to be eaten immediately for maximum seaweed-crispness. It’s a good deal, and it’s also fast: everyone sits along a bar and you’ll probably be out in under 40 minutes. The quality is good, and it’s a satisfying option for almost-cheap sushi. Hit it early (before 7) to avoid waits.
We’d recommend KazuNori for a quick dinner, not for a date or a night out. It’s a good place to eat solo. Remember, all your friends moved to LA anyway."

",2.0,Italian,LaRina Pastificio & Vino,8.4,"Like sharing, being patient, and not calling someone stupid to their face, compromising is an important life lesson you’re taught from a very young age. And while we’ve never been great at the first three things, compromising is something you have to learn in order to survive New York City. You want a studio with a full kitchen and great natural light that’s larger than a coffin? You better be okay with moving to Rockaway. Looking for a place to get some fresh air on a Saturday afternoon? You’re going to have to share that park bench with at least four other people, one of whom is having a philosophical conversation with an iguana on his shoulder. 
And when it comes to eating out in NYC, you’re also going to have to compromise - your time, your money, and/or your personal space. But not at LaRina. At this neighborhood restaurant in Fort Greene, you don’t just get great pasta, great prices, or a great patio. You get all three of those things in the same restaurant. And the only person having crazy philosophical conversations is you, wondering why dinner can’t always be this easy.LaRina is the second Italian spot from the people behind Aita in Clinton Hill. We like Aita, but LaRina is special. Special in the way that makes you feel - especially when you’re eating and drinking on the magic patio - like you are a lucky person, and that anybody who isn’t here is an unlucky person.
LaRina’s thing is pasta, and you should plan to go big on it. The easiest way to do so is by ordering from the tasting menu, which lets you try three of them for $38. If you’re with one other person, split that, a couple of small plates, and a carafe of wine (after trying one of their many cocktails), and you have a pretty perfect dinner.
Just like rent-controlled apartments and Craigslist roommates, casual dinners often call for compromises. But now that we have LaRina, that won’t be necessary."

Which brings us to the William Vale Hotel. It’s in Williamsburg, but it has a rooftop bar worthy of the Meatpacking District and a ground-level restaurant that looks like it was airlifted in from Nolita (with everyone trapped inside). It’s shiny and massive, and pretty soon all of Brooklyn is going to look like this.
And if that upsets you, there’s really nothing we can do about it. Although there’s something that might take the edge off. It’s in a trailer in a grassy park directly beneath the William Vale, and it comes with an 80’s soundtrack that makes you want to get a perm, put on a leotard, and do some high kicks.
Its name is Mister Dips, and it’s from the same people behind the bar and the restaurant at the William Vale - although it probably cost about half of what those places spent on rugs.Mr. Dips is just an airstream trailer in a park, and they make the sort of food you want to eat outside in summer. Burgers, fries, ice cream - it’s like Shake Shack, but smaller and more fun. They do waffle fries covered in nacho cheese and soft serve dipped in chocolate. And while their burger isn’t quite as good as the one at the Shack, we could still see ourselves choking on one trying to eat it too fast.
More importantly, however, Mr. Dips is a feel-good place. It’s cheap, the staff is friendly, and they only play music that could have plausibly been on the Top Gun soundtrack. It makes you feel like you’re back in middle school and thinking about bleaching your tips but are unsure what emotional impact this will have on your Tamagotchi.
So if you have kids or you want to feel like a kid, stop by. Walk up to the trailer, place your order, then eat some candy-coated ice cream while you stare at the Manhattan skyline. It’s fun and nostalgic, and, if you don’t look back, you might even forget for a second that you’re standing in the shadow of a fancy new hotel that makes your apartment look like Oscar the Grouch’s second-best trash can."

",2.0,Pizza,Ops,8.5,"It doesn’t take much time living in New York City to realize that finding your own version of Cheers or Central Perk or Tom’s Restaurant or Bada Bing isn’t as easy as you might have hoped. The bartender friend who always comps your shots, the coffee guy who can always tell when you’re having a rough morning, or even the bodega cashier who’s memorized your drunk order so all you have to do is hand him your credit card and shamefully avoid eye contact - if you’ve achieved any of these situations, congratulations. You’re officially living out your very own New York City sitcom.
Ops, a restaurant serving great pizza in Bushwick, will make you feel like you’re already a regular from the minute you walk in the door. Even if you don’t live in this neighborhood, we think that feeling’s worth traveling for.
The menu is small (it’s a short list, and also weirdly physically tiny), with only one rotating cheese plate, appetizer, and salad - the rest is all pizza. Which is what you’re really here for. The sourdough crust is great, and if you dabble in square pies, their version is excellent. Meals at Ops are basically just bread and cheese, but we never feel the spiraling regret of a food hangover after eating here. Maybe that’s because they get all their ingredients from local farmers. Or maybe we’ve finally built up full bread and cheese immunity.The wine situation at Ops also adds to the we’re-already-all-friends vibe. There’s no wine list here - instead, they pour different natural wines every night and charge the same price for all of them. Don’t know anything about wine? They’ll let you try stuff until you find one you like. All of which plays into the greater theme at Ops, which is people actually being nice. As in, how people behave in Central Perk, but not so much in real-life NYC. 
As for the space, you couldn’t really think up a more ideal setting to put down roots in a restaurant. There’s brick everywhere, a salvaged wood ceiling that’s cool enough that you actually notice it, a long bar, a tile-covered pizza oven that glitters like Rainbow Fish, and thick red curtains that block out everything you don’t want to be thinking about right now - i.e. anything besides pizza and wine.
So while Ops is perfect for making into your new go-to casual hang, it’s equally great for impressing someone without looking like you’re trying too hard. We also saw a 50s-prom-themed bachelorette pizza party here, so you can do that too. Or just try strolling in on a random free night to eat a pizza by yourself at the bar. No shameful avoidance of eye contact required."

Every time you’ve taken a picture of avocado toast or scrolled through your Instagram feed and liked a photo of a rainbow latte, you made this place more likely. And each time you’ve fantasized about living in a bright Soho loft with a little neon sign that says I love you, you sexy bitch, these people could smell it.
So now we have this. While We Were Young - a tiny spot in the West Village that looks like someone stabbed a Chanel handbag with an ancient dagger and prayed for the most photogenic restaurant in NYC. 
You’ll want to take a picture of this place. It’s inevitable. So just get it over with. Take some pictures of the cursive neon sign, the pink velour banquette, and the baby-blue bar stools. And don’t forget the rose petals. There’s one on every coaster and enough beside the bathroom sink to go back in time and invite at least three people to prom.But after the pictures are done, what’s next? Here you are, trapped in a rose-gold iPhone’s daydream, and you’re starting to feel claustrophobic. And nothing, not even an acoustic cover of Fetty Wap’s “Trap Queen” (soothing as it is) can make you want to spend more than ten minutes here.
The friendly service helps (but not enough), and, on a quiet night, you could plausibly enjoy a cocktail here - but this place is pretty much always packed. And if you’ve been to Cha Cha Matcha or Le Bain, you’ll recognize the crowd.
As for the food, there’s really nothing we can endorse. That includes the chicken and waffles. Maybe you’ve seen them on Instagram. The waffles are green (from kale), but this is just a stunt. Like when you throw a few chia seeds in a smoothie or put a Tolstoy novel on your bookshelf to make people think you have layers. In the end, the waffles are just kind-of-dry waffles. The chicken itself isn’t bad - but hard pass on the tuna tartare. That’s Instagram bait.
But if that’s what you’re after, come here. Take some pictures, pick at your food, then head home and think about your life choices. For everyone else, Bar Sardine is only a few feet away. It’s about the same size, but the food there is different - it’s the kind you want to finish."

Ikinari is a chain from Japan, and they’re known for their affordable steak. They do a few different cuts (priced by the ounce), and, whatever you get, it’ll be significantly cheaper than the stuff at your average steakhouse. Walk up to a counter, choose your meat (and how much you want), and it’ll get delivered to your table on a hot slab of cast iron. And if you’re afraid this is some kind of inferior discount steak, it isn’t. This is quality stuff. So what’s the catch?
Glad you asked. They don’t have chairs. That’s why you won’t be bringing any dates here. You eat your meal standing, and that’s how Ikinari keeps prices down. People don’t hang out as long when there’s nowhere to sit. And more customers going in and out = cheaper steaks.
So if you just went to the gym and you want to eat a quick, relatively inexpensive steak, or if you’re really trying to mix things up, check out Ikinari. It’s a fun experience, the steak is great, and they’d get a much higher rating if you didn’t have to eat off a table that feels like a station at a bank where you fill out a deposit slip. But for the 1% of the time you don’t mind standing while you put beef in your mouth, it’s perfect."

When we first reviewed this restaurant, we were riding high on L’Artusi, our favorite West Village Italian place that also happens to be around the corner. Our feeling on I Sodi was that it could never compete. A few years later, L’Artusi is still our favorite legal drug. But I Sodi no longer needs to compete - it’s something different entirely. 
I Sodi is a single, narrow room with white tablecloths, servers wearing ties, maybe eight tables, and a bar that takes up half of the space. It feels upscale, but it’s not trying too hard. The good energy in the room comes from people who are enjoying their dinner - not from hip lighting fixtures or hanging plants or dusty shades of pink. Everyone is here for the food. 
And that food is straightforward, classic Italian. Dishes so simple you’re confused when they end up tasting this good. Stuff like artichoke salad with only olive oil and parmesan, spaghetti cacio e pepe, and lasagna. Granted, that lasagna is 20 layers or something ridiculous like that, but it’s still just meat lasagna - the best we’ve ever had. If the default place you go to in your mind is your future retirement estate in Tuscany - or really anywhere it would be acceptable to live on a diet of pasta alone - you will like I Sodi.You’ll also like I Sodi because you’ll be comfortable here. It’s a small space that’s always packed, but never feels like a sh*tshow. (They’ve even built a walled-off vestibule to put the hangry waiting people, so you can enjoy your ravioli in peace.) The waitstaff makes sure you’re never without a drink, and when you’re ready for another round you have a seven-item negroni menu and lots of Italian reds to choose from. One visit here and you’ll understand why everyone around you seems to be a regular.
If L’Artusi is the perfect modern Italian place (and it is), then I Sodi is its traditional counterpart. The former is where you take the person you think you might want to marry - and I Sodi is where you take the parents of the person you think you might want to marry. After which point you can move onto your next major life step: retirement real estate in Tuscany."

I walked past this generic-looking corner pub that I was sure I’d never go to again and thought, perfect. 
I expected the crowd of regulars and the TVs on the walls, but what I did not expect was an absolutely killer burger. Massive, messy, two-layered, and topped with cheese, arugula, and probably too many caramelized onions, The Brew Inn’s burger is the platonic ideal of what you want to eat while dining solo.

And if you’re not alone? As long as you’re with people who won’t judge you for what you look like when eating this thing, The Brew Inn also works for a casual group eating/drinking situation. Maybe you’ll even meet someone who you can talk about the way we talk about this burger."

",3.0,Latin,Lalito,8.0,"For many years before Lalito took over 104 Bayard Street in Chinatown, the space was a karaoke dive bar called Winnie’s. It was one medium-sized room, with a stage at the front. To select a song, you’d write it down on a scrap of paper with a tiny golf pencil, and hand it to the bartender along with $1. They’d then play the song on a laserdisc, with the requisite ridiculous karaoke background video playing. The bar was always serving flaming shots, and the crowd was always varied and random in the best way. Once, I left my credit card there and came back at 4pm the next day to see the bar’s staff taking shots of what appeared to be Courvoisier. It was the kind of place that made you think, “Yes, this is why I live in New York.”
In other words, Lalito had big shoes to fill. Run by the chef who previously operated the Lower East Side coffee shop El Rey and turned it into a cool spot for dinner (no longer the case, BTW), Lalito is a trendy, vaguely Mexican restaurant serving everything from pork carnitas to a vegan caesar salad. There are also “vegan chicharrones” (surprisingly good and interesting) and chorizo-stuffed squid and at lunchtime, a “Mexican doner.” You could maybe call it “California-influenced” but they also purposely excluded any form of avocado from the menu, just so you know Lalito isn’t like all the other kids at school.And that’s a good way to describe Lalito overall: it’s original. The space (yellow walls and yellow booths at an old bar in Chinatown) and the food (Mexican-ish, but dishes you’ve never seen before, a bunch of it vegan) are definitely different from anything else out there. You’ll have a fun time here, and you’ll eat some tasty food along with it. We like it for a date or casual dinner, but you should also keep it in mind for brunch or weekday lunch, especially if you’re ever on jury duty. It’s around the corner from the courthouses, so when you next end up on jury duty with an hour lunch break, Lalito is absolutely where you should spend it.
You won’t be belting out “Sweet Caroline” and following it with a flaming sambuca shot here, but this place is an original, and in a different way, it’s still the kind of place that’ll make you happy you live here."

",2.0,Japanese,Cocoron,8.4,"Cocoron is, in our (very correct opinion), one of the most underrated restaurants in New York City. For years, we’ve practically been officially spokespeople for their Mera Mera Dipping Soba - you can read our review for all the details.
They have a new location just a few blocks over on Delancey. It’s pretty much the exact same as the Kenmare one (which is still open as well), but in a slightly bigger space. It's not quite as homey and cozy as the Nolita location, but the food is exactly the same, so if you are coming from slightly further east, or encounter a wait in Nolita, walk across Bowery for another place to get your soba on. For something different, try the yuba dipping soba - it’s not always available at the other location and is a lighter alternative to the legendary Mera Mera."

Is this person going to think I have bad taste for really enjoying that incredibly corny romantic comedy? Are we going to have an awkward subway ride home if I say I didn’t really like that movie everyone else on Earth thought was excellent? Should I just flip it and ask them what they thought first?
You won’t have this moment walking out of Hanoi House. You might not run into the street and scream, “That was the best meal of my life!” but assuming you like good, casual restaurants with interesting food, we’re quite confident you’ll walk out of here able to say you thoroughly enjoyed your meal.Hanoi House is a relatively small restaurant in the East Village, and they serve Vietnamese food. A few of the dishes are modern riffs (there’s an uni banh mi), but our favorite things to order are things like summer rolls better than any we’ve had in New York before, and a truly excellent bowl of pho. In the world of Hanoi-House-as-movie, that pho is most definitely getting a Best Actor nomination. At $13, there are many less expensive bowls around town, but few, if any, that are as good. That’s true of Hanoi House overall - you’ll pay a little more, but everything’s still reasonable, and all of it’s going to be better

",3.0,American,Sunday in Brooklyn,7.8,"You can imagine the meetings that produced Sunday in Brooklyn. The team sitting around a table doing word maps about the kind of people they hoped would eat here. We can see them coming up with marketing archetypes like “Anton” and “Liza,” Williamsburg/Bushwick/Greenpoint people who wear big floppy hats inside, have part-time jobs as models for a cruelty-free leather clog company, and frequent warehouse parties that don’t start until 5am. 
I mean, these people named their restaurant Sunday in Brooklyn.
But despite its name, and a space that feels like an amalgamation of every aspirational interior you’ve ever seen on Instagram, Sunday In Brooklyn actually isn’t as ridiculous as you might think. Sure, it feels like a place that people named Anton and Liza would hang out. But, judging by the crowd of people that also includes plenty of Courtneys and Kevins, Sunday in Brooklyn is a place pretty much anyone would want to hang out. 
It’s a great space, with exposed beams, a wood burning oven, and a big, nice bar. There’s lots of natural light during the day, white marble tabletops, and flowery china that looks like it came from a garage sale upstate. All of these things - plus a killer playlist and very friendly, unpretentious staff - make Sunday in Brooklyn an enjoyable place for brunch and dinner. Even if you’re here on a Wednesday.It’s the kind of place where people would go even if the food was hot garbage. Good news: it’s not. Sunday In Brooklyn does a great brunch, serving grain bowls and matcha lattes for those who just went to their hot yoga studio that’s morally opposed to showers, and patty melts and Bloody Marys for those who did too good of a job reenacting their college glory days last night. Dinner is more limited - your choices are a somewhat forgettable chicken or steak or some much weirder, much better stuff like pastrami-cured cod and sea trout in potato broth and hot buns stuffed with oyster cream. 
Sunday in Brooklyn is a better brunch spot than it is a dinner restaurant, but it doesn’t really matter. The reason that real people are at Sunday in Brooklyn is the vibes. (Which are only going to get better when the rooftop opens.) 
If you live in the neighborhood, this will probably make its way into your rotation, and if you don’t, it could be worthy of a trip - depending on your own priorities. We don’t know if you’re an Anton or a Liza, so you’ll just have to decide those for yourself."

",3.0,Japanese,Karasu,8.2,"Secret bars are the oldest trick in the New York City book. From prohibition to PDT, we’ve been hiding booze behind trap doors and payphone booths for nearly a century. And yet somehow, every time another “secret” bar or restaurant opens, we still get excited like nobody has done it before. “Did you hear about that new bar? It’s in the back of a hair salon and you have to get a manicure before they will let you in. Even dudes. It’s lit.”
That’s the thing about these “hidden” places - usually the fact that you can’t see them from the street is the most interesting thing about them. So often you walk inside feeling excited that you gained access, only to find yet another prohibition-style bartender in a vest slowly muddling some basil. I’m not sure this city needs any more of those.What we do need more of are places like Karasu. Karasu isn’t exactly a “hidden” restaurant, though it is situated in the back of Walter’s in Fort Greene. And it’s most definitely not a speakeasy - or at least the kind of speakeasy that you’re imagining. Karasu is a cocktail-focused Japanese izakaya, with extremely unique drinks and very good food. You don’t knock on any fake doors or turn a giant bookshelf to get in, you don’t need a secret phone number, nor will you be asked to provide character references in order to get in. All you need is a friend or a date, a free evening in Fort Greene, and probably a reservation if you’re looking to go during prime hours.That’s the thing we love about Karasu - the lack of pretense. It’s interesting but not annoying, relaxed but extremely well put together. The drinks are completely unfamiliar and extremely good, and the menu is mostly familiar and exactly what you’ll want to eat after (or with) a few cocktails. It’s the perfect place for a first date when you don’t want to commit to a meal out of the gate, but also don’t want to go to a wine bar because it’ll tip the other person off to the fact that you spend more time in pajamas than you do real pants.
But best of all, Karasu will actually surprise you. My favorite drink here has bourbon, cold brew, and “creme de banana” in it, three words that when put together make my throat want to close up. But you know what? It tastes like the best old fashioned I’ve ever had and not even a little bit like an allergic reaction to breakfast. That’s the kind of trick we’ll always be impressed with."

The internet doesn’t exist in this hypothetical universe, so you can’t Google any recipes. You don’t even know what the word “Google” means. You’ve never heard it before. “What is internet?” you wonder, receiving vague memories from a distant, less hypothetical universe.
So, anyways, you check your fridge, see what you have to work with, then make yourself a meal. Your food doesn’t have a name like “cacio e pepe” or “duck l’orange,” but it’s still good, and you’re full afterwards. That’s kind of what it’s like to eat at Hart’s.
The menu here changes daily, and all of the food feels more-or-less homemade. It’s a little fancy, sure, but it’s not like they’re messing with truffles or caviar. They make things like “sweet potatoes and scallions with tahini” and ribs on a pile of polenta. The dishes aren’t elaborate things constructed with tweezers, but they’re satisfying. Take the clam toast. It’s sort of like if someone made a clam soup, threw in some toast, then dumped it on your plate and said, “There, clam toast.” It’s popular at Hart’s, and we’re fans.Although you should know that the toast isn’t especially healthy. That goes for pretty much everything here. No one is losing weight at Hart’s. The food isn’t in-your-face unhealthy, but your blood-olive-oil content is going to spike.
You should also know that Hart’s is tiny, and that the date-night vibes are pretty ideal. The ceilings are high, there’s a candle on every table, and they play the right version of “Shake it Off” (the Mariah Carey one). So the next time you want to impress someone, bring them here. Alternately, come here, take some notes, and make a nice dinner for someone based off those notes."

",3.0,American,Loring Place,8.1,"If you’ve ever eaten at the Cheesecake Factory, you might remember the fried avocado egg rolls. You probably remember the red velvet cheesecake. But you definitely remember the menu.
200+ items long and laminated like your Great Aunt Mary in Boca’s couch cushions, the Cheesecake Factory menu is - especially when you’re under the age of 15 - a sight to behold. Few things are more thrilling than knowing you could have literally any type of 3,000-calorie meal at your fingertips. 
Why are we still talking about the Cheesecake Factory? Because while the meals here might not be 3,000 calories, Loring Place is great for the same reason: options. Lots of options.
Filled with people who have most likely never stepped foot in a Cheesecake Factory, Loring Place is a kind of fancy Greenwich Village restaurant owned by the chef who once made vegetables a very big deal at ABC Kitchen. Which means, unsurprisingly, there are a lot of vegetables here, too. But there are also many other things - not quite 200 of them, but a long menu’s worth of them, running the spectrum from very healthy to a bacon cheeseburger.
Whether you’re looking to eat just vegetables, or pizza and pasta, or grilled fish and duck, or fried chicken, or that burger, you can order with confidence at Loring Place. Everything is good. Several things are excellent. It’s not going to rock your world, but you’ll go home happy.Loring Place already feels like an old reliable, and not just because of the food - it’s also run like a well-oiled machine. The design is simple but attractive. The food comes out quickly. There’s a killer private dining room. The servers wear crisp white shirts and chambray aprons, and while they’re extremely nice, you also get the sense that they’ve undergone a Marines-level of training. It’s a little loud, but judging by the crowds - from a couple on their 17th wedding anniversary, to women in leather pants annoyed to be waiting for a table, to a group of cool grandparents in from Westchester - people don’t seem to care.
With a lot of new restaurants, you often feel the need to get there as fast as possible. Maybe because you think you’ll see Gwyneth Paltrow, or because you’ve been told they might stop serving their chickpea-water-cocktail or their “bloody” beet burger. Loring Place isn’t like that. It’s simply the kind of consistent restaurant you can bank on for your next girls' night out, or a birthday dinner for your mom (if she has good hearing), or a date night when you want to feel kind of healthy. The Cheesecake Factory isn’t going anywhere anytime soon - and neither is Loring Place."

",2.0,Japanese,ROKC,7.9,"Here’s our general feeling about cocktails: We like to drink them. But we don’t usually have much more to say.
In the good cases, a restaurant makes some very nice cocktails that we will enjoy happily. We might even say, “This is good! The drinks are good here!” In the less-good cases, the drinks come out cloyingly sweet and we’ll wish we had just ordered a shot of grain liquor, or at least an Old Fashioned. Either way, it’s rare that we really talk all that much about cocktails, more than just in passing. And in Infatuation history, we can’t recall ever sending you to a restaurant just because of the drinks.
But here we are, telling you to go to 141st Street primarily to drink booze out of a conch shell.
ROKC stands for Ramen, Oysters, Kitchen, and Cocktails, but it should probably be renamed CROK, because the cocktails are what make this restaurant a destination. The ramen, oysters, and pork buns (the highlight of the “kitchen” menu) are all solid and enjoyable, though it’s the cocktails you’ll go home talking about.Most notably, they’re completely ridiculous-looking. The 40 drinks on the menu come in vessels including but not limited to: a light bulb, an eggshell in some kind of bird’s nest, and a hollowed-out green pepper. Someone next to us got one that came with incense, which was lit at the table. The menu doesn’t indicate what kind of container your drink will come in, and some of them are really just nice-looking fancy glasses rather than contemporary art projects, but that just means you’ll need to keep ordering more rounds until you get that one topped with a miniature scene of people gardening.
The whole thing could be corny, but it’s done extremely well here: the environment is casual and relaxed, and no one’s taking anything too seriously. Also, the drinks really do taste good, and different - they’re truly unlike any cocktails we’ve had elsewhere. This place makes for a great date spot, though do expect to wait on a weekend night.
Now that we’ve spent several paragraphs uncharacteristically talking about cocktails, if you’ll excuse us, we’re going to do that thing we do all the time: drink some."

",3.0,American,Yves,6.5,"You’re on a date, and it’s going well. Your date has good manners, they make the right amount of eye contact, and you could see yourself waking up next to them without instinctively looking for your shoes. 
Then they give you an unabridged history of their love life. Which sucks, because it all started so well.
That’s what it’s like to have a meal at Yves. 
When you walk in here, everything feels right. The little dining room looks like something you’d find in a hip Swedish resort town - it’s painted white, dimly lit, and the soundtrack is somewhere south of mainstream. (Think instrumental surf rock and old-school R&B.) This is somewhere you want to have dinner. Actually, it’s somewhere we want to have dinner. We’d eat here tonight. If the food was better.
We aren’t saying everything is bad. Mostly, it’s just confusing. It reminds us of puberty or America circa 1776 - a lot of great stuff is happening, but some things just aren’t cool. 
Take the gnocchi. It has bacon, clams, and celery, and it gave us a Shark-Tank-worthy idea for a new men’s fragrance. But the sauce is kind of thin and it comes with stale crackers. Then there’s the octopus. It’s perfectly cooked, but it’s also served on a giant half-circle of squid-ink aioli that doesn’t really taste like anything. It looks great, sure, but we don’t like being served food that we aren’t going to eat. Even if it's just aioli. It’s confusing for us, emotionally.
The veal schnitzel, however, is excellent. It comes with a poached egg and a green sauce you’ll want to rub into your gums. It’s also one of the few dishes that tastes as good as it looks.And that’s a real problem here. The food is photogenic, but some plates come with one or two things that seem like they shouldn't be there. Like they were made for a prop dish, and someone in the kitchen got confused.
That, and it’s pricey. Most entrees cost more than $30, and starters range from $15-$20. And sure, it’s not like you’re going to save money by going across the street to Locanda Verde, but at least you know what you're getting there.
That said, we really wanted to like Yves. We feel good here, and we thought maybe we had a future together. One filled with instrumental surf music and schnitzel, and wonderful new colognes based on pork and shellfish. Then we ate more, and things didn’t really work out. It still might be good for a drink at the bar (and maybe even lunch or brunch), but dinner won't live up to your first impression of this place."

You’ve looked in all the spots they should be, you’ve looked in all the spots they shouldn’t be, and you have no idea how you could lose anything in an apartment that only takes you five seconds to cross. Then, after 25 minutes of confusion and expletives, you find them. They were sitting on the counter under a balled-up paper towel that you keep reusing because you finished the roll two days ago. You’d definitely already checked there twice. They just appeared out of nowhere.
Which is exactly how we feel about El Almacén. It’s the kind of satisfying, affordable, quality restaurant we’re always looking for and rarely find. And it’s been right under (or on top of) the balled-up grossness that is the Bedford L stop this entire time. Well, since 2009 to be exact. Back when the Bedford L stop was edgy, this place seems to have been pretty cool. Or at least cool enough that Madonna ate there once. 
Fast-forward to present day and Madonna is definitely not eating El Almacén. But we are, and we’re bringing our friends. Because in this particular deadzone of Williamsburg, this casual Argentinian place actually feels exciting. Not because it’s super trendy, but because there are avocado fries, there’s a giant $24 steak, and there’s zero pretension.Now that you know where to look, you’ll find El Almacén hiding up a flight of stairs. Don’t be scared off by the lace curtains - what’s behind them is a red-brick covered space that feels like the sort of cozy spot you’d stumble into on a random side street in Buenos Aires. Or at least, what we imagine that would be like. And whether you’re hitting it for a low-key weeknight date or a Saturday night with your crew, you’ll want to hang out here. I’m even considering it for my next birthday dinner. And I don’t f*ck around with birthdays.
As for the food, will it blow your mind? Probably not, but that’s also not the point. The point is that you can walk right into El Almacén pretty much anytime, have any kind of meal you want, and walk out happy. That $24 steak isn’t just extremely affordable, it’s extremely good. As are the hamachi crudo and fish tacos, paella and short ribs, empanadas and enchiladas, churros and chocolate lava cake. And that’s just dinner. 
So the next time you get quoted a four-hour wait at St. Anselm for that now-overpriced butcher steak, come to El Almacén instead. Actually, just come here first. You always find your keys - but you don’t always find a restaurant like this one."

If you know Keith McNally restaurants, you know Augustine. It's another in a series of extremely successful restaurants by the restauranteur who made his name on selling steak tartare under warm lights and antiqued mirrors - a cool French brasserie in every sense, except only if you consider hanging out in a room full of people wearing Brooks Brothers ""cool.""
But Augustine is right in the middle of a neighborhood that could desperately use some more cool, even if it is the ""Mom went shopping at Opening Ceremony"" kind. One of two restaurants in the beautiful Beekman Hotel, this is a badly needed upgrade over Bobby Van's and The Capital Grille, or whatever other terrible place you had to have a client meeting in because you were trapped in this part of town. It's even worth considering if you're looking for a spot for Date Night downtown but you're tired of Freemans and scared of the people at Le Turtle. The energy in the room is great, the menu is large and varied, and the food is mostly excellent.
There are, however, some drawbacks. The Beekman Hotel has become such a FiDi destination that Augustine is almost always packed full of people. The room itself, grand and spacious when empty, starts to feel extremely cramped when seated to capacity and full of people drinking at the bar. Tables for two are uncomfortable. And the food - as good as it may be - is also really heavy. This is not a place for a light meal before you go jogging.
Then again, if you're a banker who works in this area, any drawbacks Augustine may have are immaterial. This is a great new restaurant for the FiDi area. And you're too busy closing deals to go jogging anyway."

You need to eat something fast, and preferably something that won’t undo your gym success. At the same time, the idea of eating a salad from a chain makes you want to shove some French fries in your mouth as quickly as possible.
If you live in Park Slope, you have a place that was designed to save you in this situation, and its name is Purbird. The thing here is organic grilled chicken, and it’s excellent. You can get it as a half or whole bird (with a variety of homemade sauces), on top of simple salads, inside wraps and on sandwiches, or in the form of unbelievably good chicken noodle soup. And you can also get it with a variety of sides, which are maybe even better than the chicken itself - particularly the mac and cheese, which is a top contender for our favorite in the city. Is it healthy? Absolutely not. Pick your battles.
To be clear, the gym is not a prerequisite for eating at Purbird. It works just as well as a quick pick-up on your way from the subway to your house, and they also deliver. The space is no-frills, but would also be perfectly fine for a super casual one-on-one meal - particularly when it’s warm and you can sit at one of the picnic tables outside.

It’s the opposite: a never-too-crowded neighborhood place that serves the kind of crowd-pleasing food you would be happy to eat multiple times a week. Pastas? Check. A burger? Yep. Roast chicken, and a kale salad that actually tastes better than one you could make for yourself at home? You get the idea. Plus, the warm dinner bread comes in a little flower pot that you would have to be dead inside not to like. And while the framework of the menu is always the same, the individual dishes change with the seasons. So when you move here and inevitably become a regular at Anella, you also won’t get bored.
Even if you don’t find yourself in the neighborhood very often, you should still make a mental note about Anella for one key situation: outdoor brunch. They have a great back patio, and you can usually get a spot on it without too much of a wait. Just don’t tell too many people and ruin it for the regulars."

",4.0,American,Union Square Cafe,9.2,"This review will not be a lengthy comparison to the original Union Square Cafe. That place is gone forever, and though much has been retained for the new Union Square Cafe, drawing direct parallels between the two will only lead to frustration. Plus, I’m very bad at drawing.
We will say that, as fans of the first incarnation of this restaurant, we are pleased that this new location, just a few blocks over at 19th and Park, still feels a bit like the original Union Square Cafe. A few of the menu items have transferred over, some of the art on the walls is familiar, and the kitchen is still run by the chef who has been overseeing things since 2007.
And that’s where we’re going to leave it. The reality is, as time goes on, less and less of you will have experienced the original, and references to the past will do you no service. Also, nostalgia is for the weak.The good news is that the new Union Square Cafe is incredible on its own. It’s a master class in Danny Meyer restaurant operation, with perfect service and the kind of attention to detail that will impress you but also remind you that you’ve never been good at anything. The room is big and beautiful, the wine list is varied and full of great values, and the food ranges from “pretty damn good” to “did you just put a bowl of pasta in your purse?”
The vibe is both formal and just the right amount of informal, like sitting down in a restaurant you’ve been in a hundred times before, even if it’s your first time. Yes, it’s expensive, and yes, it will be full of a bunch of people wearing suits. But as much as Union Square Cafe is a special occasion restaurant, it’s also great for simply having a good time with some good friends over too much wine. We also love hitting it for a burger and beer during lunch, and if you really want the baller move, swing by the bar for dessert after a more casual date night nearby.
That said, whatever you want to use Union Square Cafe for, have a strategy. Reservations are extremely hard to come by, and while we’ve had some success with the early walk-in, it’s never an easy proposition. The restaurant does have two large bars that you can put your name in for and have a drink or three while you wait - something that wouldn’t have been practical in the original location.
Moral of the story? Change doesn’t have to be scary. At least when it comes to restaurants. Now if you’ll excuse us, we’ll be outside enjoying a 60º day in February."

This restaurant does Thai, Malaysian, and Singaporean food, and we recommend trying something from one of the latter two groups. Get the laksa - it's like if curry and ramen had a child, and it’s one of the great soups of the world. Or go with the rendang curry. Overall, Laut is about one step above the place where you get your weekly Thai delivery. It isn't mind-blowing, but if you're in the area craving Thai (or Malaysian), stop on in."

",2.0,American,Mayfield,8.1,"There’s a reason why The Smith has so many locations. Anyone will find something to eat there, and you can spend a lot or have a burger. Or a salad. You get what we’re saying.
But there’s also a reason we have mixed feelings about that place. It’s useful, but it has about as much personality as a person who writes “have a good summer"" in your high school yearbook.
Enter Mayfield. Like The Smith, its menu is diverse. There are sandwiches, salads, and fish & chips - but there's also a pork chop on polenta, steak tartare, and oysters. Here, you choose how much you want to spend. On a street with a million other restaurants, that’s what makes this a Crown Heights staple.
That and the dining room. It’s dark, with lots of wood and brick. Take a date here. Or bring some friends. This place is casual - so casual that no one seems to be wearing a uniform. Maybe that’s why the employees are so nice. They even smile when you walk in. And since they aren’t wearing a uniform, the love doesn’t feel fake. Drake would like this place.As for the food, it’s good and occasionally great. The burger is like something you’d make on a grill in your backyard if you were better at grilling and you had a backyard, and the fried chicken sandwich is something we’d eat several times a week. It’s somehow light, and the slaw gives it a good crunch. One thing you can skip, however, is the buttermilk fried quail. It’s dainty. Like a low-calorie beer or some radio edit hip hop. We’d like to see how they’d fry a chicken.
The quail is forgiven, however, because unlike The Smith, this place has a beating heart. When you walk inside, you see people from the neighborhood. You see a table of women having a girls night out and an attractive couple holding hands in the corner, completely unaware of how dumb and cliche they look. Or maybe you'll see a few older people having a nice, quiet dinner now that their children are safely making poor decisions at college. And everyone is having a good time. Including the staff (or at least they’re good at pretending). Come here and get something with fries. Or, if it’s a weekend, splurge on some steak tartare or chicken liver mousse. This is a feel-good place, and you’ll feel just fine when you get the check."

",3.0,Chinese,Chinese Tuxedo,6.8,"Being a location scout seems like a fun job. As far as I can tell, your life entails knowing about assorted cool random old-timey theaters and scary-looking alleyways, but also sometimes convincing penthouse-dwelling people they should take money to let an actor shoot a movie in their penthouse.
Why are we telling you this? Well, first of all to tell you that Chinese Tuxedo would be a great place to film a certain kind of movie. It's also a nice way of getting to our main point, which is: we like things about this restaurant (the space in particular), but it's not a home run.
Located in an old opera house on Doyers Street in Chinatown, Chinese Tuxedo is a big space with unfinished concrete walls, a lot of plants, and a generally club-ish feeling room. It looks like the kind of place you'd see in some HBO version of 21st century New York, but which you don't actually end up at all too often unless you're a model or magazine editor. The whole windy alleyway of Doyers Street, actually, feels like it was made for a movie set version of New York: right next to Chinese Tuxedo is Apotheke, a ""speakeasy"" with an old European pharmacy theme that people line up for on weekend nights, and next to that is Nom Wah Tea Parlor, a dim sum place dating back to 1920 that people line up for on weekends during the daytime. Chinese Tuxedo could feel a little like it was trying too hard, but actually, the service is friendly and welcoming, and it's a good, unpretentious time here.The food, which is a modern take on Chinese, is what we haven't been totally amped about on our visits. Almost everything is tasty, but lacks that f*ck yes factor that makes us truly excited about our favorite restaurants. Things also get pricey, and not just in comparison to the excellent but cheap food you can get throughout Chinatown - a few orders of $20+ noodle dishes and $30+ entrees mean it's easy to have one of those nights where you're not sure how you ended up with an $85 per person check.
Chinese Tuxedo might be a fun suggestion for a group that's looking for a party-time dinner, without the terrible-ness of the places you might end up at in Meatpacking or the Lower East Side for such an affair (though it's worth noting they don't have a license for hard liquor yet). We just wouldn't tell you coming out of your way here was a total must. Unless you're a location scout."

But here's the truth: Vanessa's Dumplings is kind of bad. They're not bad, say if you're at a strip mall in Connecticut. But they're thick and often greasy, and more importantly, all you need to do is walk about 20 steps to have what might be the best dumplings in Manhattan.
On the corner of Broome and Eldridge, about a quarter block up from Vanessa's, is Shu Jiao Fu Zhou, a spot you could easily walk by without noticing - no less going in. Don't make that mistake.
For $2, you can get 6 perfectly steamed, smooth, truly delightful dumplings with a pork filling that is almost sweet. They don't come fried, and if you can't deal with that, you don't really deserve to be here anyway. For $3, you can have 10, and for an extra $2, you should add on a plate of their also delicious wheat noodles with peanut butter sauce.

That sentence may either delight you or terrify you. It also may surprise you, considering this is a review of a high end, expensive sushi restaurant. Honestly, it surprised us too, though once it was followed by shots of sake sent down by some dudes down the bar (they had a big bottle) and another round offered up by the manager on our way out, it seemed only fitting. At that point, I believe a Flo Rida song was on full blast.
Since it opened, Sushi Dojo has been known as a fun, somewhat lighthearted option on the high end sushi scene, especially compared to its generally temple-like, quiet, serious counterparts. And after checking in again after a few years, that is truer than ever. At least on a Saturday night, expect to possibly hear 2010-era club bangers.
The sushi here remains very, very good. You’ll get some straightforward fresh fish, but in fitting with the party-time theme, also expect pieces topped with foie gras and things like sea urchin rolled up in seared toro. You might even come across a gold leaf. At the bar, you’re locked into the $90, 15-piece omakase (or a more expensive sushi and sashimi combo), and that’s the way to go if you can swing it, but at tables you can go a la carte or get a $60, 10-piece option.
There are very few places offering an omakase this good for under $100, so Dojo gets serious points for that. Deciding whether it's for you just depends whether you prefer to keep your fancy sushi experiences more zen, or if you aren't mad at the idea of your toro with a side of ""Smack That"" in the company of some mid-level investment bankers."

",1.0,Tex-Mex,Avenida Cantina,1.7,"Maybe it’s not their fault. 
Maybe Avenida Cantina’s chef had a vision that the future of quesadillas is to make them without cheese. Maybe they saw a documentary about how spicy food kills coral reefs and thought they'd do their part by leaving heat entirely out of everything on Avenida Cantina’s menu.
But at a certain point, you run out of excuses. Especially if you’re someone like me who grew up in Texas. And that point came at Avenida Cantina when I discovered that my “enchilada” was sitting atop a hidden lagoon of what we could only assume (and hope) to be watery sour cream. 
Also inexcusable: the rest of the bad food, the terrible service, and the fact that any innocent person who eats here could possibly walk away with the notion that this is what a real Tex-Mex place is supposed to look, taste, or feel like.
At a real Tex-Mex place, tortillas are soft, fluffy vehicles for taco nirvana. At Avenida Cantina, tortillas are dry, except for the spots where they’re wet, presumably because someone tried the flick-it-with-water-then-nuke-it trick. Or because they dropped them in the sink. At a real Tex-Mex place, the refried beans should taste like fat, salt, and glory. At Avenida Cantina, they look like a poop emoji and taste much less cute. At a real Tex-Mex place, the margaritas are strong and tart and you don’t even realize that you’ve had two of them before your food arrives. At Avenida Cantina, you have to take shots of what is essentially sweetened tequila, just so you don’t have to taste it anymore. 
And at a real Tex-Mex place, you feel good. Actually, you feel great. It smells like heaven, you’re shoving salty chips and spicy salsa into your mouth before you even sit down in your chair, and the person bringing your food is excited to be your spirit guide into the pleasure zone. At Avenida Cantina, you don’t just feel uncomfortable - you feel trapped. Trapped in a room with a giant Texas flag on the wall and people who can't get your order right.
But what's most inexcusable is that Avenida Cantina is trying to convince you that this is real Tex-Mex. And that would give you one more reason to never want to come to Texas. And that would be a huge mistake. Because Texas is a great state. And Tex-Mex is our greatest triumph. Well, Tex-Mex and Willie Nelson."

At least there’s no chance you’ll be bumping into any of your new “city friends” that night and having to explain your high school nickname to them. You’re a different person now, “Cruiser.”
Then again, if you’re reading The Infatuation, you’re probably the type who won’t entertain any of that nonsense and refuses to go to Times Square for any friend. Instead, you end up taking every visitor around on a greatest hits restaurant glory tour and by the time they leave you’re fantasizing about salads and sleep and a lower interest rate on your credit card and maybe moving. But it doesn’t have to be this way. You can just take people to Carbone. It’s one of our all-time great restaurants, and it’s also the best Off-Broadway show in New York City.
Maybe not literally. But Carbone is certainly as much of a show as it is a restaurant, and it’s an impressive one. Owned and operated by one of New York’s most successful restaurant groups (Sadelle’s, Santina, Parm, Dirty French), Carbone is the live theater interpretation of every great red sauce Italian restaurant you’ve seen in the movies. You know, the ones with Chazz Palmienteri in (all of) them. The entire restaurant is a perfectly designed set, and the person serving you isn’t a waiter, he’s a “captain” in a red tuxedo, and he’s also basically an actor. An actor who just flipped around a chair at your table and sat down backwards on it to tell you about the specials and makes sure you know that he’s “here for whatever you need.” He’s also gonna “bring over some meatballs because you look hungry.” The whole thing is completely over the top, but in a good way. Well, in a mostly good way. The price of admission is a meal that will set you back $400 for four people if you order correctly.
Luckily, the food delivers, too, and overall Carbone is a lot of fun, even if you’re not using it to entertain someone who lives in a state that doesn’t touch water. It’s a great spot for a once-in-a-year special occasion, especially if the whole family is coming. Just know that it’s still one of the toughest tickets in town.

You should know how to politely not have a moment for the environment when a guy with a clipboard comes for you (sorry) and when to order delivery so that a hot meal is ready and waiting for you just as you get home. Seamless, it's just like the repressed 1950s housewife from your favorite prestige television drama.
Another thing you should have down pat as an Expert Level New Yorker? You should be able to get dropped in Chinatown, and quickly navigate those around you to a great, somewhat under-the-radar spot, where you'll tell everyone about the best thing to order.
When you find yourself in this situation, direct your group to Noodle Village. Tell everyone they have the best wonton soup in Chinatown, and that the soup dumplings are pretty good too. You won't be lying.
If your experiences with wonton soup have been relegated to slippery, doughy wontons filled with little bits of pork dropped into an oily soup, a trip to Noodle Village will change your perspective. The soup is light and doesn't just taste like something that came from a can, and the wontons are thin and filled with big chunks of shrimp. Since trying the wonton soup here, we find it hard to walk near Chinatown on a cold day without going in. And after trying some other places up the block with reportedly good wonton soup, we can confirm that Noodle Village's is indeed something special.
The space is nothing too notable, but it's a calm, not overly cramped room that seems like it's been recently renovated. You can come with a reasonably sized group, or roll in by yourself.

On the NYC side, we get usable public transit, some famous museums, bodegas, late-night delivery, and incredible pizza. Then again, LA has beaches, never-ending sun, more green juice emporiums than grocery stores, objectively happier people, and incredible fish tacos. 
But thanks to Los Mariscos, we can finally call the score even on that last one. The people behind our favorite tacos in Manhattan (Los Tacos No. 1) have done it again, this time with with seafood. To get here, you’ll have to delve even deeper into the hidden corners of Chelsea Market - once you’re at Los Tacos, turn left, make your way through the narrow hallway, and you’ll be dumped off into the promised land. (And if you want to avoid Chelsea Market altogether, you can even enter Los Mariscos directly from 15th Street.)
Despite being technically located in a glorified mall, Los Mariscos’ removed spot manages to feel like it’s an open-air neighborhood taqueria somewhere in Mexico. There are a few picnic tables, an open kitchen, some fluorescent Christmas lights, and a small bar with soccer on TV where you’ll grab a margarita. The whole operation is affordable, convenient, and efficient. And unlike Los Tacos No. 1, which still feels like it’s in a food court, you can comfortably hang out at Los Mariscos for multiple rounds of beers and tacos.But the real reason you feel like you could be in Mexico is because that’s where you find food like this. Everything Los Mariscos serves tastes like it was caught from an ocean five minutes ago. Your options are tacos, ceviche tostadas, and aguachiles (i.e. bathtubs of salsa and raw fish). You’re going to want to go heaviest on that first category, but you should dabble in all. Martha certainly would."

First of all, know that you are walking into a room that feels a bit different than some of the other Italian restaurants you’re used to. This place sort of looks like a Bond villain’s cocktail club, or Vladimir Putin’s country home, minus the weaponized mammoths. Second, prepare to spend more money than you might at another restaurant that serves elevated Italian food. This is a L’Artusi-like experience: pricey, but worthwhile if done correctly.
It’s fair to assume that some of what makes Casa Apicii feel like an oligarch’s crash pad is intentional, but also that some of it is simply a byproduct of the fact that the restaurant is located in an extravagant townhouse. The main dining room area is small and surrounded by an upper-level balcony so people can literally look down on you. There’s also a fireplace with an imposing mantle - one that feels perfect for a painting like this. Those seem to be leftover features from the somewhat ridiculous restaurant that preceded this one, The Lion. But all the crushed velvet and gold trimmings? Pretty sure those were Casa Apicii design choices.Whatever your feelings on opulence (I has it), once you get past the aesthetics, we think you’ll find that Casa Apicii is a very good restaurant. The menu is familiar - pasta, burrata, crudo… some chicken, and the good stuff is really good. Even the bad things are pretty tasty, and there’s an inventive touch to many of these Italian dishes that would otherwise be pretty straightforward. There’s also a secret (?) bar upstairs where you can have drinks before or after dinner, and you definitely should.
Our only real complaint with Casa Apicii is that the menu is very large and navigating it can be tough. Much of it changes with the season, and there are like seven too many crudo options. That, and we’re going to have to invest in some blazers if we’re going to keep having dinner here."

",4.0,French,Le Coucou,9.1,"Some people really enjoy fancy restaurants. The white tablecloths. The multi-course menu. The waiters with slicked back hair and difficult-to-place foreign accents.
I am not one of those people. I once hijacked a very thoughtful multi-course Valentine’s Day plan and made the case for going to Shake Shack instead. (It can be very romantic under those twinkle lights in Madison Square Park.) I usually end up dropping some piece of food on white tablecloths. I love great restaurants, but the pomp and circumstance of old-school fine dining has always made me feel like I’m a passenger on the Titanic or something.
And yet, I love Le Coucou. In many ways, Le Coucou is a fancy French restaurant - white tablecloths, candles on every table, a menu full of complicated French dishes with names you might not always recognize, dishes that come out in copper pots. But servers talk to you like a normal human, and the chef, an American who’s known for opening the excellent restaurant Spring in Paris, walks around in a black t-shirt rather than a chef’s hat. You could, in theory, wear jeans.Most importantly, the food is exceptional. Everything we’ve eaten here has been executed just right, and dishes feel like ever-so-slightly modernized versions of traditional French cooking. We’d never eaten a quenelle de brochet before (it’s kind of like a flan made out of seafood, which sounds terrible but is actually incredible), but we’re fairly certain there’s no better one in the United States. The duck comes with a side of foie gras and a little duck heart, and you can also eat pheasant or rabbit or veal tongue. (Don’t worry, there are oysters and salad and lobster tail and Dover sole too.) Seriously, all of it is great. And while prices are high, they aren’t offensive.
A meal at Le Coucou registers a few ticks above a place like L’Artusi or Maialino on the Nice Night Out scale, but definitely below your Le Bernardins of the world. There aren’t many places on that level - think of it as a newer, more downtown-y stand in for something like Marea. On our last visit, we sat across from Rachael Ray dining with Kathy Griffin and saw Clive Davis on our way out. Make of all of that what you will.
By the way, I did drop some endive salad on the white tablecloth. Didn’t even feel bad about it."

",3.0,French,King,7.7,"How much you like a restaurant is (obviously) about the food. It’s also about the vibes. But often what matters most? Who you’re eating with. And at King, that’s especially the case. 
On one visit to King, we came with what we're going to call a Kind-Of-Fancy friend. She knows a lot about lighting fixtures, she’ll choose the not-cheapest glass of wine before anyone else at the table figures out how to pronounce Aglianico, and she doesn't mind dropping $90 on a Tuesday night, especially if it's at a new spot.
Then we came back with another friend. He also knows how to order wine without word vomiting on himself. But for him to happily drop $90 at a restaurant, it needs to have some obvious f*ck-yes factor. This friend walked out of our dinner at King saying he probably didn’t need to come back.
We get it. King is across the street from Charlie Bird, and with its location, its young owners, and its daily-changing, hyper-seasonal menu, you expect it to feel just as cool as its neighbor. It doesn’t. King is much more formal - there are white tablecloths, the playlist is barely audible, the menu is short, the crowd swings mature, and the steak is called “onglet.” None of these are bad things, but they do get in the way of the f*ck-yes factor. 
But it's definitely there - you just have to look a little more closely. Once you accept that King isn’t what you expected, you settle in. You get ordering help from a highly charming, not-at-all pretentious server. You drink a cocktail that tastes like a gummy bear but somehow isn’t too sweet. You order the onglet, and it turns out to be one of the best steaks you’ve had in a while. And everything else you eat (like Malfatti pasta stuffed with butter and sage, and an actually-memorable piece of fish) is delicious too.So, will you like King? If you’re with a Kind-Of-Fancy friend, or some Kind-Of-Fancy parents, we think so. Alternatively, take a page from the guy sitting next to us at a two-top dining solo.

",2.0,Japanese,Ichiran,7.0,"If you've ever sat in a ramen shop by yourself and thought, ""This is cool but I wish I could do this without having to interact with other humans,"" then Ichiran is the ramen-eating destination of your dreams. A famous chain from Japan, Ichiran is well-known for its ""flavor concentration booths."" They're sort of like a study carrel in a college library, but for solo ramen eating. You fill out a form to place your order, press a button to order it, and basically avoid dealing with humanity for 30 minutes. You can lower the partition between booths if you don't fly solo, and there's also a regular dining room, if you're really afraid of loneliness.
The ramen comes in one variety - a pork-y tonkotsu broth - which you can customize to your liking. We'd recommend going for ""medium"" richness.
The restaurant feels like it could be in Midtown, but is actually located right off the Morgan L Stop in East Williamsburg/Bushwick, a few blocks down from Roberta's. If you're in the area, this is good soup, and the experience is a novelty worth enjoying at least once."

",3.0,Korean,Atoboy,7.6,"You know that feeling where you find something that you really love, but then you eat/drink/do it so often that you get sick of it and never want to see it again? We’ve officially reached that point with sparkling water, social media, and most of the restaurants in New York City.
Which is part of the reason we’ve become fond of Atoboy, a Modern Korean restaurant in that part of town where Murray Hill meets the Gansevoort Hotel. What are we calling that now? Meatpacking East? Nevermind. It’s not the location that makes Atoboy interesting.
What makes Atoboy interesting is that it actually feels like something new. The space is minimal and unique, made up of concrete and wood like a spa, or the modern home kitchen of someone who has really good taste but has never experienced true love.  Most of the tables are built for four or more, and it’s a big place that’s almost always full of groups of friends having dinner together. Isn’t that nice? And that’s exactly what Atoboy was designed for. The menu is structured such that eating at this restaurant with just one other person is almost a waste. $42 gets you a choice of three small plates, each about the diameter of one of those oversized coffee mugs that people give as Secret Santa gifts to people they hate. And when you have four people at your table, you can pretty much sample the entire Atoboy menu if everyone orders something different.
The food is modern Korean, and much of what you eat at Atoboy will be excellent. Some of it, however, will not. For instance, the incredible fried chicken in spicy peanut butter is basically my Guy Fieri dreams realized, minus the hair gel and sweating. But the eggplant dish jiggles a little too much, which is to say that it jiggles at all.
The good news, though, is that you won’t care about the inconsistency too much, assuming you do things right. Bring some friends, drink some drinks, order a bunch of food, and have a good time. Atoboy isn’t a place that should be judged on individual dishes, but as the sum of its parts. And even though I suck at math, I’m certain it all adds up to a restaurant we’ll come back to now and again. At least until we get sick of it."

",2.0,American,Esme,7.7,"It’s time we said what we believe. And you might not like it. If this offends you, we’re sorry. But we need to get it off our chest.
Brunch is dumb.
It’s dumb to pay $17 for two eggs. It’s dumb to wait an hour to eat said $17 eggs when you could cook them at home in one-twelfth of that time. It’s dumb to take pictures of said $17 eggs and put them on social media as if you should be congratulated for waiting for, paying for, and eating those eggs.
So when you find a place that makes brunch feel significantly less dumb, it means something. Esme is one of those places. 
This is a neighborhood spot through-and-through. At peak brunch times, you might encounter a short wait, but never long enough to give you the usual soul-sucking feeling that there are about 137 better things you could be doing with your Saturday. The space is light and bright - “cute” enough that you feel like a productive member of society even if you’re so hungover you can’t form sentences, but laid-back enough that you can wallow in your hangover without judgment. When it’s warm, there’s even a covered back patio that beats any wobbly-table sidewalk situation any day.As for the food: it’s good. The pancakes are killer, the eggs are always cooked how you ask, and there’s homemade granola and a solid avocado toast and a fried chicken sandwich. And cocktails. Also important: prices are what you actually feel good about paying (nothing is over $14). The food, plus the aforementioned easy elements of Esme might not seem special at first glance - but all of these things combine to make one of the least stupid brunches around.
So is Esme revolutionary? Depends on how much you think a not-dumb brunch is a revolution in itself."

Let’s, for a moment, pretend that you’re either new to this city because you moved here for a job or new to The Infatuation as a result of some kind of shrewd advertising campaign/online booby trap, and therefore we can pretend that you don’t already have Taïm on your list of all-time favorite falafels. Now we can write a review of this place and not feel like we’re preaching to the already converted.
Taïm is a legendary West Village falafel spot that pretty much everyone in this city has been obsessed with for a decade. As a matter of fact, this place has become so popular that they now have another location, a few offshoot restaurants, and a truck that roams the city. Why? Because a falafel sandwich at Taïm is the best thing that you can get in New York City for less than $10 and also theoretically eat every day without disastrous consequences. What else are you going to find in town that’s this tasty, this economical, and not absolutely f*cking lethal. Dirty water hot dogs? Yeah right. Dollar dumplings? Good luck with that. Five Guys? Better do some estate planning.
What we’re trying to tell you, fictional person who doesn’t already know and love this place, is that Taïm is a Cheap Eats dream. Oder a falafel sandwich or a sampler platter, find a seat at the counter or on the bench out front, and prepare to experience what the rest of the world already knows.
Are we done pretending now? Good. I need to get back to setting booby traps."

",3.0,Japanese,Sushi on Jones,7.7,"Most restaurants follow a set of culturally accepted norms. They let you stay as long as you like. They accept reservations either by phone, an app like OpenTable, or maybe don't take reservations at all. They have more than four seats. Most of them let you sit indoors.
So when we say Sushi On Jones breaks conventions, we don't mean it in the sense of, ""This restaurant only serves small plates!"" This ""restaurant,"" an outdoor, four-seat, omakase-only sushi bar where you're limited to 30-minutes and have to make a reservation by text message, pretty much just says f*ck you to all the things that normally make a restaurant a restaurant.The best way to get one of the four seats is to text them - the number's 917-270-1815, because we like making things easy for you. You'll show up for your allotted time slot, and from there you'll be served 12 pieces of sushi over the course of 30 minutes. The $50 (before tax and tip) menu includes scallop, crab, uni, hamachi, uni, eel, sweet shrimp, two styles of tuna, two styles of salmon, and seared wagyu beef. To finish, you get a piece of seared wagyu beef topped with a piece of uni. Looks like two different-colored tongues, tastes delicious. The pieces have light sauces and some of them are seared slightly, but overall the sushi is relatively straightforward and simple, and very good. Sushi On Jones' owner used to be the chef at Sushi Dojo, so if you've been there, you'll be familiar with the style.
Overall, there are some pros and cons that come along with being an outdoor, time-limited sushi bar. Having only 30 minutes to eat is short, but it also means you know exactly when you'll be seated and they can fit in a lot of people each night, even with four seats. And eating outside is always fun, as long as global warming isn't flexing its ""HEY I'M REAL"" muscles too hard. (There's an awning, but maybe don't come during a thunderstorm, blizzard, or the hottest day of summer).
If you can manage to get a seat, and have about $60 and a half hour to spare, this a fun, unusual, not ridiculously expensive omakase experience. It feels good to break the rules sometimes."

So while we're in the business of comparing Japanese noodles to Knowles sisters, we're going to bring udon into the picture. Udon is Kelly Rowland. Why? Well, first of all, there aren't any other Knowles sisters, and we weren't about to invent one. But it's also a good fit. You're definitely familiar with udon, even if you haven't heard much about udon recently.
Tsurutontan, an udon-focused restaurant near Union Square, is like if Kelly Rowland just released a new album. Is it a chart-topper that's going to change your life? Is it Lemonade? Are your friends going to text you in all caps about it? Nah. But it's still perfectly good, and worth a listen in its own way.
The bowls of udon here are absolutely massive, and eating them makes you feel like an extremely fancy caveperson. You can get your noodles pretty much any way you like - topped with uni, in a hot duck soup, in a creamy sauce with shrimp. There are other dishes on the menu too, but udon's what you'll want to focus on here. 
The space looks like a high-end spa, but they actually serve cocktails and the space gets livelier than it looks like it would. If you're really really into Japanese food, or if you work or live near Union Square, or if your best experience with udon has been relegated to midtown bodegas, this place is worth a try. Now Kelly, we're waiting for that album."

Smack dab in the middle of Park Slope, Brooklyn, Gristmill is a total misfit amongst its suburbia-like surroundings. It's certainly cooler than, say, the child-stuffed Calexico across the street, but it's also definitely not a cool restaurant (the lighting is a little too bright and the booths have yellow upholstery). You just can’t really put a label on this place. And that’s exactly why we like it.
There are two defining aspects about Gristmill: they’re serious about their wood-burning oven, and even more serious about their local, seasonal ingredients. At any other restaurant, a five-minute rundown on the farms where every dish was sourced might be humiliatingly tedious, but our waiter at Gristmill managed to do so in a completely not-pretentious, slightly eccentric, totally endearing way. Lovable weirdo.When it comes to the menu, Gristmill really lets its freak flag fly. It changes constantly, and you’ll see everything from kimchi & pork meatball toast to chicken liver mousse to beets served with edible flowers. We ate cornbread out of a corn husk. The sundae is topped with almost-too-peppery black pepper whipped cream. Oh, and there’s an entire section of pizzas with a wheaty, sourdough crust that’s strangely odd and addictive. Once you get used to the fact that your meal is not going to be consistent in any way, shape, or form, you settle into the weirdness. Because you realize it’s okay that nothing goes together. And because all of the food is really, really good. 
So when do you use Gristmill? It’s not sexy enough for a big date. It’s not safe enough for a first date. It’s probably too out of the way for your friend group dinner. The use cases are admittedly limited. But when you get tired of all your normal spots, Gristmill is good for getting a little weird."

As you’re probably sensing, Thursday Kitchen is a lively restaurant, with a pretty quirky menu. But don’t get the idea that this is some neon-covered gimmick, because it’s actually almost the opposite. The dishes here are small plates of Korean comfort food, all priced at $12 or less, which feels like a steal based on how large and how good so many of them are. There is “kimchi paella,” yes, but there is also a perfectly executed sliced steak, a killer soft shell crab with wasabi dipping sauce, a cold soba topped with tuna, and a fantastic take on a Korean seafood pancake. You can afford to order a lot of them, and you absolutely should.
The drinks here are limited to wine, beer, sake, and soju, which, by the way, is what those alcoholic light-up Capri Suns are filled with, so Thursday Kitchen may not be the spot for a night of heavy drinking.

Aita was one of those places for us. 
On a quiet, charming corner on the Clinton Hill/Fort Greene border, Aita always called to us. We’re easily seduced by neighborhood Italian spots, and whenever we passed this one it always looked especially enticing: a communal wooden table, a nice bar, homey details, and lots of people that always look so g*ddamn cozy.And just like how your college town bar ended up just being a bar, and The Olive Garden ended up just being a sad place with stale unlimited breadsticks, Aita is exactly as you would expect: a solid casual neighborhood Italian spot. The usuals suspects are all here (kale salad, calamari, grilled branzino, pastas), made with rotating seasonal ingredients, and good - though none are particularly memorable. This is the kind of place you’re lucky to have if you live nearby, but not quite worth making a journey for.

Meeting your aunt for a drink before you guys go catch Jersey Boys? Go to a restaurant bar. Order a martini and a glass of Pinot Noir. Maybe they'll have marcona almonds to snack on. Meeting for a first date you have a feeling will go well, at least in the sense that one of you will say, ""So, do you like hummus? Should we order the trio of Mediterranean dips to share?"" In that case, go to a cocktail bar where they'll probably have a trio of dips.
Zadie's doesn't fit into either of these categories exactly - it's more of a hybrid. We initially kept referring to this place as Zadie's Oyster Bar, until we realized it was actually called Zadie's Oyster Room. Very clever, restaurant-naming authorities. In this case, that's the owner of Hearth, which is right down the block. If you're an East Village vet, you might remember the wine bar Terroir - this is the same space.
Zadie's is just what it sounds like: a single room serving almost exclusively oysters, prepared every way you can think of: raw, steamed, baked, fried, broiled, poached. They come topped with prosciutto, and ginger, and leeks, and vermouth, and hijiki, and fennel, and probably some other ingredients you're going to have to either Google on your phone or ask the waiter about. There are some other small plates that change seasonally, but it's a stretch to build a full meal here, unless you want to eat oysters in a lot of different varieties.  You should plan to wash down your oysters with sparkling wine, especially during the Monday-Friday 5-7 happy hour, when both can be had for half price. There's regular wine and beer too, but no liquor.
Zadie's isn't quite as lively as our longtime favorite East Village oyster bar Upstate, and it's probably not going to become a standby for us just yet, but we'd certainly come back. While it's not the restaurant bar for your aunt or the cocktail bar for your upcoming date, it's a nice spot to meet a friend - just make sure that they like oysters first."

Or where they tell you about how the chef's grandfather owned a pizza place in ""Napoli"" (the Italian spelling is key) so his progeny decided that the East Village needed yet another Italian restaurant.
Le Garage, a French restaurant in Bushwick, definitely has an ""Our Story,"" and theirs is sweet. The short version: an interior architect decides to open a restaurant, and decides to do it with her mother, who, as it turns out, was a chef at a bunch of serious restaurants in Paris. The result is a friendly, well-designed but extremely understated and low-key restaurant that serves foie gras (the mom's recipe!) and a good chicken for two.This nice story has been circulated and celebrated, in places like The New Yorker, which means the restaurant is filled with a mix of people who live in Bushwick & Williamsburg and people with gray hair who haven't missed an issue of The New Yorker in 30 years and likely don't live in Bushwick.

Emmy Squared, the second restaurant from the people behind Emily, is a full-on pizza rager - only with pizza better than anything your single-digit brain could have thought up. Emmy’s specialty is Detroit-style, which technically means it’s square and thick and the sauce is usually on top of the cheese - but those words don’t do it justice. Emmy Squared’s pizza is the fancy, actually-delicious version of the thick-crust stuff you ate at every childhood party: cheese-fried-crunchy-crispy on the outside, warm-fluffy-molten on the inside. If you were the antisocial kid who always hoarded the cheesy breadsticks in the corner, Emmy Squared’s pizza is your new best friend.
.Eating here feels like something your mom would only let you do on special occasions. But now you’re an adult. And being an adult means that there’s no one standing between you and some deep-dish pizza, mayo-covered waffle fries, and a double-decker fried chicken sandwich. And the way to properly appreciate that freedom is to get yourself to Emmy.
About that fried chicken sandwich: it’s excellent. So excellent that we’d tell you to come to Emmy Squared for it alone. There’s also an incredible burger that easily rivals, if not tops Emily’s, though it’s only available at lunch in the restaurant, or on certain days in the evening at their bar downstairs.
Even Emmy’s space feels like Katie’s basement, where all the pizza-eating went down. It’s a little dark, it’s a little cramped, and it’s a little uncomfortable - but guess what: no one cares about not having backs on their chairs when they’re eating the adult version of kid pizza in a restaurant, especially when lots of alcohol is involved.
Just like the birthdays and sleepovers of your childhood, Emmy Squared probably isn’t for your average Tuesday night. But when the special occasion warrants it - whether that’s after a particularly rough day, or when Katie’s visiting from Texas, or when you’ve had enough of being kind of healthy - you can’t treat your inner eight-year-old much better than a pizza party at Emmy Squared."

Hao Noodle serves Chinese food that is both very tasty and which stands apart from any other Chinese food we’ve been able to eat in New York. From the claypot dumplings that are basically mini omelettes swimming in the best chicken soup broth you’ve ever had to the salty baby clams over greens to the perfectly fried shrimp hanging out in a huge bowl of chiles, this is the kind of food that you tell all your coworkers about the next day at work. We’ve eaten our way through a big portion of the menu, and while we have favorites, we can honestly say almost nothing is a real miss. Writing about the dishes here makes us want to eat them all again. The space is lovely as well - lovely in the sense that it could be repurposed as an Anthropologie store in about six minutes.  It’s a nice, bright place to eat nice, bright food. In these respects, Hao Noodle is a complete winner.But there’s another reason we’ve been back here so many times - we were hoping that with some time, this place would figure out what, precisely, the f*ck is going on. On various separate occasions, we’ve had food that never showed up, dishes we learned the kitchen was out of thirty minutes into the meal, and once, we we were even told how sorry the kitchen was that they had just run out of a dish… which we already had on our table. The servers, who seem to have been cast from the same agency that finds the guys who stand in front of the Hollister store, often appear confused. Let us not forget the guy who recommended the Dan Dan Noodles, citing the fact that New York Magazine said they were good. Or the other, who when we asked about the tofu sorbet dessert, described it as “good and cold.” (It was indeed VERY cold.) Each of these servers has been nothing but polite, but they also don’t seem to have much of a sense of anything relating to the kitchen, aside from the fact that it’s somewhere near the back. The resulting experience isn’t insulting or snooty - if anything, it makes you want to take Hao Noodle into the private conference room and ask if everything is OK.
We’re careful about calling out shoddy service - running a restaurant is hard, people have bad days, and whining about service is a great way to make everyone think you have a spiky pole up your butt. But the experiences here have been uniquely odd enough, time and time again, that we need to tell you about them before we send you here.

Izakaya Mew is a big underground Japanese izakaya on 35th between 5th and 6th, serving ramen, sushi, dumplings, and fried chicken. The music is loud, it's usually packed with people who look like they're having a good time, and they serve frozen beer slushies.To be clear, the food at Izakaya Mew is not… amazing. It's fine. The dumplings are solid, the ramen is hot, and the sushi is satisfying in the way that the sushi they serve at the cocktail hour of a fancy wedding is satisfying. In other words, if you're drunk and hungry, it's going to hit the spot. So will the Sbarro across from Penn Station, but please, have some dignity. At least find the nearest Ray's.
You don't need to travel across town for Izakaya Mew, but if you just drank 15 Bud Lights at a Rangers game and need to continue down that road with some food in your stomach, Izakaya Mew is just the place you want to be."

",3.0,American,Olmsted,8.9,"A back garden filled with every micro green you can imagine, all of which are watered by a high-tech sprinkler system. Mini apple trees, a makeshift crayfish farm in a bathtub, and a quail coop, all under picturesque string lights. An interior covered in leafy plants, with perfectly-curated hip hop and classic rock playing through the speakers. Bearded, man-bunned servers roam the room. No, this isn’t an SNL sketch about Brooklyn, this is real life. And it’s a real life restaurant that will go down as one of our favorite new places of the year.
They’ve painted the prettiest of Brooklyn pictures at Olmsted, which is run by a chef who spent time in the kitchens of Blue Hill at Stone Barns, Alinea, and Per Se, among others. And like those other establishments, Olmsted is definitely trying hard. Like, really hard: the video on their website is of a guy laser-focused on plating food using tweezers. But as outwardly serious as Olmsted may appear, what makes this place is so great is that they actually don’t take themselves too seriously.The food is incredible, and some of the most memorable dishes we’ve eaten in recent memory have been here. Take the carrot crepe with clams - a big ravioli made out of silky carrot, filled with a rocket ship of flavors and textures involving (but not limited to) briny clams. The guinea hen two ways is another example - an insanely tasty roasted bird breast injected with a green ramp mousse, served alongside a bowl full of dark-meat confit (aka mashed-up bird parts) topped with hollandaise sauce that results in edible happiness. It’s one of the more unique and impressive dishes we’ve ever encountered.
While the food is fancy, Olmsted overall is not - the most expensive item on the menu is $26, and the place feels like a cool neighborhood spot. It’s by no means inexpensive, but for a restaurant as impressive as this one, this is an affordable-ish way to eat a world class meal. They also have a great bar, the aforementioned back patio which you should hit early for a drink if it’s nice out, and a chef’s counter where you should try to sit.For as pretentious as Olmsted and its various perfectly-strung string lights and ramp mousse-filled hens could be, it’s actually all kinds of approachable and a really good time."

",3.0,American,Wildair,8.9,"There’s a type of restaurant setup that’s very common in Paris – a much acclaimed hot spot develops high demand, and in an effort to relieve some of the pressure, a cool, more casual wine bar is opened next door, often sharing the kitchen. It’s something we actually wished happened more in this city. Imagine if Carbone had a casual wine bar attached to the restaurant where you could stand around drinking Sangiovese and eating finger pasta™? We’d be there all the time.
This seems to be the concept that led to Wildair, a casual wine bar owned and operated by the team who run the much-acclaimed tasting menu restaurant Contra, somewhat as an extension of the original restaurant. And while it is similar in many ways, it’s not quite the same as those Parisian wine bars. Wildair actually feels more like the main event, and Contra the extension.Why? Because while Contra is an exciting, special restaurant, Wildair is built for the way that the average New Yorker wants to eat most frequently: casually, with a friend or two, over some food to share. Ideally with wine. And excellent food. And great service. And somewhat reasonable prices. Yes, we New Yorkers have high, often unreasonable standards for our daily lives. That’s why you’re still single.
Much like the last person you dated, we initially found that Wildair checked off all of the important boxes, but also had a few tiny flaws. The menu was inconsistent, often feeling a little too experimental. Sometimes we’d even come across a dish that was way too salty. But we’ve made return visits quite often since our initial review, and it turns out that, unlike that imperfect human that you quickly moved on from, this restaurant has only gotten better with age. The menu is now full of hits that you can come back to every time, while maintaining enough variety to keep things interesting. It’s both inventive and accessible, adventurous and delicious.
So, while there will always be a special place in our hearts for Contra, we’ll save that for the more special nights out. Wildair is our new everyday restaurant, and we’re glad we spent some time waiting for it to get a little closer to perfect."

",2.0,Italian,Malaparte,8.1,"At one point or another, you might have harbored some dream about living in the West Village. Wouldn’t it be great? Waking up in a charming little townhouse apartment on a cobblestone street, waving hello to your celebrity neighbors’ children and occasionally ending up in the background of their paparazzi photos? You’d whimsically end up buying a small dog one fall Sunday afternoon from that shop called “Le Petit Puppy.” And of course, you’d be a regular at some under the radar, charming, low-key neighborhood restaurant.
Except, here’s the thing: that studio apartment’s “bathroom” is a cracked bathtub located next to the refrigerator. Your neighbor isn’t actually the smiling offspring of the star of your favorite prestige TV drama, but actually an old man who watches those NY1 call-in shows with the door open all day. That pet store actually closed, probably because drunk people buying pets that come from puppy mills is a bad idea for everyone involved. And does that lively, dimly-lit, brick-walled restaurant on a pretty corner even exist?
Actually, it does. While that apartment full of natural light on Jane Street will probably have to remain a figment of your imagination, the charming neighborhood restaurant you envisioned is actually real, and it’s called Malaparte.Brick walls, wood floors, good pastas and salads, heavy pours of red wine, a generally pleasant crowd - they’re all there at Malaparte. The food isn’t revolutionary, but it doesn’t need to be, and that’s kind of the point. If you take a date here, they’ll be impressed, but not because the restaurant is fancy or “impressive.” They’ll be impressed because you happened to know about this cute little restaurant on Bethune and Washington.
If you do go, know that you’re not the only person who found this diamond in the rough - so expect a wait at peak times. You can use the time to pick up some cash, because they’re a cash-only establishment. (Of course they are.) If you’re planning to be a group of four or more, they do take reservations, but only over the phone. (Again, of course. What do you think this is, Chelsea or Flatiron?)
By the way, the bathtub in your imaginary apartment is leaking. Into the old man’s apartment."

",3.0,American,Cherry Point,7.7,"When Cherry Point was being built, we stopped in to ask the contractors what was coming. 
""A real classy spot. A place with a nice bar.”
Got it. So a place just like every other new restaurant in Brooklyn. But it was still reason enough to be intrigued. Not because Greenpoint is lacking in good new restaurants, but because this particular street - Manhattan Avenue - hasn’t quite caught up with the gentrification the rest of the neighborhood has seen. When a hip new spot opens among the traditional Polish bakeries, Polish butchers, and Polish bodegas, you notice it.
Fast forward a few months, and Cherry Point is pretty much exactly as described: a classy new spot on a street where it stands out for being such. If anything, the place is trying just a little too hard - there are books on the wall, lots of exposed lightbulbs, and the kind of scattered, seemingly-sentimental random objects (a disco ball, a fireman’s hat) you imagine restaurants collect over time, but Cherry Point somehow accumulated in only a few months. That said, we’re not going to judge it, because those details are part of what makes Cherry Point a highly enjoyable place to hang out in. And that bar the guy mentioned? It’s the best seat in the house.Unlike so many restaurants bending over backwards to accommodate the need for something “kind of healthy,” Cherry Point is quietly giving a hard pass to all that. Instead, you come to Cherry Point to sit at the bar, order a well-made cocktail, and go to town on a giant charcuterie plate, or a perfectly-cooked steak with some perfectly crispy fries. There’s not a whole lot on the menu, and you have to look pretty hard to find any vegetables, but what Cherry Point does (meats, cheese, bread), it does well.
This isn’t a destination restaurant by any means - it’s a place for the people that live around here. And that’s why, while Cherry Point might stick out a bit in its surroundings, it feels like something actually good for the neighborhood. Disco ball and all."

",2.0,American,The Brooklyn Barge,7.3,"Summer in New York City is the greatest. There are free movies and concerts (not like you’ve gone to one since the summer you moved here, but still), you can bike or walk everywhere (not like you take any fewer cabs, but still), and it’s socially acceptable to order a frozen negroni at 11am. 
But summer in New York City can also be the absolute f*cking worst. You constantly feel the need to shower, you’re certain that every tourist is conspiring to make your commute as painful as possible, and you're constantly assaulted by a haunting combination of sewage and garbage smells. 
Which is why, during the summer in New York City, you look for places that make you feel like you are somewhere else. Somewhere away from the smells. And all the other sweaty humans. 
The Brooklyn Barge is one of those places. After a couple drinks on this barge/bar/restaurant on the East River in Greenpoint, you can close your eyes and almost believe you’re on your own private boat (more speedboat than yacht, but still). But you won’t even want to do that for long, because the Manhattan skyline views are so good.So good that we’re willing to mostly overlook The Barge's faults: it's cash only, the prices are higher than they should be, and the bar food - while totally acceptable - isn't anything to write home about. But for its ideal setting, and the fact that it's somehow not yet completely mobbed, we can forgive a lot. 
You could easily come to The Brooklyn Barge to eat a full meal and be satisfied. But honestly, you won't have to. Get yourself a hot dog, get yourself some alcohol, find a seat, and you'll be happy as a golden retriever wearing sunglasses. If and when you get really hungry, there's always Paulie Gee’s around the corner. 
Just when you’re ready to give up on this sweaty, garbage-smelly black hole we call home, The Brooklyn Barge is here to remind you that this is actually a pretty amazing place to be."

",1.0,Tacos,Chilo's,8.3,"If you live in New York, you've probably come to terms with a sad fact: the tacos in this city suck. 
Not all of them, obviously. Amidst the vast majority of places selling a plate of bland lumps of meat on microwaved tortillas for $18 and calling it a day, there are a good handful of spots that make great tacos. But those gems are few and far between, and they've all been discovered. Right? 
Unless you already knew about Chilo’s, wrong. Because these tacos are some of the best in the city. And if you’re like us, you had no idea.  
Our first trip here, we looked around the place expecting everyone else to also be whisper-screaming obscenities into their tacos. But no, that was just us. Apparently, some people have known about Chilo’s. If you’re one of those people, please stop holding out on us.Chilo’s is a taco truck parked permanently on the back patio of a divey, Mexican-themed bar on the Clinton Hill/Bed-Stuy border. And it’s proof that the only thing better than a killer taco truck is a killer taco truck parked in the back of a bar. You never have to worry that the driver decided to try his luck on a different street, and the margarita supply is unlimited.
You'll get your drinks inside the bar, then walk out back to order what you’re really there for. You'll want three tacos if you're hungry, but you could easily put away four. We’ve undergone the challenge of trying them all, and the smoked beef, carnitas, cochinita pibil, and fried fish are our favorites (more on the rest below). You’ll wait - in agony, but not for very long - until your name is called by a man that very well may be the jolliest chef in New York City.
And why wouldn't he be? He's spreading the gospel of actually-excellent tacos. His happy vibes, coupled with music ranging from blasting opera to Michael Jackson deep cuts, mixed with a crowd made up of obvious regulars, makes Chilo’s an awesome, laid-back neighborhood hang you’ll want to stick around for long after you’re done eating. 
Chilo’s is doing its part to make tacos in this city suck less. Your civic duty is to eat them."

",2.0,American,Speedy Romeo LES,7.8,"Walk into Speedy Romeo’s Lower East Side location, and you’ll probably think to yourself, “This looks like a bar. Or a pizza place.”
Maybe you’re someone who walks around narrating their life, and you literally registered, “Note to self: this restaurant looks like a bar. And many people are eating pizza,” into your brain’s voice recorder system. Then you might wonder if other people also narrate their lives as if they were Morgan Freeman doing the voiceover for a National Geographic documentary. Or maybe you’re just normal and noticed it indirectly. Either way, you’re definitely going register that vibe somehow, because the Lower East Side space does feel like it used to be a dive bar, and like a place to hop on a bar stool and get involved with some pizza. There’s also the fact that the whole back of the menu is dedicated to said pizza.
Which is a bit strange, because that’s actually not what you should eat here.
While the pizza is perfectly enjoyable, the real highlights of Speedy Romeo are the more “restaurant-y” items: the octopus, the steak, even... the kale salad and the branzino.The same is actually true of Speedy’s original location in Clinton Hill/Bed-Stuy, but it feels a bit more natural in that space - an awesome, spacious converted garage on a street corner. It feels like a neighborhood landmark, and it feels like a place to order a steak or a piece of fish.
The LES Speedy makes some great food, but to get the best possible experience, you have to be OK with eating it in what’s really a dark little bar. Otherwise, get that internal monologue going again and start telling yourself to head to Brooklyn."

",3.0,American,Rider,6.8,"A prime Williamsburg location. A space that’s shared with an indie music venue. A menu that includes both vegan salads and bone marrow. A name that makes you think of motorcycle jackets, and also a rich person’s toddler. 
Rider must be the coolest restaurant in Brooklyn, right?
Not quite.
At first glance, Rider is an easy choice for a night out in Williamsburg. And if you do end up here, you'll be pleased with the food. It's well-executed across the board, with healthy-ish options and a couple real standouts. The service is also friendly. And the whole tip-included thing continues to trick us into thinking we’re getting a deal.
But Rider doesn't have a whole lot of magic. That special quality that makes you feel like you are truly winning at life. Or at least in your restaurant decision.Maybe that’s because Rider is trying a little too hard to be everything to everyone. The menu reads like a kitchen sink of stuff people tend to like. Roast vegetables? Check. Spaghetti? Yep. Chicken nuggets, a burger, fried oysters? Gang’s all here. Having lots of options is great - especially when you're with high-maintenance eaters - but there’s such a lack of focus you're left wondering what to order. On a recent trip, a server hard-sold our group on sharing the most expensive thing on the menu - the ribeye. It was good, not great. 
Rider's setup also has a case of split personality: there are two floors, which might as well be different restaurants. The bottom is light and bright, and feels like it should be in a hotel lobby, while the top is much darker, and reads a little too serious.
The experience ends up feeling best suited for French tourists staying in Airbnbs nearby who want to see Williamsburg. And older people who are suddenly interested in going out to eat in Brooklyn. We like grown-ups, and we like Europeans, but Rider isn't your best bet for seeing and being seen. Then again, neither is this part of Williamsburg anymore.
If you end up at Rider, you probably won’t fall in love with it, but you’ll enjoy it just fine. Especially if you’re with out-of-town relatives who want to see what “The Shmorgasburg” is.  
Just leave your motorcycle jacket at home. You won’t need it."

",2.0,American,Lighthouse,8.8,"Every time Monday rolls around, we want to eat at Lighthouse. We’re ready to invent a Perfect For: Mondays category because of Lighthouse.
There’s just one problem. Lighthouse is closed on Mondays. 
It’s kind of like finding out that someone you thought you liked is a plane clapper. The pilot can’t hear you. And he’s not one of the Wright Brothers. 
That almost-dealbreaker aside, we can confidently say we’ve found our favorite spot to spend all other weeknights in Williamsburg.
A triangle-shaped space on the corner of a mostly-empty block, Lighthouse is covered with giant open windows that let in tons of natural light and breeze. There are always people here, but never any crowds. The place feels like it belongs somewhere else - like a place where people don’t sometimes pee on sidewalks. But it’s not just the atmosphere that makes Lighthouse feel like the exact place you want to be at the end of your day.You want to be at Lighthouse because the food is absolutely excellent. It’s the kind of fresh, sort of healthy stuff you’ve seen around town: grilled vegetables, ceviche, octopus, chicken - but done much, much better than usual. There’s even a destination-worthy burger. 
Lighthouse isn’t just another Williamsburg spot that uses “local” ingredients, has an oyster happy hour, and serves “interesting” wines. Lighthouse does all those things - but does them with real intensity. Their ingredients aren’t just fresh - there’s apparently a guy named Carlos who brings Lighthouse its chickens straight off a farm every two days. Their happy hour isn’t just a good deal - the wine glasses on special are from whatever bottle happens to be open, giving you a chance to try stuff you otherwise might not. And unlike a lot of casual-seeming places with not very casual prices, everything at Lighthouse is actually affordable. Lighthouse doesn’t just talk the talk. It walks it, too.
If you don’t live in the neighborhood, you might not think to trek to Williamsburg on your usual weeknight for chicken, or a burger, or grilled vegetables. But this restaurant is a reason to reconsider. 
Lighthouse doesn’t settle, and neither should you. See you on Tuesday."

",3.0,American,Freek’s Mill,7.6,"It must be good to be a firewood dealer in New York City these days.
Not because the impending apocalypse has people stocking up on readily available energy resources, and not because Gwyneth Paltrow just said that having a pot belly stove in your apartment will make your skin clearer (she didn’t).
The wood business is booming because all the new restaurants these days seem insistent on cooking with it.And we’re not complaining. A common thread amongst many of our all time favorite restaurants is the fact that they make food in a wood burning oven, from Lilia to Pasquale Jones to Speedy Romeo. Food just seems to taste better when cooked at very high temperatures in a dome shaped apparatus, and as far as we’re concerned, the more time we can spend in places that smell like a smoky Vermont cabin, the better. So now you know. If you want to get Infatuation excited about your restaurant, just open a spot modeled after an 18th century New England kitchen.
That’s why we were so excited to check out Freeks Mill, a restaurant in Gowanus that’s in the market for some wood. They have a small open kitchen in the back of their very aesthetically pleasing new restaurant, and in the back of that kitchen is a dome full of fire. And from that dome of fire comes some pretty delicious food.
Freek’s Mill is apparently inspired by the days when Gowanus was farm land, when the Canal was actually a creek and assumingly far less full of poison. What that means is locally sourced food gets cooked over flames, and the vibe is rustic but modern. Think of it as a mix between Vinegar Hill House and The Pines. We like both of those places a lot. And we like Freek’s Mill too.
But we also want to like Freek’s Mill a whole lot more than we currently do. Many of the things you’ll eat at this restaurant are absolutely excellent. The carrots, the pastas, the wood-fired oysters, the dry aged duck - they’re all very good. But there are also some times when things seem a bit too fussy - like the fried chicken livers on the dandelion salad, or the fact that the wine list is almost entirely made up of Chenin Blanc and Beaujolais. We assume there’s a reason for that, but we don’t really know what it is. People want options. And a lot of people don’t want Beaujolais.
Either way, Freek’s Mill is a solid addition to this part of Brooklyn, and we suspect that it’s the kind of place that will only get better over time. For Gowanus and the surrounding neighborhoods, it’s a very good option for your next date night or laid back evening out with some friends. Especially if you feel the same way that we do about fire wood. And even more so if you disagree about Beaujolais."

Did you just discover that Lily Allen’s brother is Theon Greyjoy from Game Of Thrones? (We just learned about that one recently, and... whoa, right?)
That’s how we felt after eating at Malatesta. After enjoying our meals and mentioning it to friends, we were routinely met with, “Of course, everyone knows about that place! It’s great.”
Let us guess: You’ve known about this charming little Italian spot in the West Village ever since you moved to the city. Your mom really liked the meatballs. You went there on your first date with your spouse. You had a casual birthday dinner there a few years back. Well, thanks for sharing. If you are one of these people who’s apparently known about Malatesta for years and declined to tell us about it, feel free to stop reading.But on the off chance, like us, you weren’t previously acquainted with Malatesta, allow us to introduce you. A cash-only, simple Italian restaurant, Malatesta is a bit like the West Village’s version of Frank or Lil’ Frankie’s - not exactly life-changing, but a place for reliable, tasty food in a welcoming environment. Use it for a casual date or for a group dinner (call to make a reservation). Be charmed by the handwritten menu. Don’t get too annoyed by the occasionally half-baked service. Bring cash. Start out with a fairly cheap bottle of red and some calamari, and finish off with meatballs and a pasta to share.
Also, from here on out: let’s not let each other be late to things. If you happen to come across a great restaurant we don’t know about, or discover two celebrities are actually related, please let us know."

",4.0,Italian,Hearth,7.9,"Here’s how you know we’ve reached peak health food: Trader Joe’s has a two-bag-per-customer limit on frozen cauliflower. That’s right. People are so scared to eat a carbohydrate that they have resorted to fighting in grocery store aisles over who is going to take home the last bag of sadness.
Clearly, the health trend has also taken hold in restaurants. And we’re all for it. Eating responsibly is important. Sugar is bad. Gluten is the enemy. Cayenne pepper will make you skinny, and turmeric will make you live forever. We’re down with all the fads. But we’re drawing the line at f*cking cauliflower rice. Can we really carry on like this?
Luckily, there are a few restaurant examples of the health food trend done right, without having to resort to serving people bags of sadness. But we’re betting you didn’t expect us to tell you that Hearth is one of them.Between the years of 2003-2014, Hearth was known as an excellent rustic Italian restaurant in the East Village that was Perfect For that night when your parents came to see your new apartment on 8th Street and you wanted to distract them from the fact that you’re spending $1600 a month to sleep standing up. It was a nice place, best saved for a special night out. It also wasn’t cheap, and the food was quite heavy. Nonetheless, we loved it.
Then, right around the time when everyone else in this town woke up and realized that eating ramen and pork buns three nights a week was probably a bad plan, chef/owner Marco Canora started tinkering with serving bone broth out of a tiny kitchen window next to Hearth. Apparently broth is good for you, and apparently people are willing to spend money drinking coffee cups full of it.
That, and other factors, led to a full revamp of the Hearth menu - and kitchen for that matter. No more processed oils, no more industrial flours, and fewer manufactured sugars are used to make the food, and the focus has shifted to more fresh vegetables, responsibly raised animals, and even house-milled flour to make the pastas. It’s a pretty major transformation that owes itself more to a change in belief system than it does an effort to keep up with a trend - and it’s one that has made the restaurant better.
In reality though, Hearth hasn’t changed all that much. It’s still an excellent place for dinner with a slightly higher price tag than most neighborhood restaurants, making it an unlikely candidate for those nights you’re coming home from work and just looking to eat something healthy. But at least you’ll know that the food you’re spending your money on is better for you than what you eat on almost any other night. And you won’t have to fight anyone to get it."

Legitimately sexy in the sense that everyone we’ve brought here has left saying, in some form, that this restaurant made them want to go home and have sex in a bathtub.
Mimi is a tiny little spot in Greenwich Village with dim lighting, ice cold martinis, a marble bar, tables that are extremely close to each other, and a general aura of cool French person-ness. Once again: sexy.
It’s possible that your next question is: “But what about the food?“, but it’s also quite likely that it’s not. Because the food at a vibey restaurant like this is usually besides the point. Chop up some tuna tartare, shuck some oysters, stir some strong drinks, maybe cook a decent steak frites, and throw on a cool playlist, right?
Except, wrong. Which is what makes Mimi a restaurant we like so much.In fact, Mimi’s daily-changing menu is actually one of the most serious you’ll find in a not-too-serious restaurant. You’ll find monkfish liver mixed with your vegetables, sea urchin mixed with your gnocchi, and pork rillettes to start everything off. If you’re into blood sausage, you can have that, too. And the only tartare we’ve seen at Mimi is veal. Most restaurants serving these ingredients tend to be where the waiters are in suits, which Mimi is decidedly not. The menu is handwritten, the waiters wear white t-shirts, and so on.
If you like to stick to fish and chicken, you’ll find those here, too, and you can definitely still have a good meal doing so. But the fun of Mimi, really, is pairing a bottle of red with some innards. That’s sexy, right?"

A retail shop and Jewish deli counter with around fifteen seats on the Greenpoint/Williamsburg border, Frankel’s was opened by two New York born and bred brothers, one of whom is in the band Holy Ghost!. We’ll give him a pass for that exclamation point since he’s partly responsible for this place.While Russ & Daughters and Sadelle’s are very much a production -- with their flashy-ness, high prices, and long waits -- Frankel’s couldn’t be farther away from all of that. You’ll stand in a fast-moving line, you’ll order at the counter, your name will be called, and you’ll find a seat. If there aren’t any? You’ll take your food fifty steps to McCarren park. Frankel’s is no risk, all reward. 
You might only be in the restaurant for a few minutes, but the place is made to make you feel good while you’re there. Frankel’s got all the details right: the design is light and bright and nostalgic (without feeling kitschy), they sell homemade babka and black & white cookies, and the pour-it-yourself hot coffee is strong and delicious. The line moves fast, your food comes out quickly, and the people working the counter (often the owners/brothers) are happy to help you make the toughest decision of your day.But none of that compares to the moment when your order is called. Because the food here is absurdly good. From the lox, to the latkes, to the brisket, to the pastrami, egg & cheese, we haven’t eaten anything here that didn’t impress. Even the BEC (definitely not Jewish, definitely don’t care) is taken to another level. Whether you’re here to cure your hangover or show your out-of-town friends who get really excited about eating bagels in New York City a cool Brooklyn spot, you will leave satisfied.
On your way out, try not to laugh at the mob of people across the street waiting out their two-hour quote at Five Leaves. They’ll realize what they’re missing eventually. Because Frankel’s isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. This is a new classic."

",3.0,Italian,Cafe Altro Paradiso,7.3,"During one period of my life, I used to make an espresso every afternoon and drink it while standing up in my apartment. Why? Because I was addicted to caffeine, but more importantly, because I enjoyed pretending I was Italian. 
It was a very certain type of Italian: one who wears an entirely tan wardrobe, probably owns a vintage bicycle, gets photographed on fashion blogs but doesn't give a sh*t about that. Definitely drinks espresso while standing up every afternoon.
Cafe Altro Paradiso, it seems, also would like to be a cool, laid back, understated Italian. And at times, they do it right: a lot of the food is tasty, the service is great, and if you hit it early in the evening, the light shines in through the big windows in a way that's pretty damn nice. At other times, like when you order a kind of boring octopus or a pasta that's just a bit too minimalist, that attempt at an expensive tan suit just ends up looking like, well, a pair of regular khakis.The food here, obviously, is Italian, but you're not going to find any red sauce (tan suit, remember?). The menu changes daily - they're either still getting a feel for what dishes work best or just really enjoy mixing it up - so it's tough to say what exactly to expect on a given night. That said, the appetizer section is the strongest (and seems to change the least), the pastas are small and tasty but not quite-destination worthy, and the entrees are actually pretty large - not usually something to write home about but a good move if you want to share something filling.
Cafe Altro Paradiso is run by the people behind Estela, the funky and beloved restaurant in Nolita that Obama ate in once. And frankly, if you haven't tried Estela, we'd direct you there first. It's cozier, a little more fun, and more of an essential New York restaurant. Cafe Altro Paradiso, on the other hand, is a nice place to have a glass of wine or a cocktail, perhaps at the bar, along with some starters and maybe a main course to share.
Finish it off, of course, with an espresso."

",3.0,American,High Street on Hudson,7.8,"Have you ever heard the phrase, “a mile wide, an inch deep""? I have, mostly in all of those startup articles I don’t read. I think the concept basically boils down to the belief that, in business, it’s better to do one thing and do it very well, rather than to take on many things and execute them all rather poorly. That, or it’s the formula for building an ideal-sized pond for remote control boats. Either way, I’m about to work it into this restaurant review.
Here are just a few of the things that High Street on Hudson makes on a daily basis: bread, bagels, bialys, beet-cured salmon, granola, donuts, cookies, breakfast sandwiches, lunch sandwiches, salads, soups, and stroopwafels. And that’s all before dinner, which consists of things like grilled tripe, eel toast, cauliflower-stuffed pasta, sunflower seed risotto, crispy broccoli, and, of course, a chicken for two. If that’s not the definition of going a mile wide, nothing is. But somehow, High Street on Hudson manages to go deep on every single thing on that list.This West Village establishment comes to us via Philadelphia, where it’s been known as one of the city’s best restaurants basically since the day they opened in late 2013. Now that the chefs behind High Street have decided to bring a near exact replica to NYC, the question becomes, how will this do in a place with a whole lot more restaurants and plenty of bakeries, too? The answer so far seems to be: very well. High Street on Hudson draws crowds at most hours of the day, some for their excellent breakfast, many for the amazing sandwiches they offer during lunch, and dinner is usually bumping, too, when the menu turns more advanced and adventurous. We’ve been various times for various meals, and we like High Street a lot. They certainly do a lot of things, and they do a lot of them well.
The tricky thing with this restaurant is figuring out how best to incorporate it into your life. If you live in or near the West Village, it’s a fantastic place to grab a midday meal or pick up a loaf of bread, assuming you’re the kind of person that occasionally picks up loaves of bread. We can and have traveled for a lunchtime pastrami sandwich, and you should, too. High Street during the day is laid back and full of delicious things to eat. But dinner is the part we have a hard time with. Not because the food isn’t as good - nearly everything we’ve had at High Street at night has been excellent. It’s the use case.
Dinner is when it becomes apparent that this is a restaurant run by very serious food people. The menu is full of things you won’t see at most other places around town (see, tripe) and they offer a prix fixe that will take you on quite a ride. It’s also serious enough that High Street would be a tough destination for a date or a casual dinner in the ’hood. If you’re looking for a serious food experience, you’re in business. If you’re looking for a salad and a piece of halibut, you are not.
So maybe High Street isn’t going a mile wide after all. Maybe they’re going a mile deep on serious food for serious food people. Sandwiches included."

",3.0,American,Covina,8.2,"Oh look. An American/Mediterranean/Italian restaurant with a name that sounds like a made up Italian word but is actually a town in Southern California. Located in a hotel in the 20s just off Park Avenue. Serving pizza and vegetables and chicken. ALERT THE PRESSES. Right?
At first glance, Covina seemed like a restaurant that might be what we’d call a “useful” restaurant. It could be a nearby place to settle on when a reservation at Upland isn’t in the cards. It could be a fine place to recommend for people who work in the area. And it is those things. But after several visits, we found it to be quite a bit more. Everyone we know who has tried Covina has agreed: this place is actually quite good.Everything coming out of the kitchen here is extremely tasty, and some of it’s even pretty inventive. The curried cauliflower is a hit, the questionable-sounding brussels sprouts/fontina/mascarpone/pear pizza turns out to be awesome, and the big sheaths of mandilli pasta are a must order. There’s a lot of great food in between as well. On top of that, the service is notably and noticeably friendly. Not in an annoying or overbearing way, but in the “we want you to actually have a nice time here and as a result we are going to decidely be un-assholeish” way.
Covina might not be the spot for a very special occasion or a bucket list-type meal, but it’s more than simply a “useful” restaurant. It’s a very good restaurant."

",3.0,Thai,Uncle Boons,9.3,"Uncle Boons has not traditionally been one of “our spots.” We love this Nolita Thai restaurant and gave it a very high rating not long after it opened. But for some reason, it hasn’t been a place we’ve spent the last few years recommending frequently to friends.
Why? We honestly don’t know. Maybe we got amnesia. Maybe we got distracted by something shiny. Maybe Mom was right about those choices we made in college “catching up with us.”
But a few internal conversations and a strong desire for really good Thai food recently brought us back to Uncle Boons and forced us to come face to face with the question: Why don’t we talk about this place more? Despite not having a good answer, it’s time to rectify the situation.
Uncle Boons is one of the great dining experiences of NYC. It’s not just a place where you can eat unbelievable curry, and a ridiculous sundae, and the coldest beer known to man. It’s a place where you can eat all of that in an underground treehouse that might have been decorated by a Thai grandma who’s addicted to Craigslist. And it’s a place that’s as suited for a fun date night as it is for a dinner with friends celebrating nothing other than your eating talents. The buzz around Uncle Boons may have died down – but the buzz at Uncle Boons is still going very strong. It’s always packed, and that buzz is contagious. 
There are always new restaurants opening in New York. Some are successful, some not so much. But Uncle Boons is proof that the good stuff finds a way. Even if it does so quietly.
Uncle Boons is now officially one of our spots. And it should be one of yours, too."

",3.0,American,Nix,7.7,"Maybe you’ve heard of Nix because you’re a vegetarian. Maybe you’ve heard of Nix because Narcissa is your favorite spot. Maybe you’ve heard of Nix because you live or work or go to school near this fast-casual-stuffed land between Washington Square Park and Union Square. 
Nix is a grown-up, entirely vegetarian and vegan establishment, in an area previously lacking in both such kinds of places. But while Nix does feel like the upscale, healthy-ish restaurant that artsy NYU professors have been waiting for, this isn’t the second coming of Narcissa.
Like at the chef Jon Fraser’s other restaurants, the vegetables here don’t pretend to be something they’re not - he just knows how to make them taste good. But thanks to plenty of bread products and the use of a deep fryer, Nix also isn’t a place where you’ll eat a super healthy meal, unless you’re really making the effort. (And if you are, you should probably stick to the vegan menu - which is the same as the vegetarian menu, minus the good stuff.) Overall, the food here is tasty and interesting, but not to the level that you leave the restaurant needing to tell everyone in your life (vegetarian or otherwise) to get here immediately.
Nix hits right in the middle of the casual-to-fancy spectrum, which is another reason this is a useful addition to the neighborhood. A lot of thought clearly went into the design - there are lots of plants, expensive-looking linen napkins, and a few well-chosen pieces of art. Nix is an attractive space - but you know that feel-good vibe you get in the room at Narcissa? That feeling isn’t here.Nix is a restaurant by and for adults - and that feeling of seriousness hangs like a chaperone over the whole experience. Kind of like you’re hanging out with a mom. A cool one, but still a mom. The kind of mom who will go in hard on a bottle of Pinot Grigio at dinner, but also isn’t at the point where she’s experimenting with “edibles” now that the kids are out of the house.
While we’re happy about what Nix brings to the neighborhood, we’re also not going to come here for any potentially sexy situations. Meeting a client? Absolutely. Hot date? Not unless you’re okay with a cool mom third wheeling."

",2.0,French,Excuse My French,7.4,"Many bars and restaurants on the Lower East Side have familiar elements: model-like bartenders in possibly ripped white t-shirts, waiters with Australian accents, a drinks list that features all “natural wines.” The clientele? People who have “creative director” in their Instagram bios.
We get it, you’re cool.
Excuse My French is not cool. At least not in that way, and that’s exactly why we like it.
The wallpaper is green and gold, there are still life paintings on the walls in gaudy gold frames, and the big ticket cocktail is a deep purple mezcal concoction that magically turns pink when the bartender stirs in the last ingredient in front of you. And wait, is that fake library wallpaper on the door to the bathroom? You bet it is.
All of this creates the weird, funny charm of Excuse My French. But the real draw here is the food, which is really good.The menu is a selection of French-inspired bar food, which naturally means some meat and cheese on baguettes, but also a lot more. Both the scallop carpaccio and little tagine of cajun chicken are dishes we’d eat over and over again. The tapas-style food and the variety of dishes makes it a good choice for drinks or a date where you’re not sure how much you’ll eat, or what kind of food the other person likes.
Everyone we’ve taken here has left saying, “Huh - I kind of really like this place,” and we do too."

",4.0,Italian,La Sirena,7.0,"A funny thing happens at the nexus of southernmost Chelsea, eastern Meatpacking, and the northern West Village. You wind up at dinner. For years, the Maritime Hotel and its former restaurant inhibitor, La Bottega, has been a pre-approved, universally acceptable meeting place for all dining-related gatherings planned by people you’re either kind of friends with, or kind of related to. You never choose it, but it chooses you. Why? Location, location, location, and the lack of other viable options for party time-ish dinner in an area where that’s the thing.
Between the years of 2000-2014, we probably ate at La Bottega 15 times. You know those types of nights: Tiffany from work's birthday dinner, Jackie, your second cousin’s going away party, college friends from out of town who couldn't get into Buddakan. It was just one of those spots that was never exactly amazing, but always good enough to get by, and, in general, a fun time. The same all bodes true for La Bottega’s successor, La Sirena. It serves all the same purposes of its predecessor, but has slightly better food and a really really large, really hang-out able bar.La Sirena certainly has its flaws: the large space feels a little fancy-hotel-restaurant-sterile, it's extremely loud (to the point where you can't hear anyone at your table), and honestly, a lot of the food tastes like it was cooked in the same vat of tomato sauce. A tasty vat of sauce, but not the most interesting. While La Sirena may have Mario Batali’s name on it, know you shouldn't come in expecting a Babbo-level meal.
La Sirena is no masterpiece, but it’ll get the job done in the right situations. It’s good for big groups, a lot of the food is solid, there are multiple private dining rooms, and there's even plenty of outdoor/patio dining. That's more than most restaurants in this hood can offer."

",2.0,Japanese,Nakamura,7.3,"Imagine you have a favorite... yoga instructor. (Just go with it.) You always enjoyed yoga, but you tried different places and teachers, moving around like a yoga nomad. And then one day, you found this one instructor in a weird little new studio that happened to be right by your house, and you finally were like, ""OK I GET yoga now. This is cool. This is my spot."" And the rest was Downward Dog history.
Except. Imagine your little neighborhood spot suddenly decides it's going to rotate in new teachers every month or so, like some kind of Yoga Expo. Your reaction: thanks, but no thanks? As much as doing Bikram with some famous guy from Bali sounds exciting, you're probably never going to go back.
Turns out, after a few months, your prized instructor opens up their own spot. Everything's mostly the same, and there are even some fancy new features (better... mats?). But it's also a little out of the way, and although all the poses are the same, it's never exactly the same.In this hypothetical situation, Nakamura - a Lower East Side ramen spot - is that new studio. Ramen Lab, which we described as a religious experience when we first went, is that original studio. When it first opened, Ramen Lab was two guys, one always wearing a fedora, serving up light chicken-based ramen that was fairly transcendental. The noodles were great, but so was the funkiness of the place - the open kitchen, and the fact that you often had to stand while you ate. Ramen Lab has since transformed, and now plays host to a different famous ramen chef from a different part of the world every month or so. Cool as it sounds, the days and times it's open are unpredictable, and sometimes the whole place goes dark for weeks.
The two guys (fedora still included) are now at Nakamura, a little place on Delancey, right under the entrance to the Williamsburg Bridge. The original chicken ramen is there, and it's almost as good as we remember (there's a spicy version that is distinctly bad, though - do not order it). There are also some really good dumplings, and an interesting vegetarian ramen. That said, the magic isn't entirely there - without the open kitchen, the energy level is lower and it's just not quite as fun a place to eat as Ramen Lab.
So should you go out of your way to try Nakamura? If you're a dedicated ramen obsessive who particularly likes soups that aren't as heavy as those at Ippudo or Totto Ramen, it's a worthy bowl. It's also a great place for vegetarians who want to get down with some ramen. Otherwise, it depends how much you like yoga."

",3.0,Italian,Uva,7.3,"I wish more restaurants had slogans. Like, “Minetta Tavern - All The Meat That’s Fit To Eat,” or “Carbone - No, You Can’t Have Dinner Here.” It would really help give you a feel for a place before you experience it firsthand. To that end, if Uva, a popular Italian restaurant on the Upper East Side had a slogan, it would definitely be, “Uva - Don’t Be A Hero.”
Why? Because whatever plan you are cooking up for a really impressive date night at a hot new restaurant is probably going to fail. You aren’t going to get a reservation with such short notice, and even if you could, the restaurant is probably going to be too loud, or not loud enough, or too expensive, or too romantic, or not romantic enough, or Jesus, why does this have to be so hard, we’re just having dinner?
Don’t be a hero. Just go to Uva.
Uva is that restaurant that you turn to for date night when all else seems impossible. It’s a rustic, cozy little Italian spot in the East 70s that’s always lively and always full of other people just like you - people just who want a solid meal in a nice environment with someone they’re sizing up for breed-ability. The food is good - not the best Italian in the city, but certainly satisfying, and also somewhat reasonably priced. The wine list is affordable and not intimidating, and the menu is big enough that pretty much anyone can find something that suits their needs. There’s even a nice garden in the back for a pleasant evening, or a daytime date if you really want to keep things PG. It is worth noting that when crowded, Uva can be a bit loud, and it’s also very dark. But unless you’re planning on giving some sort of presentation at the table, that shouldn’t be an issue.
What that all adds up to is that by going with Uva for your next date, you can focus on what’s really important, and that’s being as impressive as any human can possibly be. So maybe that’s your slogan. “Don’t dress like an idiot.”
Uva will handle the rest."

",2.0,Chinese,Kings County Imperial,8.8,"If you spend time eating in New York, you’ll begin to collect a list of favorite Chinese restaurants - top spots for different cuisines, for different situations, in different boroughs. We don’t update these mental power rankings often, but then we had several meals at Kings County Imperial in Williamsburg, and it shot to the very top of the list.
This is a modern, incredibly satisfying approach to classic Chinese cooking with excellent takes on everything from dumplings both long and soupy, to spring rolls, to crispy garlic chicken, to mu shu duck. On top of excellent food, Kings County is a fun place to hang out: they make great cocktails and also have a nice outdoor/patio situation for warmer months. Dim sum brunch al fresco? We’re in.
Aside from being an inviting, accommodating, and friendly place to enjoy a meal, complete with cushy, circular red booths and lazy susans, the secret sauce at Kings County Imperial is the soy. The restaurant actually brews its own soy sauce, which is used in all the dishes on the menu. The sauce is sun-fermented in antique porcelain pots that sit in a Chinese field for 6-8 months, which apparently allows the soy to reach maximum flavor. Once it arrives at Kings County, they run it through a nitrogen line at the restaurant to prevent it from oxidizing too fast. It’s on tap at the bar, right next to the beers, and the negronis (also on tap, of course). It’s another example of the little details that add up to a great experience overall.
It’s time to turn the volume up on Kings County. If you are someone who likes Chinese food, dumplings, or an enjoyable dining experience amongst friends, then get to Kings County Imperial immediately."

",2.0,Pizza,Lil Frankie’s,8.5,"A while back, we invented a game. This game is called “Can Lil Frankie’s Fix Your Dining Dilemma?” The best thing about this game is that you almost always win.
Lil Frankie’s is not a restaurant you’ll see on a lot of “best of” lists on sites other than this one. But it is possibly the restaurant we recommend wholeheartedly most often - be it for a big, loud birthday or a quiet dinner for two. Pretty much whatever your situation, Lil Frankie’s pulls through.
Someone’s vegetarian? No problem. Someone’s just a generally picky eater? All good. Someone doesn’t want to spend much? Fine. It’s a big group and you want to make a reservation but you don’t want to put down a credit card because the number in your group may change, and putting down a credit card just generally seems annoying? It’s handled. Have to plan your friend’s birthday two days in advance? Shouldn’t be an issue. Brunch? Yes. Open until 2am? Yes. Need to impress some out of towners with a “great neighborhood spot”? It’ll do. Just feeling a little sh*tty about your week so far and want to fill your body with carbs and wine? Go to Lil Frankie’s. Are you tired of reading this yet? That’s the point. In an almost unbelievable number of situations, Lil Frankie’s has your back. And the more we realized that, the more we realized that the rating on this classic deserved a few more decimal points.But Lil Frankie’s is also more than just useful. The food - Neapolitan pizzas, nice salads, simple pastas, well-executed vegetables, and a few entrees - is consistently tasty, great for sharing, and always highly satisfying. The brick-walled space always has the right energy, and it’s highly versatile, too, whether you’re a small group in the front or a big party at a round table in the back. This is a key part of why we like Lil Frankie’s more than its sister restaurants Frank, Supper, and Sauce. The others also don’t serve pizza, which docks them a few more points.
Can Lil Frankie’s do it? The answer is probably yes."

What if it’s not as good? What if they don’t play rap music? Will they still have wine? These are the things that keep us up at night.
And there’s more to it than that. In the interest of full disclosure, you should know that we’ve also gotten to know the Charlie Bird people a little bit, not because we are trying to hang out with restaurant folk, but because every time we are in there, they are just so f*cking nice. It makes the situation slightly more complicated. We imagine it’s sort of like having your kid perform at her very first dance recital. You’re optimistic that she’ll nail her number, but you’re also very aware that you can’t be seen with her anymore if she screws it up.
Or maybe it’s not complicated at all. Because Pasquale Jones is Charlie Bird with pizza.We don’t mean to diminish the things that are unique about this new spot - it is different. Sort of. It’s a bit smaller than Charlie Bird, with bar seating along an open kitchen and two wood-burning ovens where many of the best things on this menu come from. But all of the good things about Charlie Bird have been packaged up and brought over to Pasquale Jones, and that’s what makes it an exceptional restaurant. The service is still excellent. The vibe is slightly upscale but relaxed. The wine list is varied and ranges in price from reasonable to highly unreasonable, and it’s one of the best you’ll find in this city. And while we haven’t heard much hip hop over the span of our many recent visits, the music is still good, too.
These are the things that this Charlie Bird/Pasquale Jones crew has figured out that so many other restaurateurs still haven’t. Yes, the pizza is fantastic, but there is a lot of great pizza in this town. It’s getting all of the other details right that makes a restaurant special. That, and not staffing the place with assholes.
Before you visit, know that following the Food Rundown below will lead you to the highest ratio of success. We actually like the food at Pasquale Jones a bit more than we do at Charlie Bird because pizza, but most anything from the wood-burning oven will be good. And make sure to drink a bottle of wine.

",3.0,American,Estela,8.8,"When Estela opened in 2013, people that get excited about restaurants got really excited. It quickly became one of the hippest places in the country to eat small quantities of food, and everyone wanted in - even Obama. The President’s visit definitely did more for his reputation than for Estela’s. By that time, Estela didn’t even need the help.
And while we liked Estela a lot when we first reviewed it, we just couldn’t fully back it. The small plates were great, but it was too uncomfortable (with its small tables, high volume, and general claustrophobia vibes) to be a useful restaurant for most situations.
But enough about history. Let’s live in the present. And presently, we have no more tolerance for uncomfortable dining situations than we did three years ago. In fact, we now have even less patience for having to dramatically over-enunciate so our friends can hear us, or sitting on a chair that’s only big enough for one butt cheek. Which is why we feel the need to tell you that Estela is now fully worthy of your time. The crowds (and the discomfort that comes with them) have eased up just slightly, and the best aspects of the food have gotten even better. Estela has evolved into a classic restaurant we’ll tell our friends to go to.You know that feeling you get in great restaurants, when you just know instinctively that you’re in capable hands? That’s what Estela feels like. The food is as creative as it is tasty, so much so that we were legitimately sad to get to the end of one plate, only to get just as excited about what was going to show up on our table next. The beef carpaccio is probably the best we’ve ever had - every bite is such a perfect mix of raw steak and crispy bits (Sunchoke? Onion? Potato chip? Impossible to tell, but it doesn’t matter.) that you forget you’re eating raw meat. And suddenly, a pile of burrata on top of charred bread swimming in a moat of green juice just makes so much sense - why would you want to eat burrata any other way? 
Considering how small the place is, they manage to pack in a ton of action without descending into total chaos. Sit at the bar for optimal people watching, or reserve a table on the other side of the restaurant for a slightly more formal experience. We even had luck walking in recently around 7pm on a Friday and getting seated immediately. Despite all its trendiness, and all its press, the experience at Estela remains a casual one – while you could use it for a special occasion, it feels much more suited for a regular night out.
Another big reason Estela’s been heavy in our rotation lately: brunch. Just when we were ready to cut the cord on paying $16 for anything having to do with eggs, Estela swooped right in to serve the kind worth getting out of bed for on a Sunday. The sweet, savory, highly memorable breakfast sandwich would be reason enough to go, but here’s the real kicker: they take brunch reservations.
So yes, Estela is still a little too loud, and a little too cramped, and a little too crowded. But it’s also great enough that you’ll most likely be able to forgive it for those things. So f*ck that line that wraps around the block for ridiculous milkshakes or rainbow bagels – Estela is an actually good reason to get a little uncomfortable."

",2.0,Thai,Lovely Day,7.4,"There's something that happens a lot at The Infatuation: people ask us not to write certain restaurant reviews.
The restaurants in question are never new hot spots, or places with a chef that anyone's heard of. Instead, they're usually reliable, affordable neighborhood spots - the kinds of places you can stop into for an impromptu Tuesday night or Sunday night dinner. 
Places like Lovely Day.
In fact, probably a dozen people have asked us not to write about Lovely Day, begging that we not ""blow up their spot,"" which might make us seem like assholes right about now. But after eating here about 100 times over the past five or so years, it seemed time. So here goes.
Lovely Day is a little cafe on Elizabeth Street in Nolita, serving Thai food, or at least Thai-ish food. It's a funky spot, with wallpaper that belongs in a dollhouse and tiny red leather booths and an old-timey cash register behind the bar.
The food is definitely not highly authentic or highly complex, but it is highly satisfying, almost in the way a great bodega egg and cheese is. The pad thai and the fried chicken and the green curry are always reliable: never too greasy or too sweet. Think of it as Thai comfort food. But the biggest draw is that it's highly inexpensive: hardly anything is over $10. That goes for the drinks too: there's even a full bar, and the cocktails are pretty cheap as well.Lovely Day draws a ""cool"" crowd. On any given night, most tables are filled with people who look like they work at an indie film production company and own an impressive collection of distressed vintage jean jackets. If this means anything to you, the owners of Dimes apparently met while working here.
There's often a wait at peak times, but since we've already committed to blowing up Lovely Day's spot, here's another secret: there's a second dining room downstairs. They won't tell you about it upstairs, but if you go back outside and down the stairs on the left, you can try your luck down there. The waiting lists are separate, but everything else is exactly the same.
Simply put, Lovely Day is one of the cheapest downtown Manhattan restaurants where you can still feel like you've had a fun night out. Where you can have a plate of good food and a cocktail, in a cool environment, and get out for a little over $20. Forgive us for thinking everyone deserves to know about that."

We all knew this was coming at one point or another. Now that the economy is better, your brother has left for college, and Mom finally understands that Uber isn’t an elaborate kidnapping service, a trip to Williamsburg for dinner with some friends suddenly isn’t such a daunting proposition for good old Rob and Sandy.But even despite all of those factors, one key thing has been missing - a restaurant in this part of Brooklyn that your parents actually wanted to go to. Not anymore. Now there’s Lilia.
To be fair, Lilia isn’t really a restaurant for parents. But it is definitely the most grown up restaurant in Williamsburg. The space - once an auto body shop - is huge and impressive and upscale yet comfortable, like L’Artusi or Il Buco Alimentari. The food is grown up, too. In the kitchen is Missy Robbins, who you might either know from her previous restaurant, A Voce, or from the time that you read somewhere that she’s Obama’s favorite chef. The menu is Italian in nature, full of pastas and vegetables and seafood dishes that are very good and also very professionally executed. Put it all together and what you end up with is a destination restaurant - one that is on the radar of people who wouldn’t otherwise find themselves in Williamsburg.
We definitely find ourselves in Williamsburg from time to time, and we were immediately impressed with Lilia. Over the span of about five different visits, we’ve found it to be consistently excellent, especially if you know how to order (see, Food Rundown). And while it’s definitely a destination restaurant, Lilia has a neighborhood vibe, too. The service is friendly and accommodating, and the bar is a great hang for a drink or dinner with a friend. There’s even a little cafe off to the side that serves casual lunch items for people who live and work around the area.
So yes, you might accidentally run into your mom at Lilia, and you probably won’t run into that guy that your friend was dating who does “artistic welding” for a living. Maybe that means Williamsburg is changing. Or maybe your parents are."

",3.0,American,Acme,6.7,"Here are some of the things we saw while waiting for a table at Acme on our last visit:
A woman in open-toed shoes, despite the fact that a two-day blizzard had just ended. An Italian man wearing what appeared to be three button-down shirts on top of each other. A Scandinavian-looking male model who asked three women at the bar if they would like to try his Aperol Spritz. People watching-wise, things were off to a good start.
And then we sat down. Next to a guy wearing a one-piece white ski suit with rainbow-colored detailing. Damn.
Acme is the People Watching Olympics.Once upon a time, food was actually the main draw at Acme. When we first went a few years back, Acme was doing pretty novel things: they'd revamped an old divey Cajun restaurant/music venue in Noho, and brought in one of the chefs from Noma in Copenhagen to cook some pretty serious ""New Nordic"" cuisine. Foam was involved, and there was a section of the menu devoted to ""soil."" And for some time, it was pretty excellent. I mean, the guy's name was Mads Refslund. You know that's gonna be good.
Eventually, the hype died down, things slipped a bit, and the sceney, sweaty, hard-to-get-into club below the restaurant became the main draw. (Maybe try wearing a white one-piece ski suit to get in?) Anyway, the chef eventually left, which brings us to today. The menu has been revamped, and it's now pretty straightforward Italian/modern American food: vegetables, seafood, pasta, chicken, steak, all in a variety you've seen before at every trendy hotel restaurant across major cities of America. Do you like restaurants like The Standard Grill and Gemma? If so, you'll probably enjoy it here - just know this place is no longer really about the food.
Considering the scene, the new menu was probably a wise move: this is food for people-watching people."

",4.0,Japanese,O Ya,7.6,"Do you love sushi? Are you rich? If you answered yes to both of those questions, pay attention. If you're pretty normal as it pertains to cash money, but enjoy a splurge on fancy fish every once in a while, then bank this info for future celebrations. If neither of those situations pertains to you, feel free to stop reading now.
O Ya is a Boston import, and its chef is known for being about as good of a fish slicer, dicer, and blowtorcher as you can find, so it's no surprise that O Ya is serving highly intricate, next-level raw fish.
The sushi here is not traditional or simple - it's pretty different from even the more modern sushi places you'll find in New York. Along with your toro and salmon, you'll eat things like hamachi topped with banana pepper, and even some chicken skin nigiri. Speaking about the food alone, this is sushi that easily competes with the best of New York City conversation.And there's more good news. For one, you can pretty much get a table at O Ya whenever you want. So, if you need a sushi celebration in a pinch, or your boss is demanding a last-minute reservation at Nakazawa (which obviously won't happen), you now know your backup plan. O Ya also abandoned the tasting-menu-only model it opened with, so now it’s a bit more approachable, if you're interested in a smaller meal. The a la carte setup means that posting up at the bar to eat as many of their absurdly good tea-brined fried pork ribs as your wallet can endure is suddenly an option. However, if you really want to experience O Ya properly, the $185 omakase will always be the way to go. 
Unfortunately, there's also some bad news: O Ya's poor location in a random Murray Hill hotel and impossible price point make it a tough destination to fully back. While we're into luxury fish in a low-key setting, when you're shelling out at minimum $200 a head, it feels like something is missing from the experience.  Maybe it's the fact that a lot of the dishes are cooked in the back, out of sight, or the fact that the sushi bar feels a little sterile.
We don’t need a spectacle, but for that kind of money, we do want to feel special. The food is great, but O Ya is missing that personal touch that inspires return visits. It's missing the magic.
If we were rich, O Ya might be in our regular rotation. Unfortunately, we’re not (yet!), and we'd way rather spend half as much money at a place like Kura or Tanoshi."

",2.0,Southern,Sylvia's Restaurant,7.0,"When Sylvia's chef and founder Sylvia Woods died in 2012, W. 126th Street and Lenox Avenue in Harlem was co-named ""Sylvia P. Woods Way."" When you get an entire block named after you in New York City, you’re pretty much immortal. And Sylvia's is about as immortal a restaurant as you'll find in New York City.
Sylvia's opened in the 1960s, and it's been Harlem's most iconic Southern soul food mecca ever since. It's evolved and expanded over the years - the restaurant now takes up the entire block between 126th and 127th on Malcolm X Blvd and has multiple dining rooms, a diner counter, and a separate lounge that all together seat around 450 people. There’s also a Sylvia’s product line of BBQ sauces available in grocery stores, and a catering business. Needless to say, Sylvia's children and grandchildren have been keeping busy.The food, simply put, is incredibly satisfying. It may not be as mind-bogglingly good as the soul food you’ll find down south, but for NYC this will absolutely do the trick. Sweet, falling off the bone ribs, crispy fried chicken, catfish, all the sides, giant slices of pie… you get the picture. It’s loud, it’s low-key, and there’s always a lot of action to take in. Even though service tends to be slow and not overly attentive, they make up for it with friendly, happy employees.
Before you start eating at all the trendy new spots in Harlem, paying respects and filling your belly at Sylvia’s needs to happen first. Obama has eaten here, pre-vegan Bill Clinton has eaten here, as has pretty much every other big name who has blown through Harlem. On our last trip here, we sat at a table next to Busta Rhymes. Woo-Hah!, place your fried chicken where my eyes can see."

",2.0,Cafe/Bakery,Two Hands,7.9,"Let’s start here: Two Hands is one of those coffee shops that everyone posts Instagrams from. If you pay attention to such things, this is very old news to you, as this laid back cafe was one of the early beneficiaries of the photogenic food movement on social media. Pretty pictures of avocado toast turned out to be a pretty successful way to bring people to your food establishment, and by people we mean young people. Come to Two Hands on a bank holiday, and the place basically looks like the crowded lunchroom of an affluent high school. In Melbourne. For models.But Celine bags and smartphones aside, there is actually a much bigger reason that Two Hands has become so successful, and it all boils down to one thing - Australians. The place is run by and filled with Aussies, and that’s a great thing. Why? Think about it this way. Have you ever met a mean Australian? Seriously. Find me one Aussie that isn’t the friendliest f*cking person in the room, and I’ll  buy you a domesticated miniature koala. Because guess what? Neither of those things exist.
That’s why Two Hands has basically become the Infatuation’s satellite office. Since moving our HQ down to the neighborhood, it’s become our go-to spot for meetings, breakfasts, lunches, and afternoon coffee runs, mostly because the people here are so friendly. The food is solid and the coffee drinks are excellent, and that matters, too. But we keep coming back because it’s basically the opposite of Dimes - a place where you can walk in off the street and be treated well while you eat your acai bowl, regardless of who you are. Even if you’re only there to take a picture of it."

",3.0,Cafe/Bakery,Dimes,6.2,"We discovered Dimes a few years ago, right about the time we and everyone else discovered that there was more city below Canal on the Lower East Side and not just an infinity edge into the East River.
In its original incarnation on Division Street, Dimes was a small cafe full of dudes with man buns and probably also trust funds eating acai bowls. We liked it for its quirkiness and quality food and frequented it fairly often.
Then, as timing would have it, both healthy food and man buns became the hottest trends since techno became “EDM,” and Dimes had to move up the block to a larger space to meet demand. That’s when things got weird.
The food at Canal Street Dimes is the same as it was on Division Street, but nowadays, the vibe is different. Around this new location has coalesced a group of people whom we now refer to exclusively as the “Dimes Community.” These people frequent Dimes and other cool places around the Lower East Side and Chinatown, like the yoga place down the street from Dimes that also probably serves acai bowls, that coffee shop inside the skateboard shop, and Nicaragua. You are not one of them.
And that’s just the problem. Every time we’ve walked into Dimes over the last year or so, we’ve gotten the same look from the staff as you might if you picked a random house on the street and walked into the kitchen during dinner. “Who are you? We don’t know you. Why are you here? Are you a friend of Amanda’s?”
It’s a place that’s often uncomfortable due to the cold service that comes with your cold acai bowl, and as a result, we’ve crossed Dimes off of our list of frequently visited restaurants. The food is still very good, should you find yourself curious to try it. But whatever you do, don’t let on that you’re not a part of the community. Tell them you know Amanda."

",3.0,Peruvian,Llama Inn,8.8,"If New York City were populated by animals rather than people, a bunch of llamas would definitely live in Williamsburg. Have you ever seen a llama? They’re tall and gangly, often look like they have dumb haircuts, and have an extra letter in their name you suspect might be ironic. Sure, Lleonard, I’m sure that’s just what your parents named you.
So it seems like it would be fitting that right under the BQE on the northern side of Williamsburg, you’ll find a restaurant called Llama Inn.
Thing is, if we’re speaking in broad strokes stereotypes here, Llama Inn is more like the hot exchange student in a '90s comedy: extremely beautiful and a little exotic considering the surroundings, but also really kind and charming. When Llama Inn walks into the room, heads turn.
The space is incredibly designed - there’s artwork made out of yarn covering one wall, multi-colored textile lampshades hanging from the ceiling, and plants dangling over the tops of the floor-to-ceiling windows surrounding the whole space. This isn’t Architectural Digest, but we’ll summarize: this place looks very cool.The food is Peruvian, or at least Peruvian-inspired, and it’s all highly tasty. It’s a place to get adventurous if you want, with beef heart skewers and goat’s neck, but it’s also a people pleaser of a restaurant, with some roast chicken and ceviche ready and waiting. We actually ate our way through the menu with some friends who grew up in Peru, and while no one thought it was exactly an authentic taste of home, everyone agreed the food all tasted good. By the way, if you’re looking to take a trip to somewhere with amazing restaurants, go to Lima ASAP. In two days, we had four of the best meals we’ve ever had.
As for why and when you should take a trip to Llama Inn? The large amount of bar-style seating around the whole restaurant makes it extremely well-suited to a date or one-on-one dinner, and there are only a few bigger tables. That said, the large format items, which you definitely need more than two people to finish, are some of the best things on the menu. Either way, you can have a good meal here with one person or six.
However you choose to classify Llama Inn - date spot, location of your next birthday party, setting for your now-imagined fantasy zoo version of New York City - know that it’s a place you should strongly consider visiting."

",3.0,French,Le Turtle,8.7,"My first thought when having dinner at Le Turtle for the first time? That this restaurant is Underfinger, but for real.
For those of you who might be unfamiliar, Underfinger is a restaurant review that we wrote in 2014 for a restaurant that doesn’t actually exist - though its characteristics definitely did at the time in the New York dining scene. It was a joke with some truth behind it, but a joke nonetheless.
Now that you have that context, imagine us, sitting at our table at Le Turtle, a somewhat mysterious new restaurant from the people behind The Smile and Freemans, eating a plate of charcuterie called “Ends Meat,” served to us by a waitress wearing what can only be described as a prison jumpsuit from the future. Around us are tables that may or may not be made of plywood, each occupied by a group of very cool looking people who are the kind of individuals who take cigarette breaks during dinner. There is also some sort of VIP booth that sits a foot off the floor near the bar, kind of like a cage for hungry gogo dancers, or exotic animals at a zoo for animals that love to party. On the menu are dishes like “Kabocha Squash with Fresh Cheese,” “Whole Sasso Chicken for Two with Bitter Greens, Sorrel, and Pumpkin Vinaigrette,” and “Grilled Wagyu with Japanese Sweet Potato, Persillade, and Nasturtium Soubise.” Kind of sounds like a joke, doesn’t it?
Here’s the thing - it most definitely isn’t.
Despite all of the weird quirks at Le Turtle, from their insane website, to the menu full of probably made up things, to the fact that the restaurant won’t let us take pictures of the interior, Le Turtle is a place we keep coming back to. Why?Because whatever it is that they are doing, they’re doing it right. The food, though often unfamiliar, is regularly excellent and at the very worst, interesting. The service is professional, friendly, and welcoming, flying in the face of the “how to run a cool restaurant” handbook. The wine list is unique and full of bottles you’ll want to take a picture of so you can drink them again. And somehow, even though it’s a sceney place, Le Turtle feels like a neighborhood hang. It’s a restaurant that is as good a destination for a laid back Tuesday night dinner with your friend as it is for the next Fashion Week party you won’t get into. And that’s a sentence I never thought I’d write seriously.
I guess the joke’s on us."

To snooze your alarm seven times every morning, to Seamless the exact same thing to your apartment multiple times a week, to listen to the same thing at the gym every time you go because you’re too lazy to come up with a new playlist. There’s nothing wrong with sticking to the familiar.But sometimes, our routines get totally shaken up. We realize that if we order the Maki Combo from Sushi Tokyo II one more time, we may never be able to eat a spicy tuna roll again. Or we realize that we don’t actually hate quiche.Which is exactly what happened to us at Timna, where there’s something really exciting happening to Israeli food. This isn’t the kind place where you can fall back on your usual hummus and falafel habits. This is a place where you come to try something different, in the form of Israeli fusion.Timna is really only “Israeli” in the sense that it uses common Israeli elements in its dishes. So yes, there’s tzatziki, but it’s in a dish featuring raw tuna and quinoa. And that’s what Timna does best: it takes dishes that have been done to death, combines them with something unexpected, and turns them into something else entirely. Bread isn’t just bread - it comes to the table in a flower pot. And we had no idea we wanted a Chinese-Italian salad in an allegedly Israeli restaurant until we ate one.Timna’s space is a little one in the East Village, with enough red brick and air plants to look hip enough for your Friday night plans, but casual enough that you can roll in after work for an easy Tuesday night dinner. We are, however, obligated to tell you that Timna can be a bit of a sh*tshow. Waits are crazy, service is kind of absent, and we may or may not have had a light fixture fall onto our table. And yet, despite all of that, the food is good enough that we will happily return. Besides, lightning (or a light fixture) can’t strike twice, right?So the next time you’re in the mood to try something new, we’d suggest you get to Timna. Just be warned – it might become a habit."

When Atomic Wings are widely considered the best in town, it's clear there are big problems. The door was wide open for someone to step up, we're just surprised it took this long. People of Infatuation Nation, meet Dan & John's, who we're officially crowning King of Wings in NYC. 
I'm infatuated with buffalo wings, will travel to great lengths to eat them, and believe strongly there is no better camaraderie-building cuisine. So believe me when I say: Dan & John's are the best buffalo wings in NYC. They may not be on the level of Westchester's Candlelight, but I haven't been happier eating anything in the last year than I have eating D&J's wings.There's nothing fancy here: no schtick, no bells, no whistles, no exotic sauces or Asian flavors. Just textbook execution. The First Avenue location, which started out as a Smorgasburg stall, is just a storefront with a couple stools, and while we wish there was more space to enjoy the wings live and make a mess of ourselves, beggars really can't be choosers. Plus, these wings deliver and travel incredibly well.
Dan & John's provides salvation for all of us wing deprived obsessives who've all but forgotten how glorious it is to dive face first into a steamy bowl of hot wings. Get down, make love. (Yes, that’s a Nine Inch Nails reference)."

We wound up here after a show, already buzzed and feeling fantastic about life, and left blindsided by a perfect Caesar salad and spectacular pasta and potatoes. You know that feeling where it sort of feels like you're on drugs, but you're actually just experiencing the EEEEEATS on another level? That's the feeling we left with. We were at exactly the right place at exactly the right time. Needless to say, it was a good night. And, promise, our serotonin levels were fully normal.We went back to make sure we weren't just drunk the first time through and, nope, we weren't - Prospect is awesome. The food is way more advanced in technique than it may appear on the menu, and it's clear that the kitchen takes things seriously, without being pretentious. Jalapeño Purée creates a moat around their Peruvian pork spare ribs, and calamari is served over smoked potatoes - one of the most glorious combinations ever. The drinks too; tremendous. It's rare you find surprises like this anymore.
While every neighborhood needs a Prospect-type restaurant - a laid-back, hang-out-all-night-long type of setting with an exciting, always changing menu and nice people - Prospect shouldn't just be thought of as a locals-only spot. It's worth traveling for, and is easily one of the best dining options nearby BAM and Barclays.

Defonte’s doesn’t do its take on a classic. Defonte’s is the classic.
No frills, yes turkey gravy.This place, which has been open since 1922, is a deli, not a restaurant – no tables, no waiters – but the menu goes way beyond your normal spread of cold cuts. Between the trays of parmigiana and house-brined meats, you can legitimately come to Defonte’s for three meals a day without repeating the same taste twice.
We wrote that sentence and instantly realized how true it was that we set out to prove it: we started with the egg and potato on a sesame seed roll for breakfast, moved over to the Italian combo with extra hot peppers for lunch, and finished off strong with an eggplant parm for dinner. It was one of our best days of eating in a long time and we didn’t even go as big as we could have (see: the Giuseppe Special).

Essential in the sense that it offers something – or a combination of things – you can’t get anywhere else. And Suzume does exactly that. Holler at us if you know of any other place that serves sushi AND ramen AND tacos AND wings, because this is a revelation. Add to that its charming space, reasonable prices, and solid cocktail selection and Suzume is a true restaurant anomaly.
Despite all of those ANDs, Suzume packs a lot of good things into a surprisingly concise menu. There are a few sushi options, a few “snacks” (tacos, wings), a few bowls of ramen, and a few other items just in case you’re the hardest person in New York to please. As for prices - the most expensive thing on the menu is $11. The addition of a great drinks list also makes Suzume a place where you can have a gin-beet-carrot-apple-ginger cocktail while eating a spicy tuna roll and feel neither like you’re at a spa nor Tao. What this all boils down to is a happiness free-for-all – no matter how or what you order, it’s going to be good, and it’s going to be fun.Suzume also gets major points for its atmosphere. It’s a tiny space, but it’s simultaneously cool enough for a date and comfortable enough for a weeknight solo dinner. And while we’ve encountered slight waits for a table, getting in is never a production.  
Ultimately, Suzume is not a place you come because you want the best sushi or ramen in the city. It’s a place you come because it fulfills all your needs in one fell swoop, with its quirky yet accessible menu, reasonable prices, and feel-good vibes. And that, in itself, is a real rarity. Suzume may not be on everyone’s list of essential restaurants, but if you’re anywhere near this part of Brooklyn it should be on yours."

The hype is real, and the food is excellent.
So what’s the concept? It’s a steakhouse disguised in restaurant trends.
The reality of the city we live in right now is that nobody really wants or needs another down-the-middle steak place. People are eating less meat these days, and even the business bros would rather take their clients somewhere cool like The Clocktower or Upland over Strip House or BLT Prime. So if you want to sell some steaks, how do you trick people into going to a steak restaurant? You wrap it up in every of-the-moment restaurant trend you can think of. And what you end up with is Quality Eats.The interesting thing is that, while this all might sound very contrived, Quality Eats is a concept executed perfectly. The restaurant feels like a perfect amalgamation of all the best parts of Employees Only, Jacks Wife Freda, and Raoul’s. It’s a dark, vibey restaurant with a huge bar and excellent cocktails, a playlist mix of current and classic like The Weeknd and David Bowie, and a huge list of craft beer and interesting wines. As for the menu, there are most definitely steaks – but there is also a myriad of other less meaty, more photogenic options, like roasted beet tabouleh and hamachi crudo. But the smartest thing coming out of the kitchen might also be the most absurd – a full dessert menu of “Dressed Up” ice cream scoops, including one topped with what can only be described as birthday cake croutons, and another called “This Sh*t Is Bananas.” It is bananas indeed. And it’s exactly the kind of thing that will get people walking in off the street from Instagram.
To sum it up with one statement, the best thing we can think of to tell you is that Quality Eats is by CHLOE for people who don’t care what their body looks like. It’s fun, boozy, rich, and it’s not going to help you get to your spin class in the morning. But it will get you eating steak again, and maybe that was the whole point.

It’s a tiny spot all the way over on Avenue C that’s much nicer on the inside than you’d expect it to be, and much more polished in terms of menu than pretty much anything else in the area. It’s a serious restaurant that serves serious food, like rillettes and risotto and scallop dishes that you’d more likely find at an upscale restaurant that your dad is really into than you would in the far East Village.We like Virginia’s a lot, mostly thanks to our previously stated desire to go big from time to time. But it also took us a bunch of visits to come around. When the restaurant first opened, we found the food to be a bit inconsistent, and the service was (and still can be) a little awkward at times. Things have definitely stabilized lately, and Virginia’s also smartly put a burger on their menu to appease the more casual weekday diner.

And then there was the time we walked in with a friend on a Saturday night and ended up taking shots of an Italian liqueur with the bartender and a guy who lives in the apartment upstairs.All of this is to say: Epistrophy, an Italian-ish cafe in Nolita, is useful in many situations. It’s a great place to grab a drink or have a casual low-stakes dinner, while the large tables up front (which you can reserve) are a good move when you’re tasked with planning a eight person dinner on a Saturday night that’s actually reasonably priced, fun, and with food everyone will like.

What a relief.So next time you find yourself needing to plan a drinks meeting/date/lunch/last minute gathering of six people in this part of town, you know what to do."

",2.0,Korean,Turntable Chicken Jazz,7.5,"There’s a lot of cool sh*t that goes on in K-Town these days that you need to know about, most of which happens out of sight on second floors. What, you didn’t realize some of the better Korean fried chicken in NYC is through a dumpy pizza joint entrance on 5th Ave. and 31st? Well, now you know. Welcome to Turntable Chicken Jazz.
Turntable is kind of like K-Town’s version of TGI Fridays meets Justin Timberlake’s Southern Hospitality. So it’s by no means a traditional Korean dining experience. Nope. They serve cucumber martinis and pitchers of beer in steaming, neon vats; they have a DJ booth and vinyl records all over the walls; and they bang lots of Bieber on the sound system. It’s somehow not too cheesy, though. It’s not not cheesy, but even despite all of the above characteristics, Turntable is not only a place we approve of, but are excited to come back to. And let’s be real, the more Bieber the better. You don’t even have to feel ashamed anymore.Turntable serves crowd-pleasing, modernized Korean fare that’s impossible not to enjoy. Think next-level Bonchon (if you’re unfamiliar, the McDonald’s of Korean fried chicken). The fried chicken wings, served either spicy or sweet and sour, are the reason you’re coming here. The rest of the menu, which includes an Instagram-worthy sword made of thinly sliced fried potatoes (on a stick!) and an awesome bulgogi burger, is just as satisfying.
Turntable Chicken is one of the most fun restaurants in K-Town. It’s great for big groups and a solid spot for dining around Madison Square Garden and Penn Station.
And remember: just because you can’t see it from the street doesn’t mean it ain’t there."

",3.0,Italian,L’Amico,7.6,"The term “scarcity” gets used a lot in the world of economics, and according to my state school education, the definition is when the value of a resource is determined by its availability in relation to how many people want or need it. Let’s apply that concept to this review.
Here, the resource is “a restaurant that isn’t awful near Penn Station,” and according to the amount of times we get asked about such a thing every day, there are a whole lot of people who want or need it. L’Amico takes great economic advantage of some scarcity.
Not that there aren’t other restaurants in this area - this is actually the second dining establishment to open in the lobby of the Eventi Hotel, also home to Lupulo. But scarcity isn’t about how many restaurants there are in a certain area. It’s about how many good ones there are. And Lupulo just isn’t very good.
L’Amico, however, is very good, and whoever conceptualized this restaurant is very familiar with both what the average New Yorker wants, and what this part of town definitely does not have - an aestethically pleasing restaurant that serves food that people like to eat. Like pasta. And pizza. And gelato. I also seem to remember from my state school economics class that anytime you replace a vowel with an apostrophe in the name of a business, revenues increase by 28%. It’s called the L’Artusi law.
That said, value correlates with availability, and if you were to put L’Amico in another part of town where restaurants with apostrophes in their names are in no short supply, it wouldn’t be so valuable. While the food here is definitely good, and the room is visually appealing, it gets extremely cramped during dinner hours. The bar is also very small and serves mediocre cocktails, and for some reason the dinner crowd consists mostly of Upper East Side women who look up to Bethenny Frankel and dress like Indiana Jones when they go out.
Our advice would be to use it whenever you find yourself in need of something near Penn Station that won’t make you sad, or anytime you can get out of your Midtown office in the middle of the day for a proper meal and maybe a glass of wine - L’Amico is at its best during lunch.
Then again, an occasion like that might be scarce, too."

",2.0,American,Gotan,7.9,"A neighborhood café should have a few things, at minimum: good coffee, WiFi, and passable pastries. A good neighborhood café has space to spread out, and probably a decent chicken sandwich. Add a truly killer breakfast sandwich, fancy avocado toast, big windows, and even some highly tasty salads? You’ve got yourself a great neighborhood café.
Gotan, located in a big corner space outside the Franklin Street stop in Tribeca, is a great neighborhood café. In the style of places like Two Hands or Little Collins, Gotan is kind of a Coffee Shop Plus, serving fresh, simple breakfast and lunch food until the early evening. It’s not a place for boozy brunch and stacks of pancakes, but it is the kind of place that makes you actually want to go out for a weekday breakfast.
It isn’t the tourists-on-Instagram haven that some of its peers are, but Gotan definitely cares about aesthetics. For example, the staff all wear bowties (somehow it’s not pretentious), and the oatmeal is decorated like a fancy açai bowl. You order at the counter, but a waiter brings your food to your seat, on a real plate. They’re small touches, but they mean a lot.
Looks aside, the main reason we’re highlighting Gotan in a sea of neighborhood cafés is for its food, which is very, very good across the board - and original. The cheesy scrambled eggs on a biscuit is one of the best breakfast sandwiches around, and dishes like the eggplant flatbread, which is more like a dip, are unusual and highly satisfying. Some of the dishes have some Middle Eastern influence, but overall the menu is basically “modern cafe.”
Gotan is more of a neighborhood hang than a destination, but if you’ve spent any time living, working, or visiting expensive children’s clothing stores around this area, you know it’s a godsend. There are plenty of great sit-down restaurants nearby, but a big space to spread out with your laptop, a cup of coffee, and a light lunch, all for about $15 a person, that’s something good. Something great, even."

",3.0,American,The Ribbon,8.2,"Attention restaurateurs: the Upper West Side is famished, starving for anything that resembles a cool downtown restaurant. More than any other Manhattan neighborhood, the UWS has been neglected. Badly. And judging by the level of human enjoyment at The Ribbon so far, you guys are missing out on a GOLD MINE.Dip into The Ribbon on a Saturday night, and you’ll see what we’re talking about. Blue Ribbon’s first Upper West Side outpost is banging like 50 Cent’s “In Da Club"" days. It’s overflowing with people, and, more importantly, happiness. People simply can’t believe they finally have a better option than the so-so stuff they’ve been surviving on locally for so long, especially for dinner.The Ribbon is smart, too. Their menu, like the restaurant itself, is massive, and is built to please pretty much anyone. At brunch, lunch, and dinner, they serve the classics with enough of a twist to make the food stand out. Its flexibility makes it the perfect location for any number of occasions: on one hand, The Ribbon is a great place to come early with kids, but it’s also the perfect spot to watch college football during the day at the bar, or to visit for a night out on the town with a big group. Recently we were lucky enough to land the private room, which has one of the best round tables in all of Manhattan. There’s an old rock ’n roll jukebox, TVs at the bar that don’t interfere with the rest of the dining experience, and an impressive assortment of brown liquor. Service is on point, and overall, it’s just a really fun place to hang out.The Ribbon has a lot of style, and plenty of substance. It’s essentially a classier, more upscale version of The Smith. If you live up here, check it out. If you don’t live up here, now you can travel north to go out with your friends who do, without having to settle for slop.I’m ending this review the way I started it, but this time I’m going to yell.

",3.0,American,Jams,4.5,"There are two different ways to look at Jams, the Midtown re-vamp of celebrity chef Jonathan Waxman's alleged 80's ""hit"" restaurant nobody was clamoring for. If you look at it through the lens of someone who's tuned into the world of chefs, restaurants, and the expectations that come along with big time openings, then Jams is an unmitigated disaster. Jonathan Waxman is a big name and a great chef. Barbuto was pioneering, and remains one of New York's most cherished restaurants; we went recently, and everything we ate was fantastic. Jams, on other hand, is a hot mess. The service is amateur hour, the food is about as exciting as wearing a suit to work in the sweaty summer, and they pretty much miss the mark on all ""hospitality"" details. Servers were like ghosts who left dirty plates on the table for the entire meal, never refilled waters, and generally didn't seem to care that paying customers sat in seats, hungry and potentially looking for another alcoholic beverage. Some of the food is fine, but it's nothing worth going out of your way for, and some of it is very, very bad. We had inedible gnocchi (how is that even possible?). I hope Jonathan Waxman is home counting cookbook money or cooking at his great new restaurant in Nashville, because it'd be really embarrassing if he was actually in the kitchen at Jams, and not just the face of it. If we were ranking Jams solely based on the failure of one of the biggest restaurant openings of the year, it would be awarded a 2.0. In that respect, this place is a joke. On the other hand, this is Midtown. There are plenty of people in this part of town in desperate need of reasonable restaurants, who don't really care who the chef is or how good the food is supposed to be. Sometimes you're just looking for a centrally located, stylish place to entertain a client who's in town from Tampa. For Midtown business meetings where food and restaurant experience isn't the main focus, well, Jams is a pretty solid option. If we were ranking Jams solely on a scale of Midtown, it gets a 7.0. Ultimately, Jams is kind of like the restaurant version of a Men's Wearhouse suit. If you care about style at all, you wouldn't be caught dead rocking one. However, if you simply couldn't care less - and seriously, BLESS YOU - and are content rocking that baggy, boxy uniform, well then, you won't be bothered by Jams' shortcomings. Lucky for us, we don't have to wear suits to the office."

",3.0,Japanese,Ushiwakamaru,7.8,"Sushi enthusiasts in New York tend to have a go-to spot. You love Sushi Of Gari? You probably lived on the Upper East Side at some point and don’t worry too much about your monthly credit card bill. You’re always at Momoya? You probably live in one of those big buildings in Chelsea and definitely have a favorite teacher at SoulCycle. You’re a regular at Sushi Yasuda? You’re either a celebrity or someone who’s had a personal food blog since 2006 – either way, you love that the chefs here know you by name.
So who goes to Ushiwakamaru? For decades, Ushiwakamaru had two main draws: 1) It was more under the radar than the city’s other best sushi spots, located in an almost dingy, but charming hole-in-the wall space on West Houston. 2) It was less expensive. The crowd was harder to pin down and make sweeping generalizations about, but the sushi was always top notch, and that meant a dedicated following.
And now you can forget all – or at least most of – that.
After a long run in Soho, Ushiwakamaru has moved to West Chelsea, and after checking out the new digs, we can report that things are different now. First, the space is bigger, and fancier, with a very long sushi bar. It’s nicer, but also feels a bit less homey, and more sterile. Second, it’s more expensive. The omakase, which is now required if you sit at the bar, starts at $100 for 14 pieces. The simpler nine-piece nigiri platter, which used to hover around $30, is now $48. With soup and dessert included, it’s still a non-outrageous deal, relatively speaking, but it also means this place isn’t really the “cheaper” option it once was. The good news is, even if Ushiwakamaru has lost its price conscious and hole-in-the-wall defining characteristics, the sushi is still excellent.
Ushiwakamaru isn’t going to be everyone’s go-to. But if you hang around 9th Avenue and don’t mind paying up a bit, it could certainly be yours."

",3.0,American,The NoMad,7.8,"Not long ago, The Nomad was a big deal. When Daniel Humm left Eleven Madison Park to open a restaurant in a hotel, the word ""blockbuster"" got thrown around more than it had since the days when Adam Sandler still had a movie career.
We here at The Infatuation have always liked The Nomad, but we've never been all in on it. In our initial 2012 review, we expressed respect for the quality of the food and the attention to detail on display, but couldn't get past the constant foot traffic around the tables, or the luck of the draw nature of the seating. You either end up with the best table in the house or one of the worst. There is no in between.
After a few years of various return visits, we're happy to say that we like it here more. But we're still not ready to go all in. We've just figured out how to do it right.
The first thing you need to know is that, despite the connections to Eleven Madison Park, The Nomad is not the special occasion restaurant that you might expect it to be. It's a hotel restaurant with a very busy bar and a nighttime scene, which is perfect if you're looking to have a really good meal with a lot to look at in terms of the crowd, but it is not the place to bring your dad for his quiet birthday dinner. This is a place where you're probably going to see a guy who owns an art gallery and looks like Genghis Kahn in Yeezy Boosts sitting next to a group of dudes who are definitely on a business trip. All of that can be a very good thing for a fun Thursday night, but maybe not so much for a big ticket, once a year meal.
The other thing you should know is that The Nomad is at its best during the daytime hours. It's one of our favorite fancy lunch moves, especially if we're looking to impress someone with our restaurant selecting prowess. Things are also a bit more sedate during those times, which means that you're more likely to end up at a table that won't be right in path of a bunch of people heading for the bar.
However you approach it, know that the food here is very good. Their famous chicken for two is famous for a reason, and that reason is foie gras and truffles. Both are ground up and stuffed under the crispy skin, making for an absurdly rich and absurdly good piece of bird. The rest of the menu is consistently solid, from starters to dessert, and the wine list and cocktails will get the job done too.
Is that enough to still consider The Nomad a big deal? That probably depends a little bit on who you ask. And a lot on where you sit."

",3.0,French,Mountain Bird,8.3,"New York is full of unusual restaurants. But none of them are quite like Mountain Bird.When you hear the facts, they sound like something out of a weird 21st century children's book: The restaurant is run by a Japanese couple, and they serve almost exclusively poultry. The husband cooks up all the parts of all the birds, right down to the gizzards, mostly using traditional French styles, while his wife runs the front of house in a clumsily endearing way. The whole thing goes down in a quaint little room complete with monogrammed plates that feels like a countryside bed and breakfast, but is actually in Harlem. It's as if you're eating in the couple’s living room (which you kind of are). To top it all off, the server is wearing fashionable gray sweatpants. Also - the restaurant keeps changing locations.Mountain Bird flies all over, refusing to stay perched in one place. We first experienced the restaurant in its short lived location on West 145th Street, and promptly hung an 8.6 rating, calling Mountain Bird ""one of the most unique and delicious meals that we can remember.""Now it's moved to a new location in East Harlem, in the small dining room of a catering company called Tastings. It may or may not be permanent - we couldn't get a straight answer. The new spot isn't quite as cozy as the original, as it lacks the quirky homeyness of their first location, and is the main reason for the rating reduction. The food and overall experience, however, are still great and we’re psyched we got another chance to try New York's best cassoulet again. Haven’t had a cassoulet since Grandma made one when you were 7? Theirs is a glorious winter stew featuring cockscomb and duck leg, and it’s incredible.There’s something a little off about Mountain Bird, which is the exact reason why we love it so much. It’s not like the service is great, or the dining “experience” part of it is impressive. It’s not. But the people are just so damn nice, and so earnest - the wife actually remembered us from eating in her restaurant a year and a half ago. Most importantly, the food is awesome and it’s different from what you see on every other menu. They make unfamiliar parts of a chicken seem approachable, if not totally desirable. We tried to enjoy the gizzard salad, but just couldn’t do it.Ultimately, we love Mountain Bird for being different, for being creative, and for serving cockscomb. If you live on the Upper East Side and are desperate for a great new restaurant to go to, you’re in luck. Turns out this place is totally for real."

",3.0,Korean,Her Name is Han,8.8,"Sometimes, when we discover a great new restaurant, we like to imagine ourselves as old Hollywood agents who’ve just discovered new talent.
“Barry!” we’d say in that old very pronounced way they talk in old movies, probably while smoking a cigar. “I found a star.”
Today, that star is Her Name Is Han. And for right now, you’re going to be Barry. (Sorry about that.)
Her Name Is Han has a lot of star potential. First, a great name – the perfect trifecta of memorable, unusual, and fun to say. Second, a great look – the place looks like something between a library, an East Village apartment, and a movie studio. It totally works. Third, and most important, both the food and the overall vibe are excellent, and unlike that of any others we’ve found in New York.
Han specializes in homestyle Korean food – which means everything from seafood stews, to plates of spicy pork, to noodle soups, to pan-fried dried fish that tastes like candy. All of it feels incredibly fresh and even light, an unusual combination when you’re eating food that’s spicy and fermented. No matter what we order here, it tends to be great.
Located a block away from the heart of the bright neon lights of Koreatown, Han is relatively laid back, but everyone here always seems to be having fun. Maybe it’s the $27 bottles of grapefruit and blueberry-infused, house-brewed soju, or the $6 soju cocktails. Maybe it’s the improbably great soul/jazz soundtrack that we Shazam-ed numerous times. Either way, it’s the kind of restaurant you walk out of happy, wanting to tell all your friends about it. So Barry, when are we taking you to Han?"

",2.0,BBQ,Hometown Bar-B-Que,8.9,"Good BBQ is often something you have to travel for. Even in Texas, all the best ’cue is generally a car ride away. But the way we see it, the anticipation built from a little bit of travel is a good thing. The drive, the sweet smoky aroma upon entry, the line, and then finally confronting the beautiful, massive tray of BBQ before your face is all part of the experience. Well, New Yorkers, it’s time to put that friend with a car to good use. You need a ride to Red Hook. That’s where the best BBQ in NYC is.
Not so long ago, Texas-style BBQ was impossible to find in NYC. Now, we’ve got an embarrassment of riches. Mighty Quinn’s, Morgan’s, Fette Sau, and BrisketTown are all great, but the undisputed king of NYC ’cue is Hometown Bar-B-Que. This sh*t would be hyped even if it was located in Texas.Hometown Bar-B-Que’s New York-bred pitmaster Bill Durney may not come from Texas, but he’s a student of its barbecue culture. Durney is serious about his craft. He has dedicated his life to soaking in as much BBQ knowledge as humanly possible and learned to smoke meats from some of the greats. And he’s now ushered in the first New York BBQ operation that truly nails the essence of Texas ’cue.
First off, this is a Texas-sized restaurant. You could literally fit every other NYC BBQ restaurant inside of Hometown. The huge two-barn dust hall is filled with big bars, televisions, American flags, and even a stage for live music. Quite a bit of a departure from the BBQ joints we’ve been trying to fit into studio apartments in this city. As for the food, there are three absolute must orders at Hometown. 1) The gargantuan beef rib, which would give you a black eye if it hit you in the face. 2) The moist brisket, which has some of the most incredible crusty bark we’ve ever tasted. And 3) The pork ribs, which are the best we’ve had in this city.
If you love BBQ, make a trip to Red Hook immediately. Hometown is the current king of NYC ’cue."

",2.0,BBQ,Fletcher's Brooklyn BBQ,6.8,"A couple years ago Brooklyn BBQ blew up. Suddenly everyone was driving smokers up from Texas and throwing brisket over coals from Red Hook to Williamsburg to Gowanus and everywhere else they could find enough space. Restaurants like Hometown and Morgan’s were the talk of BBQ fans all over town, and deservedly so. They were f*cking revelations. Fletcher’s Brooklyn BBQ opened around that same time, but the buzz seemed to fall off quickly.
Fletcher’s is a traditional American cue with influences from all over the map. We got some hints of Texas, Carolina, and the Midwest. The people behind it care about their meats, and only source it from farms that take good care of their animals. Like most BBQ joints, it’s counter service, and has great craft beers on tap and a small but well-curated selection of whiskeys. In 2006, Fletcher’s would have been one of the best BBQ options in town. But unfortunately, Fletcher’s meats just aren’t as memorable as some of the others. That being said, we’d happily eat it anytime. The standard is set pretty high nowadays, but this is still some solid ‘cue.
Pulled pork, either on its own or in a sandwich, is the best thing on the menu, followed by the hot links. We’re all for a fatty piece of brisket, but not one where you have to cut half the piece off because it’s blubbery jello. Also, most of the ‘cue needs BBQ sauce. Bad. The pork ribs are a bit too dry, and while the rub flavors are excellent, it’s not until they’re smothered with sauce that really good things start to happen. Not a tragedy by any means, and their sauce is sweet and smoky heaven, but the mark of great BBQ is that it shouldn’t need to be sauced to be awesome.
The bottom line is that Fletcher’s is an excellent local option for anyone who lives in or around the Gowanus hood, but it’s not worth going out of your way for, unless you’re BBQ crawling BK like it’s the outskirts of Austin. In that case, the Fletcher’s pulled pork needs to be on your trail map."

",2.0,Italian,Al Di La,9.0,"“Pay attention to the specials.”
I can’t imagine how many times I have written that sentence, but I do know that it’s a lot. The Infatuation: helping restaurants sell day-old food since 2009.
But here the sentence has a different meaning.
Lately, we’ve become more judicious about what restaurants actually warrant an Infatuation review. In the beginning, our main goal was coverage – making sure that when you opened up the app or searched the site, you got a full and effective set of results. Looking for day drinking in Williamsburg on a Tuesday? No judgment here, only answers... you drunk.
But as time has passed and the reviews have rolled in, we now find ourselves in a different situation. One in which we need to limit the number of places that we write up such that you are only getting the stuff that matters or fits a need. Do we really have to weigh in on that farm to table Thai restaurant that will likely close before you get a chance to eat there? Probably not. A 7.2 isn’t gonna do much for you.
It then becomes more important than ever that we add extra emphasis to the establishments in this city that are truly special. Restaurants that are worth going out of your way for. Al Di La is one of them.It should probably go without saying that a restaurant that’s been open since 1998 is still good. Consistency is the only way to keep people coming back year after year, let alone decade after decade. But Al Di La is more than just that. In a city with so many Italian restaurants that even the American ones serve pasta, few are actually memorable enough that you make a mental note to bring your mom there next time she’s in town. Even fewer have a menu that is perfect from top to bottom. Fewer still know how to serve a bottle of wine at the right temperature. (Why do so many Italian restaurants store their wine above the oven?) But the best part about Al Di La is that it’s simple. No gimmicks, no scene, just rustic Italian food that will never fail you.
So, while we remind ourselves to pay attention to the specials, let this serve as a reminder that you should, too. Some are restaurants in a class of their own. And some are just day old food."

",3.0,Pasta,La Pecora Bianca,6.9,"The easiest reviews to write are for the extremes: the “Wow, I would bathe in this steak sauce every day forever,” kind of restaurants and the “I think I just paid $30 for something a baby would eat from a can” ones. Then there are the ones that sit right in the middle, places that we would send you to, but with an asterisk or two. Welcome to La Pecora Bianca*.
One thing to be sure about La Pecora Bianca – this is one of those “cute” restaurants. The space is bright, the vibe is lively, and there’s a big bar area that’s perfect for after work drink meetups. It’s also located in a part of town that simply needs more restaurants, right on the corner of 26th and Broadway. 
But those are where the strictly positive traits at La Pecora Bianca end. The menu here is something of a “concept” – the pastas are all made in house, mostly out of whole grain wheat flour. Gluten free pasta is also available as a substitution in every case. And while that’s a nice idea for the Celiac sufferers and sympathizers of the world, it makes for a strange experience for those of us who don’t see a plain old plate of pasta as a plate of poison. Yes, the “Einkorn Gramigna” here is good, but the spaghetti with whole wheat pasta is not. Please just give us the poison.So there lies the rub. Do we tell you to avoid this restaurant, knowing that there are better Italian restaurants (that won’t force you to eat ancient grains) where we could send you instead? Or do we embrace the situational utility of La Pecora Bianca, and promise you not a mind-blowing experience, but instead a good enough one that’s useful for a casual, potentially gluten-free hang with a group of friends?
Ultimately, we’ll lean slightly towards the latter. At one point or another, everyone needs an easy place for dinner in this part of town, and at the very least, La Pecora Bianca is that. It’s a good move if you’re looking to grab a drink and maybe feed one of your picky friends who just came off a juice cleanse, but it is not a place you probably want to take your buddies from the office before a Knicks game.
Now you know the asterisks."

",4.0,French,Vaucluse,7.8,"A few decades back, if you wanted to have a serious dining experience in New York, you went to a French restaurant. Anniversary? Closed a deal? That's going to mean a table at Lutece or Le Cirque, with a chocolate soufflé for dessert. For lunch.
We don't say this to just to show you that we looked up a ""Restaurants Featured On Mad Men"" article, but rather to say that, obviously, things have changed. Restaurants are now considered exciting if they play hip hop, have mini farms in their back alleys, and have 12 chefs who ""collaborate"" nightly on a single gourmet burger.
This brings us to Vaucluse, the Upper East Side French restaurant from Michael White, the pasta prophet you know from other #fancy restaurants like Marea and Ai Fiori.On the surface, Vaucluse has many of the elements of one of those classic French restaurants: there are white tablecloths, you can order a duck à l’orange for two, it’s literally on Park Avenue, and you probably wouldn’t want to show up wearing sneakers. The crowd predictably involves both suits and botox. But there’s also a burger on the menu, and a bar where you can post up and drink cocktails, and the service isn’t fussy at all. The place is fancy, to a degree, but it also feels modern. Think of it more as an update than a throwback.
Fortunately, the food we’ve eaten here has been delicious. The pastas are very tasty, as expected, but dishes like beef tartare and a deconstructed tuna tartare slash niçoise salad actually steal the show. And the bread is so good that nearly everyone in the restaurant seems to actually be eating it. If you build it, they will come, and if you hand-make the butter, they will consume it.
For us, Vaucluse is ultimately a bit formal for anything that’s not a Special Occasion, without quite being at the level of a true Very Special Occasion destination like Daniel. So we’re not sure how often or in what situations we’ll be back. But should our lives involve some kind of turn that involves everyday upscale French dining on the Upper East Side, we’ll take it, because the food here is really good."

I mean saw the name of a place, said to yourself, ""what is this cool looking thing?"" only to find out that nobody you know had heard of it either?That's the way we felt when we first heard about Le Fanfare, and let me tell you - that's an unfamiliar feeling for a bunch of people who spend all of their time eating in and writing about restaurants. Much like we imagine Chris Christie would feel if he suddenly discovered a new place to do all his yelling.  It all went down like this because of Text Rex, our real time resatauarnt recommendation platform. Some dude in there was asking for a restaurant ""like Le Fanfare, but different"" and before we wrote him off as a confused tourist, we did some searching. Turns out Le Fanfare is not a basement burlesque show in Paris, but an Italian restaurant in Greenpoint. One that looked really f*cking cool."

",2.0,Vegetarian,Avant Garden,8.4,"Vegetarian and vegan restaurants tend to be a lot like cover bands. The majority are awful, and some are actually shockingly good. Either way, they’re performing imitations of the real thing.
That’s the case, for example, at Superiority Burger, a vegetarian takeout spot two few blocks up from the restaurant in question (which has received an inexplicably large amount of press). The veggie burger is tasty, sure, and probably the best of its kind, but it’s ultimately a cover band – a veggie version of Shake Shack or Corner Bistro or whatever other burgers people like. And look: that’s fine. It’s not like the guy in the KISS tribute band really wants people to think he’s Gene Simmons. (Well, he probably does, but you know he’s not).
This brings us to Avant Garden, a tiny vegan East Village restaurant operated by the owner of several bars in the neighborhood. Here’s the thing: Avant Garden is not a cover band.Rather than serve vegetables that taste like meat, Avant Garden serves vegetables that taste like vegetables. They also serve bread, and pasta. Chewy, crusty bread topped with tomato jam and pickled peaches? Turns out that’s totally vegan. We’ve never eaten anything exactly like it in a restaurant, meat-serving or not. And that’s the case with the dishes throughout the menu here: they’re legitimately original. They’re also legitimately extremely tasty.
Like most good artists, Avant Garden is definitely inspired and informed by other food. The beets dish definitely shares some qualities with a tuna tartare, and one of the mushrooms we ate tasted a lot like a scallop. But we felt smart when we realized that, not like we’d been asked to suspend our disbelief and pretend that beet was actually raw fish.
Avant Garden may not be the kind of music you usually listen to, and eating there isn’t necessarily going to convert you into a diehard of the vegan genre. The experience also comes with some quirks, as opening yourself to new things often does. In this case, the tiny, unventilated space and open kitchen mean the room can get very smoky. Service can also be a little funky, probably due in part to the fact that there’s barely anywhere for the servers to stand.
But you’ll get over it – trying new things is good, and you’ll definitely get to do that at Avant Garden."

The Feel Good Factor™ seeped into our veins. Sign me up, pour me a drink, and feed me guacamole and chips all night long, bartender. We found La Contenta the way we always find the best restaurants no one else is talking about – through one of you loyal Infatuation readers. This Lower East Side spot is small in stature – they have 14 seats – but huge on personality. La Contenta is an authentic Mexican restaurant owned and operated by Mexicans, with excellent cocktails and a chef with serious skills. This restaurant may not be winning awards anytime soon, but it’s one you need to know about.The menu at La Contenta is made up of modern takes on traditional Mexican, and the dishes are very good – better than they need to be. You’ll find excellent guacamole and nachos, an awesome pork belly tostada, and some of the better fish tacos around. But our real enthusiasm for La Contenta springs from the fact that it is the ultimate neighborhood hang. It’s the kind of place you’re psyched to return to, so it makes sense that pretty much everyone at La Contenta on any night of the week is a regular. They know the bartender with the sweet hat by name (It’s Alex, by the way), and treat him like family.Need a good low commitment idea for a first date? La Contenta is your move. (And nab the bar booth seat situation in the corner.) How about a reasonably priced place to catch up with your friends over drinks and maybe a little dinner? Yup, La Contenta is good for that, too. Out late on the Lower East Side and need a nightcap and some fish tacos? They serve a bar menu till 1:30am Thursday through Saturday. We’ll be sending people here on Text Rex constantly from now on.
La Contenta is the Mexican version of Upstate Craft Beer & Oyster Bar. It’s a restaurant run by a small team of super dedicated people who truly care about their craft and their customers. It’s under-the-radar, and yet the people who know, know. That’s how it is. Well, now you know."

",3.0,American,The Dutch,7.8,"When we first reviewed The Dutch back in 2011, it was the hottest restaurant in town. Chef Andrew Carmellini’s post-Locanda Verde coming out party was a full-blown rager, and The Dutch was awarded best new restaurant of the year by
every food publication without a turkey leg as their logo. While we thought it was totally fine, we weren’t getting on our hands and knees like everyone else. Our initial opinion was that while The Dutch was a good restaurant, it was a little overrated.
Cut to a few years later, and The Dutch has evolved. It’s no longer a restaurant cooking with the goal of getting a certain number of stars in a
newspaper, and it’s finally settled into being what it always should have been: a restaurant cooking for the people. The menu is full of all-American greatest hits, from a very good burger to an even better fried chicken, and some raw bar in between. Everything is well-executed and satisfying, clearly cooked by people who know what they’re doing the kitchen.
The Dutch is not the hottest spot on the block anymore, but it’s still slammed all day every day, and it comes in handy for pretty much everything. From weekday lunch to weekend brunch, dinner with the girls, or 11pm eats any day of the week, The Dutch is never a bad move. These days, it might actually be underrated."

",4.0,American,The Clocktower,8.2,"If you’ve spent any time in London lately, you’ve probably noticed that there’s something happening with the restaurant scene over there. Call it a rebirth, call it gentrification, or call it Brooklynization (actually, don’t call it that), but there is definitely a new crop of interesting, youthful, excellent restaurants popping up around that city. A city, mind you, whose most significant recent contributions to the U.S. food scene have been Gordon Ramsay and allowing Kate Middleton to be seen at a McDonald's once. Thanks, England.
Let it be known that The Clocktower is the sign of times changing. This restaurant on the second floor of the Edition Hotel on Madison Square Park is a near exact facsimile of Berners Tavern, an excellent and very popular establishment inside the London Edition. It’s not a true import - both The Clocktower and Berners are run by the same chef, but our American version is backed by Stephen Starr to make sure it translates from British to American. Like Steve Carell.
And translate it does. The menu at The Clocktower can best be described as “vaguely” English, in that you’ll find things like Dover sole and pigeon pie intermingled with skirt steak and halibut and mac 'n cheese, which in reality is probably the truest expression of American dining that you can find. What’s more American than a little bit of everything? A lot of everything. And there’s a lot of incredibly good food here.
Beyond what there is to eat, there is also a lot to see in this restaurant. The space takes up the entire second floor of the building, and is comprised of several rooms decorated wall-to-wall with classic photographs of musicians, actors, and artists. There’s even a purple pool table, just to make sure you know the place is pretttty chill. Ultimately though, the good vibes in the room come less from the props and more from the excellent and professional service. This is not just another hotel restaurant. This is a restaurant on par with some of the best in this town.
So now that it’s been proven that a London restaurant can work in New York, what do we gotta do to get some real Cadbury Crunchie bars up in here? We’ll give you all of Gordon Ramsay’s remaining restaurants back in return."

",4.0,American,Blue Ribbon Brasserie,9.0,"Blue Ribbon Brasserie was the first restaurant that ever received a 9.0 rating on The Infatuation. We published that initial review in August of 2009, not long after we birthed this fussy child of a website. Now that this thing has grown into a spoiled teenager, we figured it was time to circle back around on one of our most highly-held establishments.
Not that we really needed to. I’ve been to this, the original restaurant in the Blue Ribbon empire, so many times in the last six years that I could probably throw on a crisp white shirt and stand in as a server in the event of an emergency, except for the fact that I tend to sweat and yell at people when I get nervous. I can tell you with confidence that this place is exactly as good today as it was when it opened in 1992.
The thing you need to understand about Blue Ribbon and its 9.0 rating is that it did not earn that high number for being the greatest meal you can have in New York City. But Blue Ribbon is the greatest meal you can have at 3am in the
world. And that’s part of why you live here, isn’t it? Aren’t you the person who visits other major cities and complains about how everyone goes to bed too early? Or how you can’t get a slice of pizza at midnight? Or how grass and fresh air makes your skin itch? Well, Blue Ribbon Brasserie is the thing you have that nobody else does. While everyone else in lesser cities sleeps
soundly in their “houses,” you get to eat bone marrow and fried chicken from a white table cloth-covered table, in a room full (and it will be full) of other like-minded individuals at some unholy hour of the early morning. On a Tuesday.
What has always surprised me is how few people even know that. Most of the time when I tell people that Blue Ribbon is my favorite restaurant, they reply, “Oh, the sushi place!” or “You mean that chicken spot in the bowling alley?” This brand now has about 15 other establishments under its banner, and while we’re glad it has seen that level of success, most people these days don’t even know what the Brasserie is.
So with this updated review, let’s just say that if you find yourself in that group, you should fix it. Blue Ribbon is open until 4am every night, waiting to show you the way. Just pray you don’t see me stroll up to take your order. For both of our sakes."

",3.0,Diner,Sadelle’s,8.5,"For whatever reason, the idea of Jewish appetizing hasn’t evolved much over time. With the exception of Russ & Daughters finally opening a dining room, bagels, lox, eggs, and babka are generally still eaten at places that have been around for generations. And a lot of the time that place is grandma’s living room. Not anymore. Now we have Sadelle’s, and holy sh*t is it incredible.
Welcome to West Broadway Reform, Temple Of Hot Bagels. Sadelle’s is a modern day synagogue you don’t need to be Jewish to belong to, as long as you’re down to pray to the God of Smoked Salmon.
The restaurant comes from Major Food Group (the team behind Carbone, Dirty French, and Santina), and as we’ve grown accustomed to seeing, when they open a new place, they go big. It’s a production. And that’s very much the case at Sadelle’s: bagels and smoked fish are served on grand towers usually reserved for lobster and caviar. The staff wears throwback baking outfits and chant “hot bagels” in unison every time a new batch hits the pegs. The tables are set with the Laguiole cutlery and Le Creuset plates you’ve probably seen on someone’s wedding registry. And in the middle of it all is the bagel-making facility, enclosed in glass as if it were the fish tank housing the biggest, most impressive sharks at the aquarium.
Jewish appetizing in this city has certainly never been this flashy, but it’s also never been this good.
The space is huge, and split up into a sit down restaurant and a take-out bakery where you can get bagels and babka to go. Yes, the lines at the take-out area during prime time are long, but good luck finding an excellent bagel joint in NYC where you won’t have to wait 20 minutes at noon on Saturday. It comes with the territory, and it’s one of the few things New Yorkers seem totally fine with lining up for. If you’re eating in the restaurant, make a reservation, or come on a weekday.
The restaurant section offers a bigger menu, which includes everything from eggs to blintzes to turkey sandwiches to what may be the best french toast in New York City. The dishes are expensive - $17 for an egg sandwich is particularly crazy - but most of them are so good that we’re willing to deal with the inflated prices.

",3.0,Mexican,Rosie's,6.9,"Ever watch a random movie on a plane? Usually it's something harmless, a romantic comedy with bright colors and attractive people. Maybe you laughed a few times. Afterwards, you thought, ""Well, that was 'cute' enough."" It wasn't anything particularly memorable, and somewhere deep down you held on to the sense you could probably have made better use of you time. But with a glass of alcohol in your hand and nowhere else to be, you felt fine about things.
This has been our experience at Rosie's, a big Mexican restaurant in the East Village: it's a perfectly OK place to have a good time, but relatively unmemorable overall. On multiple visits, we didn't walk away feeling like we needed to order anything we'd eaten again. Most of it wasn't bad, it was just not all that exciting.
The restaurant is the newest project from the chefs behind Cookshop and Vic's, but it has more in common with the nearby ""well, that was definitely fine"" Vic's than it does with the original ""that place was actually great"" Cookshop. The space is big and open, decorated with what are essentially glorified string lights, giving the whole place kind of backyard party on Pinterest vibe. If it's warm out, the doors are all open to the street, and there's an outdoor seating area that makes 2nd Avenue actually feel pretty nice. It's a good space in which to drink tequila and eat some guacamole, just don't expect to be wowed by the majority of the food.
Put it this way: is this a restaurant you should go out of your way to make a reservation at? No. But if you end up here because your friend booked it for their birthday party? (And someone is inevitably going to book it for their birthday party). You'll be fine."

school thing our parents still do called ""email"" - we listen. And when we hear
it from every direction, we act. The burger at Rose's has been pushed on us
constantly, so we knew this was going to be good. The people are rarely wrong.
Rose's is an upscale dive serving elevated bar food in the space that once
housed the original Franny's. It's a locals hang, and an excellent option for
low key meals, laid back Sports On TV or a pre/post Barclays
Center
EEEEEATS mission. They have a great Outdoor/Patio Situation out back too,
which is key for the warmer months.
The burger is the star of the show, and the reason you're coming here. Rose's
burger is the anthesis to all these crazy custom burger blends every
restaurant brags about on their menu these days. There's no LaFrieda beef
concoction, no crazy special sauce, no pretzel bun, no lobster tail served
atop Rose's burger. It's a classic burger on a soft sesame bun with nothing
except griddle grease, American cheese, and good feelings. Your grandfather
would approve.
The rest of the small menu at Rose's is solid too, and from what we hear,
they'll be expanding upon it a lot. The spit pork is one of the better pork
chops we've had in recent memory, and if that's any indication of where things
are going, the future is bright and meaty.

",3.0,American,Faro,7.2,"There's a certain kind of restaurant that serves all of its food on artisan
ceramic plates - you know, the kind that look like they came from a craft fair
and not off an assembly line. It's a way of saying: we're not a factory, and
you're not about to eat this bowl of grains out of an Ikea bowl. There are a
lot of restaurants like this in places like San Francisco and Portland and
Seattle (I've never been but I just KNOW), and yes, in Brooklyn.
Faro, which is a block from the Jefferson L stop in Bushwick, serves all of
its food on those perfectly imperfect plates - and they're just the right
vessel for the slightly quirky pastas that make up the majority of the menu.
What's that, chicken confit and some broth with your bucatini? Shishito
peppers and mint with your gnudi? Do these things taste better when they're
served in a dish that was hand-glazed and manually placed into a kiln?
Probably. Take that, Crate and Barrel.
The rest of the place is filled out with all the requisite touches - hard
chairs no doubt made from salvaged wood, big ceilings, and huge racks of
firewood of questionable purpose near the entrance.
All of this could lead to a restaurant that feels like the setting for a
Portlandia sketch, but in reality it's a pretty relaxed place and a nice
addition to the neighborhood. The service is friendly, the prices are
reasonable, and it's generally a nice spot to hang out. Some of the food looks
or sounds a little more satisfying than it is, but there are plenty of things
we like.
If you spend a lot of time in Bushwick, you'll want Faro on your hit list.
It's a good place for a date, and probably the best place around here to take
parents or a group of out of towners, largely owing to the fact that they
actually take reservations. It's not the destination that Roberta's is, but
Faro serves a different purpose: it feels like a restaurant for grown ups.

Unless you've seen it with your own eyes, you'd have no clue El Luchador exists, since it's posted up on the westernmost tip of South Street, steps from the water. We didn't know about it till a friend who worked in the area tipped us off, and now it's our number one suggestion in Text Rex whenever anyone asks where they should eat at by the Seaport.
The fish tacos are excellent, and the full roster of tacos will do more than get the job done. This place reminds us of a simpler version of Tacombi at Fonda Nolita, complete with a retro Airstream on the property that has a couple tables to sit at. There's also a sweet little outdoor courtyard area decorated with string lights.

We're intrigued, yet skeptical.
At Bruno, a lot of the pizzas are interesting, but we're just not all in on their thick, dry, whole wheat pizza dough. The funky pizzas are worthy of a taste test if pizza is a hobby of yours - and a lot of people in the restaurant appear to be enjoying it, but with so many A-rate pizzas in close proximity, we can't see ourselves coming back for Bruno too often.
That's not to say we aren't impressed by the effort. The ingredients and creativity that go into the pies are appreciated, and we've never been to a pizza joint that also offers crudo and crudite as well. From a culinary
perspective, Bruno is probably the most ""advanced"" pizza restaurant in NYC. Clearly, the chefs, and there are many of them (over 10 listed on the menu), have talent and are passionate about what they're cooking. But at times it
feels like they're combining ingredients that don't taste all that great together, and ultimately cooking a little bit too much for themselves, and not necessarily for the diners.
That said, everyone who works here is super friendly and engaging, which is good, because Bruno automatically adds a 20% service charge to every order, rather than a tip. The bright space is also nice room to hang out in, so it's a good time overall.
As much as we like it for its ambition and its good vibes, we left on multiple visits feeling like if there's one cuisine that doesn't really need to be played with in the lab, it's pizza."

",3.0,Seafood,Seamore’s,8.1,"We’ll admit that when it was announced that Michael Chernow, owner of The Meatball Shop, was opening a new seafood concept restaurant in Nolita, we were skeptical. Not because we don’t love The Meatball Shop or seafood, but because a trendy, casual place near Chinatown where people come to eat fresh-caught fish every day sounds on paper more like a business idea that Adam Levine or Blake Lively or their newly formed venture fund would come up with rather than one launched by a successful restaurateur.
But if one thing is consistently true when it comes to making money on food in New York City, it’s that doing one thing and doing it right is the quickest way to success. And after several visits to Seamore’s we can tell you that this is a restaurant done right.
Once you’ve spent some time here, you’ll quickly come to the realization, as we have, that Seamore’s is actually genius. What Chernow and whoever backed this idea clearly realized is something that most restaurants don’t right now:
this is how young people in New York City want to be eating. Seamore’s is a place where you can come with a group of friends, spend a somewhat reasonable amount of money, have a nice night out, and (most importantly) eat something healthy. The menu is entirely focused on serving whatever kind of sustainable, fresh fish is available, in many different forms. You can have it in a taco, you can have it on a sandwich, or you can have it in a bowl, and everyone knows that healthy things come in bowls. That’s how you keep all the nutrients inside.
The environment is cool and casual, the drinks range from craft beer to cold-pressed juice with vodka in it, and the only dessert is one rotating flavor of Odd Fellows soft serve. On one of our visits, the flavor was actually some kind of vegan dark chocolate, and we’re pretty sure we saw three girls fighting to take hits of it directly from the machine.
If that’s not proof of concept, we don’t know what is."

No matter what time of day it is, there will be a huge line to place an order at this counter-style vegan restaurant that people lose their gluten over. There will also be a Hunger Games-esque competition for a seat, except in this game of survival, there are no weapons, only bitchy glares, and everyone survives because it’s actually going to be FINE.
After those emotions pass, the next thing you’ll feel is a state of wonder as to why more people aren’t opening restaurants like this. In many ways, it seems so obvious to simply set up shop in a small space, buy some shit from Anthropologie, and start selling vaguely healthy food to a city of people who clearly want it. Why isn’t there one of these on every corner? Maybe because making a meatless meatball that doesn’t taste like wet newspaper and throw up isn’t as easy as it might sound. Serving a vegan ice cream that’s actually worth eating is grounds for a peace prize.And such is the genius of by CHLOE. Opened by (you guessed it) Chloe Coscarelli, a studied vegan chef and cookbook author who until now was best known for winning an episode of Cupcake Wars, this is most certainly the best vegan restaurant in town/maybe the world. For all of the other “healthy” hot spots out there, by CHLOE is the one that actually makes this food seem the most like something you actually want to consume several times a week, rather than just that one time your most annoying vegetarian friend asked you to out to dinner.
What you’ll find at by CHLOE is casual setup serving excellent salads, very good veggie burgers that look like they could easily have come from Shake Shack, and fries that could not have because they’re actually good. And yes, we just said fries. Turns out those are vegan, too.

What they’ve managed to create is downright astonishing. It’s now an internationally renowned brand that’s spawned copycats and imitators all across the globe.
Roberta’s put Bushwick on the map, literally. Before Roberta’s moved in, no one was hanging out in the warehouses surrounding the Boar’s Head bologna factory, let alone considering calling this place home. Without trying to, Roberta’s changed everything. They started a movement. They made Bushwick cool and put in on the national radar. Admit it, your first trip to Bushwick was for a Bee Sting or Axl Rosenberg pizza. Ours was, too, and we remember it fondly.
Since our first trip to this pizza metropolis, much has changed, and yet everything is exactly the same. The food continues to be outstanding. Not only are the imaginative pizzas that perfect balance of puffy, chewy, and charred, but the pastas, the vegetables, the meats, the beer selection, it all just seems to get better and better. Roberta’s is a restaurant for serious food people who don’t take their food so seriously.
What started as a reasonably sized warehouse with a little outdoor area has now turned into a compound that occupies an entire city block. Roberta’s now has a garden, an event space, a radio station (that was always there, actually), a tasting menu-only restaurant with two Michelin stars (Blanca), a bakery that serves as their hub for all things takeout and delivery, and there are wild rumors of an arcade that serves disco fries, a bowling alley, and an archery range with an alpaca petting zoo coming soon. It’ll be like Blue Hill Stone Barns for kids in cutoff jean shorts and dirty Vans. Editor’s note: don’t believe any of the rumors we just made up.
Part of the reason Roberta’s is such a special place is because they haven’t done anything else yet. Instead of opening up new restaurants, they just keep expanding upon the original. Roberta’s is that indie rock band that makes an insane debut album, blows up, and instead of releasing new records, keeps putting out bonus tracks and remixes of the original album. Why? Either because the band is in a perpetual state of turmoil (fact), or they are content with what they have. Regardless, we’re cool with it.
Soon enough, Roberta’s may tastefully Papa John’s this thing, and when they do, the world will be waiting with open arms. Until then, you should make the trip to Bushwick."

This Italian restaurant makes excellent fresh pasta in a ""let's pretend we're in a market in Rome"" kind of setting, and while the pizzas look good and are probably the best available in a ten block radius, they're not the reason for a visit. Tavola does the classics best, including a straightforward lasagna that we'll be coming back for.

1. The top of the top, the kind of places that people make documentaries and write novels on Yelp about - the Sushi Nakazawas of the world. The space will be beautiful, and the courses will be plenty. The food may blow your mind, and so will the bill. Probably an anniversary/birthday/just IPO-ed kind of affair, reserved for maybe once a year, maybe once a lifetime visits.
2. Places that are still serving some pretty fancy/serious sushi, but cost a little less, and probably at least give you the option of ordering a la carte. Sushi Of Gari is a good example.
3. The quality neighborhood spots we can actually patronize regularly - bless you Takahachi.
4. Finally, places solely reserved for Seamless orders. Try not to look too closely when you pass them in real life.
Here's the thing about Domodomo, which took the place of beloved Tier 2 standby Ushiwakamaru on Houston Street: we're not sure which group it fits into. Why is this sushi place different from all other sushi places? First of all, Domodomo is a ""handroll bar,"" which means instead of rolls or pieces of sushi, you're ordering handrolls. They're all freshly made, with crisp seaweed, quality rice, and good fish, even if we don't know how many of them to order.
Aesthetically, the place looks like it could be in Tier #1. It's probably the light wood, and the whole quiet, zen vibe of the place. They also serve you a tiny little tablet that expands into a towel when you drop it in some water that's enclosed in a polished rock. Don't worry about the details - point is, it feels fancy.
Pricewise, you can end up at either a Tier 2 or a 3. There's a $68 omakase option, and other $45 or $30 handroll sets. We've ordered a la carte, and still can't figure out how much to order. Four handrolls and some other dishes to share? We also probably could have eaten twelve, but you'd start getting close to Tier #1 prices pretty quickly.
We like Domodomo, but we're not quite sure when to use it. It's a little intense to be a neighborhood spot (though the food is more than good enough, and if you order smartly, the prices OK), but not quite special enough to be a special occasion destination. Maybe on a date where you don't want to eat too much? Not sure we're ready to add a fifth tier just yet."

",3.0,Mediterranean,Taboon,7.7,"We've got a handful of spots that we like in Hell's Kitchen, and Taboon is one
of our absolute favorites. That says a lot for the food, considering the
restaurant itself lacks most qualities of a typical Infatuation Approved
establishment. It's pricey and a little stuffy, and the music they play is an
unlistenable combination of Greek lounge music and Yanni remixes. Oh yeah, and
it's on 10th Avenue. But what Taboon lacks in cool, it more than makes up for
with top quality Mediterranean eats and good service.
A taboon is an Arabic word for a wood-burning oven, and the one in the front
of this restaurant turns out some damn tasty food. Things that swim seem to
benefit the most from the taboon treatment - all of the fish entrees here are
excellent, and the octopus and lamb kebab pot pie should not be missed. They
also bake an amazing fresh focaccia and serve it on a paddle, which I then use
to jam the entire loaf down my throat at once. More please.
Prices are a little steep, so Taboon probably shouldn't be in your heavy
rotation, but we recommend spending the extra bucks if you're in the area
looking for a solid meal."

",1.0,Mediterranean,Jack's Wife Freda West Village,7.4,"If you've been to the original Jack's Wife Freda in Nolita, you know the formula: simple, almost healthy Mediterranean food, served to and by attractive people who are all crammed into a very, very small space.
At the new location, everything is much the same. The menu, in fact, is exactly the same. The food, though not revolutionary, is solid. So many brunch spots are either overly ambitious (don't really need pork belly on that Eggs Benedict, thanks) or characterized by watery eggs and hungover waiters, so credit to Jack's Wife Freda for offering pleasant things - a very good Greek salad, some moderately interesting egg dishes - for lunch, every day of the week. Dinner works too, for something uncomplicated like a plain grilled fish or a bowl of mussels, though the environment dies down a little at night. Again, it's same deal as the original, down to the communal table running through the middle of the space. If they wanted to start franchising the concept around the country, it'd probably work.
The one major difference, and this is important, is the size of the place. The new West Village location is about three times the size of the original, which means the tables are much more spread out. In Nolita, you're basically sitting on top of the people next to you. Whether or not you'll enjoy that depends on how much you enjoy hearing the people next to you talk about how a girl they went to high school with now has 500,000 followers on Instagram. We personally say +1 to having enough room for everyone to actually place down their Alexander Wang backpcks. It means you only have to hear the people at your own table talk about people with outsized Instagram accounts. Better, for sure.
The bigger space also means the service is a little less hectic, the seats are more comfortable, and the waits are shorter. In other words: just like the original, but slightly upgraded."

",2.0,Japanese,Soba-ya,7.8,"When you stack New York against LA, New York has plenty going for it, for sure. We have reasonable public transportation, actual seasons, the ability to get wasted on a weeknight without much consequence, and far fewer friends begging you to come see their improv shows.
One place in which New York is beat, however, is in the raw fish over rice bowl category.
Before you say, ""Uh, what?"" hear me out: I know, you're used to hearing about LA's burritos and their Korean food and their outrageous chef's choice sushi dinners. But head to the west coast these days and you'll find an abundance of simple sashimi rice bowls and Hawaiian ""poke bowls."" You'll find them in various Japanese restaurants and in a number of competing fast casual ""Chipotle of raw fish rice bowls"" places, and there are even food trucks dedicated to them. They're everywhere, and they're delicious. On our last trip to LA, we ate five.
For reasons we can't quite understand, the craze hasn't hit New York yet. So when we find ourselves intrigued by the idea of eating raw fish over rice for lunch or dinner (AND WHO DOESN'T), we head to Soba-ya, a little traditional Japanese restaurant on 9th Street.
As the name indicates, the restaurant's speciality is soba, and that's very good here too. A man makes the soba fresh from a glassed-in station at the front of the space a couple times a day, and if you're lucky, you'll get to watch him do it from start to finish. So by all means, order a bowl of soba -in a soup with a bunch of stuff thrown in or cold and topped with a few light toppings. You'll be happy.
But what we keep coming back for here are the rice bowls. There versions topped with chicken or eel, but the raw fish is where it's at. The fish is extremely fresh, and for $10-$20 depending on size, also a pretty good deal.
Is it the best iteration of raw fish over rice in New York City? Who knows. Maybe not. But it's the one we find ourselves coming back to on random Wednesdays for easy, reasonable, not unhealthy dinners. Until we get on another plane to California, we'll see you there."

",3.0,American,Houseman,8.6,"The area around Houseman can do things to you. There’s something about the way the light comes through from the river and hits the buildings, and there’s something about the quietness and the lack of people. There’s something about the beautifully designed stores with names you’ve never heard of but sell $2,000 sweaters. There’s something that makes you say, “Well, huh. This is nice. I think?”
Is this restaurant located in Copenhagen? Oslo? Portland, Oregon? Negative. It’s located on Greenwich Street, in the area known as Hudson Square or West SoHo, or “that area between Tribeca and the West Village.” It’s an interesting area - not the touristy/pseudo-artist loft-y scene of SoHo, not quite the suit crowd of Tribeca, and not quite the “my dog has 12,000 Instagram followers” scene of the West Village. It’s somewhere sort of in the middle, and unless you live or work here, it’s also probably an area you’ve spent very little time in.
Why are we telling you all this? Not because we’re starting to review neighborhoods. But because it tells you a lot of what you need to know about Houseman. Like its neighborhood, Houseman has all the tenets of being trendy and sceney (seasonal menu, chefs who come from well-known restaurants, understated yet also very nice interior) but it’s just removed enough that instead, it feels like a neighborhood spot. By the way, the food is also really good.In addition to being reflective of the area around it in a broad sense, Houseman is also influenced by the outside environment in a more direct way. Each day, the weather (e.g. hot and rainy) is printed at the top of the menu, and, our server told us, that’s taken into account when thinking about the food. We’re not sure that rain changes what gets cooked, but we can say that on our visits, the food was just the kind of stuff you’d want to eat on a hot summer day. And we have to imagine the same will be true when it gets cold again. Winter is coming, friends.
The best way to describe Houseman is to say this: It’s a restaurant for adults. Not old people! But sane people who want a really good, interesting dinner topped off with incredibly friendly service. Want to try a pickled bluefish dish that could easily come from some tasting menu in Copenhagen, but also a killer, totally unfancy burger that is one of the best you’ll have this year? It sounds like we should hang out. It also sounds like you will like Houseman.
You’ll walk out saying, “Huh. Well, that was nice.”"

",3.0,American,Dante,8.2,"Dante is a new restaurant that’s not entirely a new restaurant. This space on MacDougal Street was home to Caffe Dante for over 100 years, only to recently close, much to the dismay of many Village residents who probably hate you because you are new here. Yes, even though you moved to the city in 2003.
The business has since been taken over by some Australians, and we’d love to call it a “reboot” or “revamp” or whatever the term is for when a restaurant changes completely except for the name, but we never visited original before it closed. So, we can’t tell you how this new establishment compares to Caffe Dante the first.What we can tell you is that whatever Caffe Dante was to its oldest and most loyal patrons, this new restaurant will hopefully be for a new generation of people. And as far as we can tell, Dante will be to small plates and cocktails what Blue Stone Lane is to breakfast and coffee for the young and social in this town. Neither place does anything particularly inventive on paper, but few know how to make things simultaneously look and taste as good.
New Dante is an aesthetically appealing spot best saved for nights when you’ll probably drink as much as you’ll eat. Not because the cocktails are better than the food - both menus have very high highlights. Moreso because Dante is a lively spot where people gather, whether it be for a casual meetup with friends, a first date where a full sit down dinner is probably going to be awkward, or a final stop for a negroni nightcap after dinner somewhere else. You can also use it during the day for a casual meetup of a different kind - coffee or brunch here are good decisions for a rendezvous when the sun is up. Just know that you’ll probably be tempted to do some day drinking.
Whatever you use Dante for, be glad that it’s here, for now. Because something else will eventually take its place. We just hope that when that time comes, we’ll still be around to complain about it. And so goes the circle of life."

",2.0,American,J.G. Melon Downtown,7.7,"When plans for a second location of the classic Upper East Side burger joint J.G. Melon were announced in late 2014, people had mixed reactions. Much like when a classic movie starts production on a sequel decades after the original, excitement was met with a great deal of skepticism. You can't just re-apply a formula for success with a completely different cast and crew and expect magic to happen. You'll end up with Dumb and Dumber: When Harry Met Lloyd.
Then again, maybe you can. Because as far as we can tell, the new J.G. Melon is an excellent copy of the first. The new spot on MacDougal Street is run by a few seasoned restaurateurs and one longtime manager of the original who licensed both the name and the watermelon trinkets from the 3rd Avenue location. Actually, they seem to have also licensed every other detail, from the burger recipe to the cottage fries to the sweet, dank smell of wet bar towels and stale beer. And after a few visits, we're happy to tell you that new J.G. Melon looks, feels, and tastes pretty much exactly like old J.G. Melon. So if this is a long overdue sequel, it's Herbie Fully Loaded. Cinema at its motherf*cking finest.
The new J.G. Melon owners are so committed to authenticity, there's even a bartender named George who will introduce himself to you with a handshake when you sit down. He is either from Staten Island and actually named George, or he's an actor from Maryland named Trevor. Either way, we're into it. You will be too."

",2.0,Burgers,Genuine Superette,3.7,"There are a lot of things in life that don't make sense. Like putting ketchup on your hot dog. Like Comedy Central letting John Oliver leave. Like the NY Knicks' entire existence. And like this ""California Kitchen"" in the middle of Little Italy called Genuine Superette.
There are so many things that don't make sense about Genuine Superette, but let's start with the location. This restaurant is right next to a place that sells cannoli and gelato to tourists. The ""new"" roadside diner theme might be less out of place on the Lower East Side or a few blocks up in Nolita, but here it looks like somebody stuck a Walmart in Colonial Williamsburg.
Next, there's the food. Simply put, it's awful. From inedible burgers to greasy chicken sandwiches to bad french fries to salads that we're pretty sure were assembled by a team of toddlers, there's really no shortage of ways to build a bad meal here. Have it your way! Even in the middle of a weekday afternoon when this place is otherwise completely empty, we've found ourselves waiting long periods of time for someone to finally serve us a tray full of food that they clearly do not care about. It almost has the feel of a restaurant that nobody is managing - as if those salad-assembling toddlers are actually also the ones in charge and it's always nap time.
When you look at the sum of all the mixed up parts, this place isn't working. The general premise of a reasonably priced burger/sandwich/salad hangout center isn't bad, but it goes wrong in so many ways. In addition to the aforementioned food problems, the whole ordering process is problematic. Superette has gotten our order wrong more than they've gotten it right. The people behind the counter don't seem to know much about the menu, and while they're plenty nice and accommodating, that doesn't go too far when the two salads you ordered come with half of the wrong ingredients. As with most of the stuff that goes on here, it simply doesn't make much sense.
Superette certainly is genuine - genuinely not super."

Unsurprisingly, all of these establishments have graced us with their presence in the past year. Beyond that, you'll find Eataly, the original Shake Shack, and a Chopt filled with some startup's business development team working on a group weight loss challenge. It's the picture of the 2000's so far, encapsulated in a neighborhood.
But in the midst of it all is Eisenberg's, an old school lunch counter that's been open since 1929. Sure, you might see some kids who just finished a coding class eating a matzo ball soup in the back, but you'll also find a guy eating a reuben alone at the counter who's been coming here weekly for the last 30 years.
The food is solid - more comforting than it is amazing. The turkey and pastrami aren't Katz's, but did you expect them to be? It's still a good sandwich.
Eisenberg's makes for a great takeout option, but if you can, pause your life for 15 minutes and grab a seat at the counter. There's something about the signed photos of celebrities, most of whom are Broadway actors you've never heard of, on the wall behind you; and the thick sandwich-topped plate in front of you that makes things feel right. Can you get that at the kale bowl place? Didn't think so."

We liked it when we first reviewed it back in 2012, and it has only gotten better with time. Crave is that ideal neighborhood restaurant, in a hood that desperately needed one. It’s Perfect For pretty much anything - bring the family, go for a business lunch, hit it during happy hour, or use it for your next Date Night. Crave has you covered.
Crave is a fish-focused restaurant, and it’s refined enough to keep serious types happy while maintaining a laid-back, comfortable atmosphere that takes you out of the misery of Midtown East. They do some pretty interesting things with fish - like taking the usual supporting cast of hake, fluke, and swordfish and turning them into starring leads - but mainstays like the fried chicken leg and homemade cavatelli are home runs, too. There’s also an excellent oyster happy hour. And don’t sleep on the cookie for dessert. It’s one of the best chocolate chip cookies in NYC.
Placing all cards on the table, my younger brother is the GM at Crave. It’s only appropriate that I reveal this fact, as you’re going to have to take my word that there’s no collusion going on here. All I can tell you is that it’s a good thing his restaurant doesn’t suck, because I swear on my John Starks “The Dunk” t-shirt (that’s an important t-shirt), that I would have had no problem telling the truth if it did.
Don’t just take my word on it though. Listen to the people. We’ve sent thousands of people to Crave at this point - where to eat in Midtown East is one of the more popular restaurant queries we receive, especially now in Text Rex. It’s a crowd pleaser that has never failed us. It won’t fail you, either."

So if you want to eat some good food, drink some good drinks, and watch Sports On TV in a civilized environment that's not a brotastic steamfest, there aren't a lot of options in the area. Hudson Malone is the 1%.
Hudson Malone is a new-ish pub with a throwback vibe, an extensive menu, and an incredibly accommodating staff. It's a big, bi-level space that's certainly TV watching friendly. And they actually take their food seriously. Case in point: there's a custom Lafrieda blend burger on the menu and the owner that spent years running the bar around the corner at PJ Clarke's. They also love whiskey, and have a really nice selection of single malt, rye, and bourbon, including Pappy Van Winkle, which isn't even the most expensive neat on the menu (it's Michters 25 year rye, for inquiring minds). Sold yet?
We love hanging at Malone, not because the food is going to change your life, but mostly because all the people who work here are incredibly friendly. From the maitre d', to the bartender, to the servers - everyone seems happy to be here, and eager to help you enjoy your experience. Positive vibes are contagious, and happy employees generally yield happy customers.

No, this is not Oiji like the magic board from your childhood that allowed you to communicate with the spirit world at sleepovers. That’s Ouija, and by the way, it’s made by Hasbro. Pretty sure the underworld isn’t choosing to come to us via something sold at K-Mart.
This is Oiji, a very popular new “modern” Korean restaurant in the East Village. After reading that sentence, you’re probably thinking to yourself, “Did we really need another one of those?” All you need to do is have dinner here once to decide that yes, we absolutely did.
For all of the things that the countless “modern” “Asian” restaurants around town are, what they most often are not is good for any situation in which you’d like to accompany your meal with something other than one or seven light beers. That’s not to say that the Momofukus or Hanjans or Kang Ho Dong Baekjeongs of the world aren’t excellent restaurants. But name one that you’d order a nice bottle of wine from. Oiji is the kind of place that will have you thinking about what to drink that will pair well with your meal, not because you are a wine snob, but because the food here is so interesting and delicate and carefully prepared that an OB would seem inadequate for the occasion. Like wearing a dress shirt to work with “business shorts.” Nobody’s going to say anything to you, but you know deep down it’s not right.
I think the thing that impresses us most about Oiji is the fact that it feels so unique, even though the idea of another new Korean restaurant seems so ordinary. We have been absolutely floored by how good a few particular items from this menu are, ranging from a piece of smoked mackerel that you brush citrus soy onto with a tiny pine needle brush to an excellent and simple plate of fried chicken. It’s a more upscale experience than you probably expect from a restaurant on this block, and even though the room is tiny and cramped, you get the feeling that you’re going to have a special meal from the moment you sit down.
Now close your eyes, put your hands on the oxtail, and see if it moves. That’s the spirits telling you to eat it."

Bar Bolinas’ one thing is eating a burger outside. This Clinton Hill restaurant from the team behind Allswell does that very well. The burger here is a unique creation, mostly in that it’s served on Dutch Crunch bread, which has a sweet crust on the outside of the otherwise soft bun. It’s a very interesting, very good hamburger, and it comes with very good fries. It can be consumed anywhere in this small Myrtle Avenue restaurant, but it is best consumed on Bar Bolinas’ excellent patio, ideally for lunch when things are less crowded than they can be at night.
That’s not to say that there aren’t other good things to eat at Bar Bolinas. It’s a solid neighborhood restaurant with nice people, good drinks, and occasionally excellent desserts. But lots of places have those things. Nobody else has this burger and that patio.

There are dozens of places to stuff your face with hot bibimbap in Koreatown, but also a $180 Korean tasting menu in Tribeca where you can choose to add on an additional caviar course. Honestly, I don't know anyone who's actually been there. But it exists.
The places we get asked about most (and the places we find ourselves wanting to go to most) aren't those places at the extremes. Instead, they're the ones somewhere in the middle of the spectrum - the Hanjans, and Momofuku Noodle Bars, the Black Ants. Fun places, with great food. The kind of spots you'd bring a friend who's visiting town.
Until now, Vietnamese food in New York hasn't had much to offer in this category. On the cheap eats front, you can get a great banh mi in a jewelry shop, or an excellent bowl of pho up the block in Chinatown for about $7. On the higher end, there's midtown's Le Colonial, a great place to celebrate your grandmother's birthday; or Noho's Indochine, a great place to celebrate a fashion editor's twelve consecutive years subsisting primarily on bok choy. The closest thing we had to that middle ground was Ridgewood's Bun-Ker, which, while outstanding in all ways, isn't the kind of spot you can linger for hours over cocktails, and is the kind of spot where you can wear basketball shorts.
But now there's Park Slope's Bricolage. A nice, but not too nice Vietnamese restaurant. The chefs and owners are veterans of The Slanted Door, a place that has been doing the modern Vietnamese thing for years in San Francisco, and the food they're cooking is very good, if not super original or particularly mindblowing. At dinner, expect to eat spring rolls and sliced steak, while at lunch they're serving up banh mi and pho.
One thing that is at least somewhat mindblowing, however, is the excellent patio situation. The space is filled with salvaged wood and a bunch of cute plants - truly the stuff of Brooklyn wet dreams. It's the kind of place that makes you refer to plants as cute.
We can't quite qualify Bricolage as a must-visit, but we can award it the title of fun place to eat good Vietnamese food and drink nice cocktails on a cool patio. At least that's something we didn't have before."

So of course we went. And then we went back. And then we went back six(teen) more times. 
Out of nowhere, Acapulco Deli has become one of our most reliable Mexican spots. For the food, of course, but also for the fact that we can use it for so many meals.

The fact that there is no better place to get a burger and soak in some sun than on the back patio at Royale.
For the last decade, Royale has had one of the best burgers in Alphabet City. It’s not fancy, or made with brand-name meat, but it’s tried and true, both consistent and affordable. From the street, Royale doesn’t look like much, so it’s the kind of place you either know about or you don’t. And if you don’t know, now you know.

You walk into Belle Reve for the first time, thinking you’ve stumbled into one of those non-descript Tribeca bars on Church Street that’s been there forever but you’ve just never noticed it before. The place certainly has the look and feel of a random downtown New York shithole, but in a charming, “only in New York shithole” kind of way.
True to its New York uniqueness, it’s 10pm on a weeknight, they are still serving food, and there are several financial bros drinking at the bar. Nothing seems out of the ordinary yet, except for maybe the fact that the bros are wearing name tags, even though they are all probably named Alex. You sit down and order a beer from a friendly server, then peruse a menu that ranges from chips and guac and cajun shrimp to burrata and a lobster roll. Not usually a good sign, but you’re ok with it because everything else in this area is either very expensive or very bad and full of even more Alexes. You decide to take your chances with some burrata, the lobster roll, and a burger.
Now comes the first of a few surprises. Primarily, the food is far better than you expected it to be. Your burger is interesting (there’s deviled ham on top) and definitely satisfying. Burrata is never bad. Even the lobter roll is solid, and eating a lobster roll in a place like this would normally seem like a poor decision.
The next surprise comes when you realize that Belle Reve has not been there since the 80s, but only since the spring. You then learn that it is owned by some of the same people behind Employee’s Only and Macao Trading company, which partially explains what happens next.
As you are finishing your meal at about midnight, you notice that while you were focused on your food, the crowd has changed. There are a few tables around you, and they all seem to be filled with people in their 40s who still act like they are 20. The guy next to you looks a bit like Jeff Goldblum, and fittingly has two younger women with him. The table across from him is occupied by two couples, none of whom appear to have day jobs, because they don’t need them. The Alexes have fled, and the music seems to be much louder than it was when you walk in. You ask for the check, because you do have a day job and you are not Jeff Goldblum. And then it happens.
Right as you are putting your credit card away, one of the ladies at one of the tables has put Donna Summer’s “Bad Girls” on the jukebox. People are no longer sitting. The two tables next to you have turned into one big group. At first they are just dancing. But then there is kissing. Realizing that you are potentially about to be more than a spectator in a sport you aren’t good at, you get up and leave. As you walk out the door, another song comes on. This one is louder, and even more 70s sexy. There is giggling. Things are escalating.
As you get in the cab, part of you wishes you’d stayed. But you weren’t ready for that. All you wanted was a decent meal in Tribeca. You certainly got one. And you also got some surprises.
Maybe next time you’ll be a bit more prepared. Maybe next time, you’ll be Jeff Goldblum."

",1.0,Pizza,Prince Street Pizza,8.6,"A few months ago, we found ourselves walking through Little Italy, when we were stopped by a man and his son. With a sign for WORLD’S BEST CANNOLI framing his head, he asked, “Do you know where we can get some good pizza?” At an outdoor table to his left, an all-blonde family looked at their plates of spaghetti with an air of disappointment. Cue the sad music.
As a first step, this man and his son were going to have to get out of Little Italy. Aside from a mini FUGHEDDABOUTIT license plate keychain, there is not much in Little Italy proper worth your time these days. We knew we’d have to send him a few blocks north. So, where to? Without further guidance, they might have ended up at Lombardi’s, the city’s “oldest” pizzeria, but frankly, the pizza there is kind of gross. We could have sent them to Rubirosa, where the pizza is incredible, but they would have waited an hour for a table. We could have sent them to Pomodoro on Spring and Mulberry, a place that is allegedly known for a great vodka slice but in our experience is best known for people too drunk to realize their pizza is bad.
But this man and his son deserved the real deal - they needed to go to Prince Street Pizza.
The moral of that story is a simple one: if you’re in Soho/Noho/Nolita, and you need a classic slice joint, head to Prince Street Pizza. The location actually housed the very first OG Ray’s up until a few years back, but the newer Prince Street is much better, while still retaining that classic NYC pizza place charm (the cashier was talking about Frank Sinatra on our most recent visit, and pictures of B+ celebrities are on the wall. What more do you want in life?).
Are the regular cheese slices as good as Joe’s? Definitely not, but that’s not what you should order anyway. Get a spicy square slice (extra crispy), put on your I <3 NY shirt, and remember why you love this city."

",2.0,Sandwiches,BEC,7.6,"Fact - the bacon, egg, and cheese is one of the most satisfying things you can put in your mouth. It's synonymous with happiness and usually reserved as a lifeline the morning after a long night of drinking. However, nobody puts baby in the corner. The BEC deserves to be celebrated, and not just at your dirty corner bodega.
Did NYC need a specialty bacon, egg, and cheese focused Quick Eats restaurant? F*ck yes it did. Sure, BEC is kind of kitschy, but get over it. You're going to like it.
Here's what you need to know about BEC. It's a small, order-at-the-counter situation, and not a sit down, table service restaurant. It gets a little crazy during prime time hours, but it's open early and all day, so just don't go at noon on Sunday and you'll be fine. There are, like, 12 different bacon egg and cheese options, which is way too many and a daunting task to read through. Get the BEC Classic and add avocado. That's the move, don't overthink it. We've tried a lot of these things, and the simpler they are, the better.
Practical and delicious, that's what BEC is. It may not be as hip, cool, or x-rated as Eggslut in LA, but it does have excellent Instagram friendly floor patterns going for it, and judging by the flood of #EEEEEATS photos coming from this place, people are clearly taking advantage of it. The funny thing is: the best spot, with the best light, actually is in the corner."

",3.0,BBQ,Blue Smoke,8.2,"When I moved to New York in 2002, I did so in part because I wanted to eat in all the restaurants here. One place in particular was top of mind, mostly because I had read about it in Food And Wine or Readers Digest or some other ""magazine"" - a new BBQ spot from some young hotshot restaurateur named Danny Meyer. Two years later, fate had me living across the street.
To say that Blue Smoke is an Infatuation favorite would be an understatement. This restaurant is woven into my own personal history, and therefore the history of this website. I used to eat here at least twice a week, including on the first snow of every season, and for good reason. For the majority of the last decade, this was New York City's best BBQ restaurant. That, and I apparently have a weird obsession with weather-related rituals.
Since those days, I have moved out of the neighborhood, Blue Smoke has had a chef change and a menu overhaul, and the NYC BBQ scene is a whole different thing. There are now at least five other viable BBQ joints around NYC, many of which only exist because Blue Smoke and the Big Apple BBQ Festival paved the way for them. Is it still the best in town? We're not interested in having that conversation. All you need to concern yourself with is that the food here is still very good despite all the change. There's still nothing better than walking through that door, smelling the smoke, ordering up a bourbon from their extensive selection, and eating meat until you want to die a little. Or at least until the snow gods have been appeased."

",3.0,American,Craftbar,8.4,"If you have been around long enough to remember the original Craftbar, you’re probably not all that fond of Craftbar in its current form. The restaurant was originally opened in 2002 as a casual counterpoint to the upscale experience of Craft next door, and those who loved it would tell you it was a special little place that served simple, delicious food. A few years later, Colicchio and crew moved Craftbar around the corner to its current location, a much larger and, by all accounts, less magical space.
Luckily, we don’t have to deal with the inconvenience of nostalgia in this situation. We never went to the original Craftbar (my meals in 2002 still mostly consisted of frozen pizza and Bud Light), and previous to our visits in advance of writing this review, I think I had been here once over the last decade. As a result, we had no previous restaurant to compare this to, nor did we have any preconceived idea of what Craftbar should be. And that’s probably why we like it so much.
If you can manage to forget that this is a Tom Colicchio restaurant, regardless of whether that name means “guy from Top Chef” or “guy who started Gramercy Tavern” to you, you’ll find that Craftbar is simply an excellent, casual restaurant in an area that desperately needs more excellent casual restaurants. The menu ranges from light and vegetable focused to “we make our own sausage,” and we’ve found almost everything we’ve eaten to be interesting and highly delicious. It’s equally appropriate for a business lunch around Union Square as it is a post-work happy hour hang, and your parents will probably like it a lot too - assuming they weren’t regulars at the original Craftbar location."

",3.0,Japanese,Sushi Katsuei,8.1,"Let’s keep this simple: Sushi Katsuei serves the best sushi in Brooklyn. It’s also one of very few places in the city you can get a legit omakase experience for under $50.
For the most part, we could probably leave the review at that SparkNotes version: best sushi in the borough, at a price that won’t make you broke. But for those completists among you who actually read all of Crime And Punishment in school and still watch Grey’s Anatomy because you are NOT a quitter, here are the brief but unabridged details.
Sushi Katsuei is a pretty nondescript-looking sushi restaurant in Park Slope - white walls, carpeted floor, plain wood tables. It’s not a divey hole in the wall, but it’s also not the library-type setting of super serious Midtown sushi places. So on the surface, it’s nothing too notable.
What is notable, however, is the $45 omakase, which comes with 9 pieces of sushi and a toro hand roll. It’s not cheap, so it’s hard to call it a “deal,” but it’s just as good as, if not better than many places that charge twice as much for roughly the same thing.
Katsuei is basically the Brooklyn version of Sushi Dojo, which also serves a $45 omakase, but in the East Village. If we had to pick between the two? We’d hit up whichever is closer to your current location. Neither one is the kind of place you’d travel halfway across the world for, but both are definitely worth a few subway stops.
If you’re still reading, you know what to do. If you just skipped to the end, the summary still stands: best fancy sushi in Brooklyn."

",2.0,Burgers,Sel Rrose,6.6,"We hear from restaurant owners a lot, who try to convince us to check out, and ultimately review, their restaurants. We play hard to get. The only person who can actually drive us into a restaurant to check it out is you, the reader. If you have a great meal, tell us. We want to know. That being said, here's a tip for you, fine restauranteurs, on how to lure The Infatuation into reviewing your restaurant: open an oyster bar. You're pretty much guaranteed to have one of us sniffing around pretty quickly to see what's shucking. Some people pop pills or smoke weed for a good time. Our idea of elevating the fun is a dozen oysters and plenty of mignonette.
Sel Rrose is a couple of years old now, and was somehow hidden from us in plain sight. A cocktail bar with a full raw bar, and big selection of oysters across the street from Bowery Ballroom? Sign us up. It's a beautiful room that feels like an art studio where important people splatter paint onto walls and then sell them for lots of money. We dig the vibe. We also like that Sel Rrose is a serious oyster bar, with a full on raw bar room/nook/area (which is where you need to sit), and typically around 10 different kinds of oysters on the menu daily (that's a lot).
They've definitely got a lot going for them, but there's something just a little off about this place. Maybe it has something to do with the double ""r"" in their name. For example, on a recent visit, after our server neglected to bring us an oyster menu, we simply told him to deliver us a couple dozen, a variety of whatever was fresh, and we made it pretty clear we were excited about it. He came back with two big platters, but had no idea which oyster was which, or any desire to figure it out. We asked questions, he simply shrugged, said he was sorry he forgot, and then went back to eating his own burger behind the cash register. Come on Sel Rrose people, THIS IS HOW WE PARTY. We will say, the Sel Rrose burger is pretty damn good. Maybe he was just preoccupied.
Still, it just seems to be the approach to service is more cool than chummy, with minimal respect being given to the oyster foundation we had hoped they'd be a part of. A turn off, to say the least. Although everything didn't turn up r-roses for Sel Rrose, we'd definitely come back. They have a 1$ oyster happy hour from 5-7pm daily. Just don't expect an oyster education."

",1.0,Tacos,Tacoway Beach,8.3,"If you want to eat the best fish tacos in NYC, you're going to have to get out of Manhattan and hit the beach - Rockaway Beach in Queens, the last stop on the A Train. Here you'll find Tacoway Beach (a restaurant, not a beach, located inside of a surf club). Confused? Allow us to explain.
After last season, the original Rockaway Taco permanently closed. They have since reopened inside of Rockaway Beach Surf Club, and changed their name to Tacoway Beach. Don't worry - the food is exactly the same as it used to be. It's still the same ownership, still serving the same excellent tacos. But this situation is a serious upgrade in terms of setup as compared to the old location. In addition to the taco stand, there are two bars - one inside, and one outside - and plenty of seating for optimal taco consumption.
The scene at Tacoway Beach is also quite ridiculous. Located a block from the water, it's a melting pot of humanity in the best possible way. Surfers, hipsters, locals - all the cool kids hang out here. If there's one place to be in Rockaway, this is it."

Go ahead, reminisce about that one time you were in paradise.
And now, bring yourself back.
Because you should know that you'll experience exactly zero of those Hawaiian things at Noreetuh, a new Hawaiian restaurant on 1st Avenue.
Instead, you'll find a little, almost starkly decorated space that looks like a lot of other East Village restaurants. If you were expecting leis and floral patterns, there's probably something for you in Times Square. But if you like raw tuna and pork belly, you're going to like Noreetuh. If you like monkfish liver and uni, you're going to like it a lot.
Because there are very few other Hawaiian restaurants in New York and this city requires three ""thinkpieces"" to fully process any new novelty, a lot of the attention surrounding Noreetuh has focused on ""what Hawaiian food is."" As far as Noreetuh interprets it, it's essentially fusion, with a heavy emphasis on seafood and Japanese/Korean influences.
The menu ranges from the mildly adventurous (a corned beef tongue ""musubi,"" basically a sushi handroll) to the ""yes, your picky friend will eat this"" (garlic shrimp over rice). Overall, the plates are relatively small and the flavors subtle - you won't find anything too spicy or rich.
The restaurant has some quirks, like a Carly Rae Jepsen-heavy playlist, but it's a spot worth trying if you like interesting food at a non-outrageous price. Also, don't miss the wine list, which the restaurant takes pretty seriously - they'll recommend something great. Just don't come expecting a mai tai."

",2.0,Latin,Café Cortadito,4.5,"When we first reviewed Cafe Cortadito in the infancy of this website back in 2009, it had just opened and was a quaint, low-key Cuban joint that served excellent, authentic food. The menu remains pretty much untouched, but time has changed this place. Well, actually, brunch has changed this place. Significantly.
If this review were simply for dinner, it’d get a solid 7.5. Keep that in mind when you’re assessing the situation here. The Cuban dishes are just as they were - heavy-handed and tasty. The Ropa Vieja is still incredibly satisfying, and their chicken and yellow rice is a current Postmates go-to. Also, the empanadas, yuca fries, and sautéed chorizo with peppers and onions always get the job done right. What’s our problem then? Three words. Party. Time. Brunch.
We may be old (ish), but we’re young at heart. We can still get down like it’s spring break circa 2001, at least in our minds. What we’re trying to say is we can appreciate a good time, even if we’re not going to get hammered at 1pm on a Sunday anymore. However, under no circumstance is Party Time Brunch where they are blasting LMFAO’s “Sexy and I Know It” (in 2015) at levels that would leave an infant deaf in one ear a good time. Neither is serving “all you can drink” sangria that tastes like watered-down Hawaiian Punch, or soggy lobster eggs benedict with the texture of rubber.
During bottomless, boozy brunch, this place is unbearable. Even if we were still in the phase of our lives when this was the kind of thing we were looking for, Cafe Cortadito would be the last place we’d come to, other than their next door neighbor, Poco, which is even worse.
We’re really sorry to do this, Cafe Cortadito, but brunch is such a disaster that this review rating has to come down all the way to 4.5. If you at least changed the music to something a little more current and a little less awful, we’d be willing to bump it up a point. Blast us with something good! Just put on Jamie xx’s “I Know There’s Gonna Be (Good Times)” on repeat. It’ll make a big difference and your clientele would probably appreciate it."

",3.0,Mexican,Casa Enrique,9.0,"There are a few things that Casa Enrique definitely is not:


new


“white hot”


big on Instagram


in Manhattan


And yet despite such serious deficiencies, this Long Island City restaurant is packed every night with loyal neighborhood regulars and smart destination eaters. Why? Because of one particular thing that Casa Enrique absolutely is - the best Mexican food in New York City.
As you let that statement sink in, keep in mind that we’re trying to use fewer superlatives these days, especially when it comes to calling a restaurant the “best” of anything. “Things” change too quickly in this town, and as soon as one restaurant gets deemed the king, something else opens that does it better. That, or it ends up closing to make room for a condo with a froyo chain in the lobby. Viva la Williamsburg.
But in this instance, we feel comfortable calling Casa Enrique the best. Why? Because it definitely is the best right now, and new Mexican restaurants don’t come around in this town very often. Sure, we’ll get a Cosme every once in a while. But that’s not the kind of Mexican food we’re talking about. Neither is Empellón Cocina, or any other restaurant that puts pistachios in their guacamole. We’re talking real Mexican food, with chips and salsa and entrees made entirely of cheese, and we see no impending threat to Casa Enrique’s crown. Neither does the Michelin Guide, who handed them one star this year - the first to ever go to a Mexican restaurant in NYC.
So what earns a small Queens restaurant built inside of a house such high honors from The Infatuation and a tire company? Quality food, authenticity, and simplicity. The Casa Enrique menu is not complicated, and it’s certainly not “on trend.” You’ll find familiar things like enchiladas and chile rellenos and crab tostadas that are so well put together you’ll wish you could wear one as a tiny hat. What you won’t find are fusions of any kind or New York City interpretations of Mexican cuisine. That means no weird sh*t in your guacamole, and nobody claiming that carrot is the new corn. Just excellent food in a really nice environment, served to you by friendly people.
For us, that’s enough to break out the superlatives."

The struggle has become a daily source of comedic relief around the Infatuation offices. As far as I'm concerned, it's Boo-borg. Sorry, I took Spanish in high school, not French. And I struggled with that language too.
But on to the restaurant.
Le District, the new marketplace at Brookfield Place in the Financial District, was billed as ""French Eataly."" Strong words, as Eataly is the gold standard by which all other indoor marketplaces will be judged. Eataly is impressive. In size, in quality, and in variety. There are so many different food and booze activities and experiences in there, you can spend an entire day there competing with your friends in some kind of hedonistic EEEEEATS Olympics. Le District is the complete opposite. It's small, it's about as compelling as the new Duane Reade ""fresh produce"" sections, and overall, it's remarkably unimpressive. Likewise, so is the French bistro that opened inside of it, Beaubourg.
Let it be known, my inability to pronounce the name of this restaurant had zero effect on the actual review. Beaubourg did this to itself - with suspect food and horrible service. It doesn't help that the room also feels like a bad hotel restaurant.
Our server at Beaubourg was one of the worst we've ever encountered: he rolled up, and the first thing he said, in a non-sarcastic, totally serious tone, was: ""OK, I'm going to run through this menu, but I'm only doing it once, so pay attention."" Since the menu is stupidly written in French, apparently he'd grown annoyed with people asking tons of questions. Nice goatee, by the way. He was not pleased when we asked him a couple questions about the wine, and he also didn't take well to additional questions about the menu. His response to ""what's good here"" was, obviously, ""everything."" How's the pasta? ""About as good as pasta can get."" Cool. Very helpful. And it wasn't just his arrogance that irked us. The whole evening was a comedy of service errors: forgotten beverages, neglected small plate and silverware requests, promised bread that never showed. The only thing he seemed to be paying attention to was the hostess, whose pants he was trying to enter all night long.
The food didn't help out the situation, either. You can get better French-inspired eats at pretty much any French-inspired restaurant in NYC. Even with good service, Boo-borg would have still been pretty bad. Don't go out of your way to eat here, although we won't hate on you for coming to get drinks outside. They have a pretty excellent outdoor/patio situation with views of the Hudson. Maybe you'll have better luck than we did."

In return, they agreed to let me off the hook for putting butter on my fried chicken.
In case you aren’t already familiar, The Commodore is a Williamsburg restaurant by Pies ‘n’ Thighs alum Stephen Tanner, and it’s bad for you. Bad because merely looking at the food here will jack up your cholesterol thirty points, and worse because everything is so good that you’ll crave it all the time. Eventually you too will be cutting imaginary deals with your organs to justify frequent visits.
But before you ask the bartender to crush up some Lipitor into your frozen drink, there are a few drawbacks you should be aware of. First of all, this place can be a shit show in the absolute worst way. After 9pm it turns into pretty much the worst bar ever, packed with people who probably moved to Williamsburg because they heard about it on Two Broke Girls. Even if you’re there early, ordering food can be kind of a pain in the ass, and finding somewhere in the place to eat it is another challenge entirely. There is no hostess and there are no waiters, so basically you order from a window and then it’s a free for all between you and all of Brooklyn for one of the few tables. We ate our food off a Pac Man machine last time we were here.
The good news is that none of it will bother you too much, assuming your main goal is to eat some excellent fried chicken and suck back a few Commodores (piña colada with an amaretto float) while you wait. Those things are dangerous. So much so that I have now entered into negotiations with my liver.

Encouraging peaceful endeavors was his way of putting some karmic balance back into the world after putting something that could be used for violence into it.
What does that have to do with this restaurant review? Pizza Beach is our dynamite. This new Upper East Side restaurant is basically an indirect result of the current Instagram food culture that we have so proudly helped create, and now we're here to apologize for it. Not because we regret building massive community around a hashtag called #EEEEEATS - but we're sorry that there have been unintended consequences.
You see, Pizza Beach, a trendy new spot on the Upper East Side, is not good. The food is mediocre at best, the service is spotty, and the place has about twice as many tables as the square footage should comfortably allow. But the style and aesthetic of this restaurant are so perfectly targeted to the food porn generation that the mostly post-college clientele couldn't care less about any of those things. This place is absolutely packed every day with people who are too busy posting a photo to notice.
Now, we are obviously not accountable for the things that come out of Pizza Beach's kitchen, and we are certainly not claiming responsibility for creating the kind of person that values followers over food quality - The Infatuation audience is much more discerning than that. But, much like Sir Nobel, we do feel the need to take action.
That's why we're creating the #PizzaPeacePrize. Take a picture of a pie that actually tastes good, even though it's not pretty, and we'll repost the best one on @infatuation.

No one else moves buckets of crabs around these parts on the regular. Strap on a bib and get those crackers ready, you’ve got work to do. Second, the rickety, beach-themed bi-level indoor/outdoor restaurant looks like it belongs on a boardwalk, in the sand, or on a dock. Not steps from the Hudson River in the flourishing industrial capital of Red Hook. It’s a fish out of water in the best possible way. Third, it has a mini golf course. That’s right, mini golf. In NYC.
We like Brooklyn Crab a lot more as a place to hang out than as a culinary destination - sometimes, the idea of eating buckets of crabs can seem more exciting in theory than in practice, and that’s definitely the case here. But it’s still a fun activity, especially when you consider this place is more about than experience than it is the food anyway. Keep in mind that it can get bananas during prime time summer days, and you might have to wait a lonooong time to actually get a table. That’s fine by us, as the bar space is plentiful and there is always a cast of characters around to keep you entertained. Just prepare accordingly and make a day of it. While you’re killing time, have a drink around the corner at the historic Sunny’s Bar, one of the oldest and most storied in all of New York.

You can chill, take in the sights, and try not to get drilled by the heater
that's blasting hot air underneath your table even though it's beautiful
outside. From happy hour through dinner on nice days, this place is off the
chain. Packed. So much action. At those moments, the scene transforms into
some Jersey Shore meets Surf Lodge meets The Boardy Barn (does that place
still exist?) scene. After 10pm, people seem to clear out, and you're left
with a big empty room that's still got some modern remix of Darude
""Sandstorm"" with
Chris Brown ""rapping"" turned all the way up. FiDi is not a late night kind of
scene, but they do serve a limited late night menu here just in case you find
yourself hungry for oysters and calamari at 3AM.
If we're being honest, without the overall setting, Pier A is probably gets a
6.0 rating. It's the kind of place you should go once, just to see it. Go
with your friends for drinks and some light bites. It's an impressive space,
and very different from the kind you're used to hanging out at in New York.
Plus, you can call your parents and tell them you went sightseeing. Just leave
out the part about the 8 beers you pounded in the process."

",2.0,Japanese,Dojo Izakaya,6.8,"Recently, I was listening to a podcast about happiness (Sorry. I know. Up next, we can talk about our favorite NPR shows and professional American soccer) where the host explained that there are two types of people in the world: ""maximizers"" and ""satisficers."" Maximizers are obsessed with finding the very best in life at all times, while satisficers (yes, that's a combination of ""satisfying"" and sufficing"") are usually happy with something that's pretty good.
If you read this website regularly, you're probably a maximizer - the person in your group of friends who considers restaurant menus required reading and plans for large group dinners as if they were job interviews.
So without getting too Malcolm Gladwell on you, consider this: Dojo Izakaya is a satisficer restaurant. It's satisfying and it suffices. It's not ""Perfect For"" Parents In Town or for Big Groups, but it is ""Perfect For"" having a good time with some pretty good food. It's also almost absurdly reasonable.
Dojo Izakaya is a sibling of the East Village's beloved Sushi Dojo, but it's more of a random cousin than a brother or sister. The Avenue B space is tiny, and the menu is made up of Japanese small plates.
All of this may sound like a backhanded compliment, but it's not. Dojo Izakaya is a fun little place with good bites and incredibly friendly service, where you can easily spend less than $40 a person including personal cans of sake per person. So next time you're looking furiously for a low key East Village spot, remember Dojo Izakaya. Also remember not to lose your sh*t every time you try to pick a place for dinner, you maximizer. It's going to be OK. We're here for you."

",2.0,Seafood,Maison Premiere,8.0,"We don’t fawn over cocktails, as our general feelings on the subject are that most of them are fine, not worth the crazy price points, and certainly not worth getting excited about. Maison Premiere’s cocktails, that’s a different story. If you want to drink fancy in NYC, there is no place better to do it than MP. They put on a show we’re totally fine with buying tickets for, over and over again. In addition to being in a class of their own when it comes to drinks, they also own the best daily selection of oysters in Brooklyn. Maison Premiere has evolved a lot since we first reviewed it back in 2011, but they still take themselves very seriously, and our feeling that they could play a bar on the set of Deadwood remains very accurate. God damn, we miss that show.
Maison Premiere is both exactly the same and very different than it was when it first opened. It’s still an adult fun house of raw seafood and absinthe, but it’s added other elements as well. There’s now a full menu of cooked food, a sleeper brunch situation, and an amazing patio out back.
There are times when that whole old timey bar in the modern day schtick feels tired and played out. Not at Maison Premiere. As far as we’re concerned, no one has ever done it better. The careful attention to detail is impressive. Their bar is a work of art, and the bartenders wear three-piece vintage suits. The absinthe fountain is a near perfect replica of the one that once dripped in the Olde Absinthe House of New Orleans, and they even have pulleys to flush the toilet. Pro tip, if you’re there for a real meal, do not under any circumstance let them try and seat you at one of the front “tables.” There is no room for raw bar there. Wait it out for the back.
It’s character driven restaurants like Maison Premiere (and Marlow & Sons, Post Office, Fette Sau, Rye etc.) that make Williamsburg one of the best places to eat in NYC. When Maison Premiere opened, they were trying really hard to be something special. Now everyone is trying to be them. Looks like their plan worked."

Come to Quatorze Bis to observe this last group in its natural habitat. And also to eat the greatest goat cheese salad in America.
Quatorze is never particularly crowded, but in addition to the couples who've been married for 40+ years, you'll find an eclectic mix of neighborhood families at least pretending to enjoy each other's company and assorted others who just know there's no more reliable French bistro in the area where you can always get a table. In the 80s, Quatorze Bis actually used to be a hotspot on 14th Street, hence the name (""fourteen"" in French), but that's almost hard to believe, because it feels like it's been on 79th Street forever.
Quatorze is the kind of place you order the same thing every time - for us, it's always the goat cheese salad and half chicken with french fries, both always perfectly simple and satisfying. The prices are steep, but in this area, paying $6 more than you should for a chicken is kind of part of what you signed up for. Sorry.
Charming as the art deco posters and Parisian vibes are, this isn't a First/Early In The Game Spot, but it is definitely a shoe-in on the Dinner With The Parents shortlist. Keep it in your back pocket when the family gets hangry after a day at the museum or strenuous walking on Madison Avenue. Satiate them with liquor and the illusion of being on the Left Bank, and then go in on the french fries."

",3.0,American,Untitled at The Whitney,8.1,"Dinner in an art museum. Sounds about as exciting as a meal in a church, right? Maybe that depends on where you worship. If spending a Sunday at Gramercy Tavern feels like the Sabbath to you, you’re going to like it here at Untitled.
Untitled is Danny Meyer’s restaurant at the new Whitney Museum, just as it was in the old Whitney Museum. But this version is a much different piece of work, largely thanks to the fact that Gramercy Tavern’s Michael Anthony is the Executive Chef. The food at Untitled feels strongly influenced by the menu at Gramercy Tavern - most dishes are highly composed yet also very simple, and almost all have some sort of bright green sauce on the plate (that’s how you know it’s an authentic Michael Anthony). It’s all very familiar if you’ve ever spent an evening eating in the Gramercy Tavern bar, which we most definitely have. And everything we’ve eaten here so far has been nearly on that level.
The things that probably won’t be familiar to you at Untitled are the prices. The most expensive item on the menu on our most recent visit was a $27 lamb chop, and some of the small plates and starters cost as little as $12. For food of this caliber, and considering the fact that you are both in a museum and in the Meatpacking District, that’s a pretty good deal. You and your mom could definitely have a very nice dinner here and spend less than $100 - depending on whether or not she’s the type to go a little Lucille Bluth on the Sauvingon Blanc.
And while Untitled is most definitely an ideal spot for Dinner With The Parents, it’s also Perfect For several other situations, from a night out with the girls, to a night out with some clients, to a meal with your cousins who are visiting from Texas. There’s even some great outdoor seating, which makes it an excellent spot to watch the all Meatpacking action walk by - forget about the art, that’s the real cultural entertainment on display here. Maybe we should eat in museums more often."

",3.0,Mexican,Javelina,5.7,"We finally have real Tex-Mex in New York City.
Or at least some people think so. Should you find yourself planning to eat at Javelina, a new Tex-Mexican restaurant in Gramercy, prepare to hear that statement a lot - both leading up to and during your meal.
If you're the type who researches your dinner before you eat it, you'll certainly come across several write-ups containing this very claim. As a matter of fact, Eater has seemed singlehandedly determined to make Javelina a success from the start - calling it a ""white hot sensation"" almost immediately after it opened, and even attesting to one menu item's Tex Mex legitimacy based on smell alone. Maybe the nose knows best. Or maybe they were just smelling some guaranteed pageviews.
As you are about to find out, we don't necessarily agree that Javelina is the true arrival of San Antonio in Manhattan. But the Javelina staff (obviously) do, and they will be sure to mention it at some point during your meal. They might even go so far as to name all of the folks on payroll who are from the actual, real life state of Texas. I can appreciate some love for the Lone Star State - much of my family is there. But this particular tactic adds about as much credibility to the meal as a plastic cactus on the table might. Let's let the food speak for itself. Then again, the most Texan thing you could possibly do in this situation is boast about anything and everything from Texas, so maybe keep it up. Go Cowboys.
Those who tout Javelina's ultimate Tex-Mexiness will point to one key piece of evidence from the menu, known best to Mexican food fans and elementary level Spanish speakers as ""queso."" Javelina has several varieties of queso on the menu, from ""yellow"" to ""white"" to a Texas classic called Bob Armstrong dip, which is basically Velveeta plus guac plus sour cream. Is it good? Of course it is. There is no such thing as bad melted cheese. But we also aren't ready to tell you to line up at Javelina to get your hands on the stuff. Other restaurants in town serve queso - and they are just as authentic to TexMexico as whatever you'll eat here. Alternatively, you could just fire up the microwave and serve some to yourself.
Beyond the queso, we've found the menu at Javelina to be full of hits and misses. I had a chile relleno here the other day that was excellent. Most of the tacos are a snooze. The enchiladas are fine, and the fajitas are satisfying. But there's one thing I can't get past, and it is undeniably affecting my opinion of this restaurant - the chips and salsa suck. Anyone who knows anything about a true Tex-Mex meal knows that 75% of the experience is eating so many fcking chips and so much salsa that you can hardly look at your enchiladas once they arrive because your mouth is on fire and you're so full you could barf. I've never been able to exercise will power when a basket of salty chips and good salsa is in front of me - I will shovel that sht into my mouth until man or divine intervention puts a stop to me. At Javelina I hit it and quit it with ease. The salsa is bland and the chips need salt. That's a cardinal sin in my book. And if I'm not excited about my entree with my appetite at full strength, what does that say? Probably that if I want to eat this food, I should just go to Texas.
Then again, this entire discussion operates on the assumption that you'll actually manage to get a table at Javelina, which you won't. Thanks to all that ""real Tex Mex in New York City"" hype, reservations are near impossible. Sorry, Cowboy fans."

",2.0,Bar Food,Porchlight,7.7,"We don’t often review bars here at The Infatuation, especially ones on the far west side of the city. As a matter of fact, before making my way across town to check out Porchlight, I was 99% sure that 11th Avenue was an NYC urban legend, like buildings that don’t have a 13th floor, or sewer gators.
So if we don’t cover cocktails and we hardly ever come to this part of NYC, why are we reviewing Porchlight? Because Porchlight isn’t just a bar. Porchlight is a drinking establishment brought to you by the king of hospitality and hamburgers, Danny Meyer. And as we suspected, it’s better than your average mixology spot, thanks not only to the cocktails, but also the details. The drinks are well-crafted, the service is top notch, and we’re big fans of the space that Porchlight occupies, which is ideally situated for both a two-person meet up and a ten-person get-together, thanks to a game room in the back.
Being that the point of our platform is food, and that we’re not sure what to say about drinks beyond taking every opportunity we can to use the word “swizzle,” let’s talk about what Porchlight offers to eat. The menu is a collection of what we’ll call Cajun bar bites, consisting of small plates like boudin balls, frog legs, and fried oysters. And while none of it will particularly blow your mind, all of it will serve as an excellent accompaniment to a stiff drink and a discussion with a friend about how much you hate your boss, or whether or not alligators really do live under the street."

",2.0,Thai,Up Thai,7.1,"Any New York resident needs to know a few key places in his or her neighborhood. A bodega that actually melts the cheese on their egg sandwiches. A pizza place that's open late on weekends. A yoga studio where the instructors actually wear deodorant. And a pretty decent Thai place.
If you're on the Upper East Side, Up Thai should be that place.
First things first: the food. It's good! It's not SriPraPhai-good, and is sometimes a bit too sweet, but it also doesn't require a trip to Woodside. Considering this restaurant's location on the same block as the Upper East Side outpost of Bounce Sporting Club, it's a relatively impressive operation.
When evaluating local Thai spots, we like to run restaurants through our patented Solid Neighborhood Thai Restaurant Test, which features just one question - ""Would you eat anything other than pad thai here?"" Up Thai gets an A on that test. There's a whole menu of dishes worth ordering, from peanut-filled dumplings to excellent crispy duck, and that's what helps separate it from your run of the mill joints. With that in mind, dragging your human body over here rather than using your robot arm to press the Seamless buttons is worth considering because the more unusual dishes aren't totally primed for travel - a head-on fish or a ""Thai bouillabaisse"" suffer a bit from the delivery bag.
The other thing that separates it from the slew of Thai restaurants in the area? The space is done up like it's going to the prom. The prom in like, Texas. Or somewhere where the prom is taken seriously. You've got faux rustic brick walls, Persian lanterns, and plants hanging from the ceiling. Despite how that sounds, it actually manages to feel comfortable and almost borderline romantic, rather than like a West Elm that vomited on itself. And sure, the look may not make much sense, but neither does decorating every other Thai restaurant in town like a set for a live reenactment of The Jetsons.
Unless you really have a thing for Moroccan garden-inspired interior design, Up Thai isn't a place worth traveling out of the way for. But it's definitely worth having in your back pocket when you're in the area and you need to fill your veins with some Thai food."

",4.0,Pasta,Porsena,7.8,"This is a pasta-obsessed city, and I am a pasta-obsessed person. It’s pretty much my go-to order at any restaurant I visit, and luckily, every f*cking restaurant that I visit has pasta on the menu these days. Steakhouse? Have some bone marrow orecchiette. New American restaurant? What’s more new and American than garganelli? Scandanavian spot? Here’s some reindeer ravioli, served cold. We are truly living in wonderful times.
Pasta hasn’t always been this prolific, though. Back in 2010 when Porsena first opened, it was a relatively unique idea that a chef who was best known for a tiny East Village porchetta sandwich restaurant would open a new establishment entirely devoted to Italian noodles. Up to that point, most “pasta” restaurants also had “rasta” somewhere in the name. Rhyming = marketing, by the way.
We’ve always loved Porsena, and in fairness, should probably explain that this is technically a restaurant that serves Tuscan food - not just carbohydrates in sauce. But the pasta is what you should come for. For as long as we’ve been eating here, we can’t remember a single starchy bowl that we haven’t absolutely loved. In every instance, the noodles are cooked perfectly al dente, the sauces are flavorful and interesting, and the portion sizes are an ideal single serving. That was the case when we first reviewed it in 2011, and that’s still the case today.
What you aren’t coming to Porsena for is ambiance. The restaurant is basically brick walls and some tables. But that’s not to say there isn’t any charm. The staff is relaxed and super friendly, and it’s the perfect place for dining solo or catching up with some friends in a place that isn’t so loud you can’t hear each other. The food is good, the wine is good, and the East Village location is central and convenient.
The downside? Porsena is expensive. Each bowl of good stuff costs at least $20, and you’re gonna need a few of them. That means you can end up dropping some serious dollar on a meal that mostly consists of pasta. Worth it? That probably depends on how happy you are with our current state of noodle affairs. Thanks, Obama."

But you should know that we are currently bribing lobbying City Hall to provide each local resident one get-out-of-jail-free card, allowing a single instance of street shoving per year without consequence. Where did all these people come from? No idea. But feel free to give them all a friendly nudge toward Guys' American Kitchen next time you're in the neighborhood.
Now that you know that you can freely maneuver in Times Square with the proper blessing from local politicians, allow us to suggest you hurry up and get to Margon, a cafeteria-style Latin American restaurant with one of the city's best Cuban sandwiches, along with many other Latin delicacies.
Margon is no secret - at least to people who know what's what in this part of town. It's often just as crowded and sweaty as the inside of an Elmo costume, and for first timers, it can be a bit intimidating. Nobody is there to greet you, seat you, or ask you how they can help. There is an old dude who seems to have his eye on everything, but he doesn't really have teeth or speak English, so unfortunately you can't rely on him for much. Luckily, everyone is smiling, and they're happy to have you. Proceed with confidence.
When it comes to navigating an order, if you're just looking for a sandwich for the road, hit up the grill guy right when you walk in. But if you’re planning on sitting and staying a while (which you should), push through the crowd lining the lunch counter and take a seat at one of the rickety tables near the back. Lay claim to a couple chairs and then get back up in line (no waiters) and take a gander at the menu. And by menu, we mean steaming trays of food. Sure the offerings are listed up on the wall, but at Margon you can let your eyes do the ordering. Chicken, pork, fish. Roasted, stewed, fried. If it looks good, it is good. A lot of dishes are only available on a designated day of the week, but the regular staples are fully reliable, so you'll be good to go regardless of when you show.
Just make sure you're prepared to shove your way there."

Webster Hall pre-games, weekday lunches, weekend brunches, and early dinners

",1.0,Vegetarian,Beyond Sushi,7.5,"Delivery sushi sucks.
Not 100% of the time, but in a solid 7 out 10 instances, it tastes like it may or may not have been outside since yesterday. And no amount of spicy mayo, crunchy tempura flakes, or pop rocks can get rid of that taste. That's why ordering from a new sushi place on Seamless is a risk on the same level as attempting to domesticate an owl. You might be successful, but if you're not, you're probably going to have to move.
Well, we have a solution.
And when you first hear it, you're not going to like it.
Vegan sushi.
I know.
Let us explain.
Beyond Sushi is a little spot specializing in ""vegan sushi"" and some other healthy plant-based, Asian-inspired foods. Questionable as that may sound, a lot of the food turns out to be extremely satisfying. And tasty. And this is coming from someone who thinks people should receive a Nobel prize nomination for finishing a bottle of green juice. Bear with me. I'm converting you to vegan sushi, not Scientology.
The rolls combine things like mango and avocado and the occasional pickled carrot, for a result that tastes surprisingly like... sushi. Think of it as what you're probably looking for when you order from your local delivery, but removing the likelihood it'll be kind of funky.
We mostly rely on Beyond Sushi for delivery, and they know what they're doing in that regard. The spicy mayo-type concoction that accompanies bunch of the rolls comes in a little squeezable vial, a practice that all sushi places should immediately adopt. If you want to dine-in, there are tables, and even real plates off which to eat. We're talking here about the space on 14th Street, but there are also locations in Chelsea Market and on 55th and 6th, so get that into your midtown lunch rotation stat.
If you think a piece of mango sushi topped with vegan wasabi mayo sounds egregious, your qualms are entirely understood. But if you order the right things, it's better than the $7.50 3-roll special at that place you recognize from Seamless but have never actually seen in real life."

Therefore, you get the adorable name, pronounced ""chic kee toh."" What does ""chic kee toh"" mean? That two straight guys can never meet here for dinner. ""Dude, meet me at Txikito."" ""What? What is that?"" ""This super cute tapas joint in Chelsea.""
Aside from my hysterically immature observation about the name, Txikito really is a place best suited for a date. Spanish food in general is always a solid move for getting to know someone over dinner, what with the inherent shareability of small plates and the fact that you can pretend to be eating lightly but you actually just had your seventh meatball. Thanks for the illusion, tiny plate.
Txikito serves Spanish food from the Basque region of the country, so it's a bit different and more interesting than the nine other Spanish joints in this neighborhood. It's a quaint, fun spot with ample bar and dining room seating. The people are friendly, the wine list is interesting, and it's always lively. However, things can get expensive, fast. You wouldn't necessarily notice from the prices listed on the menu, but once you get eight plates deep into your meal, plus a bottle of wine, you're gonna be laying down some dough. The menu, by nature, can also be very hit-and-miss. I guess how much you'll like it depends on how much you typically expect to spend on a meal like this and how well you order. You can certainly find cheaper Spanish food in the area, probably even within a few blocks of here.
Speaking of nearby blocks, the area around 25th Street and 9th Avenue is and always has been a hotbed of First/Early in the Game Date destinations. Should Txikito not work out, there is always its new and improved sister restaurant, El Quinto Pino just around the corner. If El Quinto Pino is full, Co. is always there for a pizza and a bottle of wine. Still not feeling it? [Cookshop (http://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/cookshop) is close, and that place is essentially fail proof.

Sure, we’ve got plenty of landmarks of historical significance, but we also have The Spotted Pig and Raoul’s and Momofuku and the first ever Shake Shack. And let’s be honest - a city is only as great as the food that is in it. Anyone can build a museum.
To that end, I’d like to propose that we paint a red line on the street, just like they have in Boston, to lead you to all of our best and most significant restaurants. And I’d like for it to take you right past Cookshop.
Simply put, this restaurant has been one of our most excellent for a very long time now. We’ve been coming here for years, and it’s never been anything but delicious - not even once. The food is uncomplicated and as American as it gets, with all the menu items you’d expect to see at an American restaurant - pork chops, fish, roasted chicken, and brunch. There is no bad time to visit - even breakfast is solid here - and they also have a big outdoor space for the nine days in May and September that you can actually sit outside.

",2.0,Chinese,The Bao,8.2,"The first thing you notice when you walk into The Bao is what we recently learned is called a “live edge” wood table. It’s when the sides of the table are kept wavy, so it looks like an actual tree rather than a perfect rectangle. The main reason to have one of these tables is to give people the impression that you get your furniture from artisans in Vermont who make things out of salvaged wood.
The Bao has a huge live edge wood table running through the middle of the restaurant, which makes it stand out for a few reasons and also says a lot about the place.
For one, The Bao is on St. Marks, situated among the host of bong shops that seem to specialize in those smoking accessories that look like bottles of Sierra Mist.
Second, The Bao is known for having some of the city’s best soup dumplings. If you’ve made the soup dumpling rounds, you’re used to places like Joe’s Shanghai, where the most notable elements of style are the ceiling tiles like those in your 8th grade science classroom or Midtown office cubicle.
All of this is to say The Bao is a little different, and so are its soup dumplings, which are the primary reason to pay a visit. They’re much more delicate than what you’d find at Joe’s or other Chinatown faves, with a thinner skin and a lighter, less oily soup. They also come in a variety of flavors - in addition to the usual pork and crab meat, there’s a super spicy version and a wasabi version. In other words, they’re like the table - just a little bit fancy. We also happen to think they’re incredibly good.
These soup dumplings are now our favorite in the city, or at least in Manhattan, but the rest of the menu is worth trying, too. It’s full of classed up Chinese classics, so plan to get down with some pan-fried noodles that will make you wonder how you ever thought takeout lo mein was good at all.

It’s easy to get lost in conversation at dell’anima. The restaurant, for starters, is located right at that point in the West Village that we like to think of as the spot where the environment starts moving from “Oh This Is A Pretty Area” to “Let’s Make Out Right Now.” Pair that with a small space, dim lighting, and big glasses of wine, and you’re in business.

But there’s no question you’ll pause conversation at some point, look down at your plate, and applaud yourself for your life choices. Or at least your life choices for dinner tonight. Because the food here is really, really good.
That’s nothing new, as the Italian food at dell’anima has been excellent since the restaurant opened in 2007, but with time, it’s only gotten better. Pretty much everything that’s hit our table here has been cooked and seasoned perfectly. As a result, the board has convened and voted, and we’re bumping up dell’anima’s rating.
Dell’anima is always lively, but compared to its sister restaurants L’Apicio and L’Artusi, it’s a bit more laid back and casual, making it an all-time Infatuation Date Night favorite. If you bring a date here and don’t have a good time, that’s on you. If it’s going badly? You can always talk about how good the food is."

",2.0,Seafood,Fish,5.8,"This stretch of Bleecker Street has always been somewhat of a mystery to us. There are a handful of great restaurants around here, especially if you're heading to Cornelia Street. But there are also a whole bunch of random places that we walk by all the time and wonder who actually eats there. In a lot of cases, foot traffic and tourism seem to keep the lights on. But some restaurants manage to thrive on just one good idea. A gluten free risotto restaurant? Why not?
For Fish, that one good idea is their ""Red, White, and Blue"" special. Basically, it's six oysters or clams and a glass of house wine or PBR for eight bucks. That's a great deal, and the neighborhood definitely takes full advantage - Fish does a good business. We happen to love oysters and good deals, so we made our way in to check the place out. Unfortunately we weren't impressed. Other than that trademark special and decently priced lobsters, Fish was disappointing. We found pretty much everything we ordered to be supremely mediocre, and in some cases surprisingly bad. The crab cake and the lobster roll both lost out in popularity to the fries next to them on the plate. The ceviche was loaded with filler and somehow still bland. We definitely expected more from this neighborhood favorite. On the other hand though, this is one of those places that you can't be too overly critical of -you just have to know what it's good for: cheap oysters and a beer...and that's about it."

",4.0,Italian,Il Buco,8.8,"We try to keep things fresh here at The Infatuation. Most of the time that means staying on top of the latest New York City dining trends, whether it be the hottest new openings, that time we got another BBQ restaurant, or anytime anyone does literally anything with a donut. That’s what food writing is all about these days. Following trends and discussing them until they die.
Other times, keeping things fresh means going back to some of the oldest restaurant reviews in our system to see if anything has changed over the last five years - or at least just to take out all the references to LOST and The Black Eyed Peas. Is there a chance you’ll still understand what we meant when we said we wanted to “eat that gnocchi like Hurley alone in the hatch with a sack of candy bars?” Possibly. But we’d rather not take that risk.
Our original review for Il Buco contained no such reference, nor was there any mention of will.i.am, Fergie, or the girl in that group. But it was time for an updated review for one simple reason - this is still one of the absolute best restaurants in New York City, and we want to remind you of that.
We published our first Il Buco review back in 2009, but we never stopped eating here. It’s been in our Date Night rotation since basically the beginning of the decade, and it’s also at the top of our list when people visiting New York for the first time ask us where they should eat. Start with Il Buco, then fill in the rest. Why? Because there still just isn’t any place like it. Show me another restaurant in this town that was originally an antique store, has a 200-year-old wine cellar that Edgar Allen Poe used to chill in, and is so romantic that you’re pretty much guaranteed to see people trying to Fergie each other at the table if you hang around later than 10pm. It doesn’t exist.
That very fact is what led us to actually increase our rating on Il Buco, even though it is exactly the same as it always has been. This restaurant is still better and more special than almost everything that has opened up around it since 1994, and longevity and consistency have to count for something.
In this case, they count for half a point and a brand new review - one that’s full of fresh and topical references."

Any time we bring up the topic - whether it be in the context of a review or even just casual conversation - someone chimes in with some bullsh*t about why [insert popular ramen restaurant] is overrated, while [insert nearly identical ramen restaurant] is more authentic and in Queens and how dare you. Apparently two trips to Ippudo makes you Ivan Orkin.
Even though we eat a lot of the stuff, we certainly don't consider ourselves ramen experts. We're more of the mindset that good ramen is good ramen, no matter where you happen to find it. And Ramen Setagaya was the first place we ever found it. At least outside of a college dorm room.
Many years ago, when Ramen Setagaya was on 2nd Avenue, this was the first experience I had with ramen that didn't come in a dry brick with a packet of delicious sodium poison. My eyes were opened to the glory of porky broth, chewy noodles, and soft boiled egg. It then became a regular dinner destination, even after some of the newer spots opened up nearby.
Since then, Ramen Setagaya has moved to St. Marks, but everything else remains the same. We still love it most for its simplicity - you'll find no cheese ramen or ramen with corned beef here. Just traditional soups with really good noodles and plenty of cold Sapporo on hand to keep you occupied.
How does it fit in amongst the many other ramen places around town? I'd say that we're probably not qualified to answer that question beyond the fact that we're always happy with a meal here. But if you really want to know, we're betting you won't have any problem finding an ""expert."""

Celebrities can't stop talking about how much they love this place. EN is no newcomer though, nor is it the kind of restaurant we'd consider a hot spot anymore. EN Japanese Brasserie has been holding it down in the quiet southern part of the West Village for over a decade now. It’s one of those rare restaurants with incredible staying power.
There are few restaurant spaces in New York as spacious, sleek, and sprawling as EN, which, first and foremost, allows for a lot of versatility. You can do shoes-off, big group dining in one of the private rooms, or a romantic booth tucked in the back, or a low-key meal sitting at the counter overlooking the kitchen. You can have a multi-course tasting menu, cook washugyu short rib on a hot stone, or just come in for a quick bite of sushi. EN can be done in many different ways, and that’s certainly part of the appeal. It’s also big enough that you can pretty much always get in, too. 
One thing to know about EN is that it’s authentic. It’s actually owned by a small Japanese-based restaurant group, and this is their only outpost outside of home base. EN pays homage to Japan by showcasing the cuisine top to bottom, with a little bit of everything. From hot pots to raw fish to crazy uni bowls to impressive cuts of beef to fantastic fried chicken to miso black cod, to their signature homemade tofu. They've been making haute tofu since before tofu was hot. But for a restaurant that dabbles in volume, their batting average is impressively high.
EN is a solid option to keep in the tool belt for a variety of occasions. There’s a reason why it's remained relevant for over a decade. It’s consistent, reliable, and Perfect For pretty much anything.
This menu is so freaking long, it's impossible to do it justice in a food rundown. These are just some key dishes we often get, but you'll be good going with whatever your server suggests. Let them guide you."

What you do need is some world-class pizza, and that’s what you’re going to get at Totonno. But you are also going to meet homegrown royalty: The Mayor. Scan the framed walls and you’ll see photos of her throughout the years, as black and white turns to color. Even though much time has passed, little has changed. The Mayor still runs the show today, roaming the floor, taking the orders, and serving the pies.
Issue is, The Mayor doesn’t care. Not about you, not about any of it. She’s either drunk with power or just so completely jaded by her reign at the top that she does what she wants, when she wants.
That’s not to say she is angry or rude, because she is neither. It’s just, having overcome a number of obstacles over the years - including two fires and Hurricane Sandy - The Mayor is all business, with no use for time-consuming things like smiling or acknowledging your existence.
On a recent trip, we seated ourselves at one of the eight tables in the room and waited 15 minutes before The Mayor made her way over. It’s not that she didn’t see us - she just wasn’t ready until she was ready. Finally she arrived, threw down some Styrofoam plates and disposable cups, and hollered our two-word order - “large, plain” - at the kitchen. A total of 11 seconds of effort that took far longer than it needed to. But then lunch was served, and all was forgotten.
That’s the thing about Totonno. Nobody with working taste buds leaves an unhappy customer, and The Mayor knows this. So what’s the difference? The perfectly crispy crust is one of the best bottoms you’ll find on any pizza, anywhere, and the sweet red sauce is something straight out of an Italian wet dream. The fact that you can call ahead and carry it out to the boardwalk for a meal and an ocean view? Game over. What other politician can run on that kind of campaign? Four more years, every four years, for as long as they’re making the dough. The Mayor for President."

",4.0,Seafood,Lure Fishbar,8.2,"Establishing a hot restaurant in New York City is one thing. Maintaining it for over a decade is another. That’s exactly what chef/restaurateur Josh Capon has managed to do with Lure Fishbar. And so we are here to pay some respect.
Lure has been a Soho fixture since it opened in 2004. It has always been one of the cooler, more unique restaurant spaces in town, with a subterranean room designed to look like a really sweet boat. And what are sweet boats usually filled with? Models, celebrities, and rich people. No matter how old the boat is.
Beyond the clientele, Lure serves many functions: it’s where the bridge and tunnel crowd goes to turn up for dinner before hitting the club on Saturday night, and where downtown suits head for a business class lunch. It’s where the creative types go when someone else is paying, and it’s also the spot where locals hang at the bar for oysters and a burger. It’s quite the scene, and is still one of the best People Watching restaurants ever. No one really talks about Lure as a hot spot anymore, but business appears to better than ever.
Much of Lure’s menu is tried and true, and some of it has even improved with age. You can’t beat the crispy rice with spicy tuna, the lobster roll delivers, and the award-winning burgers are worth a visit in their own right. You can go steak, you can go fish, you can go raw bar, or you can just come to drink. The bottom line is that you’ll probably leave happy."

If you don't know them by name, you certainly know them by their work, most notably for creating what we now know as ""Brooklyn."" Frankies 457 was the first restaurant of its kind in this part of New York City, and what followed was a million copies of casual restaurants staffed by dudes that wear vests from Bed-Stuy to Paris. You're welcome, France. Enjoy the the mustaches.
Not that you need us to remind you, but Frankies 457 is still a fantastic restaurant if you can manage to get a table. It's a tiny, cozy joint with simple Italian cooking, and the food is consistently excellent. That's saying a lot, considering they've been doing this for over a decade. Also adding to the awesome is a very reasonably priced wine selection and playlists that are heavy on The Stones and Zeppelin. It's a nice place to linger, especially in the summer when the back garden is open. Downside? Tough to linger when you can't get a table. Waits can push well past an hour during prime time, sometimes close to two. Every once in a while you'll get lucky and sit sooner than you expect, but there isn't a ton of bar real estate, so you're just going to have to be OK taking a bit of a gamble. The bummer of it all is that without those unpredictable waits, this restaurant would be an absolutely ideal date spot.

",4.0,Steaks,American Cut,7.9,"Living in New York for almost thirteen years has messed me up. Among my many strange, city-inflicted maladies is a powerful irrational fear of of very large rooms, brought on by a decade-plus of existing exclusively in tiny spaces. There's something about having too much distance between my head and a ceiling that unsettles me. Example: I went to a Costco when I was in Dallas last year and almost lost my sh*t. Being in an airplane hangar full of socks and frozen pizza somehow just made me all too aware of my human insignificance.
Aside from the existential crisis, American Cut had a similar effect on me. This Tribeca steakhouse from Marc Forgione is absolutely massive, especially by downtown Manhattan/not Texas standards. If you're ever looking for somewhere to host dinner for about 400 bankers, this is it. You can also probably book that reservation two days out. The sheer size of this place makes tables easy to come by. Even big ones.
What's interesting is that even though American Cut is a frighteningly large steakhouse that is often half full of suits, we really like it. This restaurant is far more Forgione than it is Del Frisco's, and that means the food is good and inventive, even though it strays little from the standard ""steaks-equal-man-food"" blueprint. You will find the legendary Chili Lobster from their sister restaurant on the menu, and the sides and salads display creativity beyond creamed spinach. The service and wine list are also very good, and the room is warm and laid back. In many ways, American Cut reminds us of another favorite steak destination: Strip House. Hit it for the next time you need a big baller night out and a tomahawk chop - or just a reminder that the world is bigger than the inside of your studio apartment."

When there were no cool hotels around, and the area between Herald Square and Flatiron didn’t matter enough to have its own identity. These days, the “NoMad” is actually a hot area to live, work, vacation, and, believe it or not, eat in.
Hanjan was one of the first new guys to move into the now well-populated restaurant row on 26th Street. We’re big fans of Chef Hooni Kim, who executes Korean fare in a modern style in an environment that’s fun and welcoming. He’s essentially David Chang without the pork buns and the fanfare.
Hanjan picks up right where Kim’s other restaurant, Danji, left off. His food is absolutely delicious, and every time we return to Hanjan, which is often, it seems to get better and better. The salmon sashimi is one of our favorite raw fish dishes in NYC. Both the Spicy Rice Cake with Pork Fat and Kimchi and the Beef Brisket Fried Rice are automatic orders, and don’t sleep on the late night Korean ramen.
When it first opened, Hanjan was a solid new addition for the locals to frequent in an up-and-coming neighborhood. With time, it has grown into a fantastic restaurant, worth a trip on its own merit. If you love the food at restaurants like Momofuku Ssäm Bar, you’ll be thrilled to discover Hanjan."

At the time, Ken Friedman and April Bloomfield were the only ones feeding people properly in this neighborhood that would soon be deemed “NoMad,” so as to market it as something other than a slightly dangerous place to buy a suitcase on the street.
We were always kind of lukewarm on The Breslin, but The John Dory Oyster Bar has never let us down. That remains true today, and John Dory is a restaurant we still frequent fairly often, even with all the fresh new hot spots nearby. It’s the perfect place for a drinks and casual dinner meet up, be it with a potential client or a potential make out partner. And thanks to the fact that there are other good restaurants in this ’hood these days, the crowds here aren’t as annoying as they used to be. The John Dory is always full, but you can usually sneak in and grab a seat at the bar, if not a proper table.
Aside from a low-commitment food rendezvous, The John Dory Oyster Bar is also Perfect For all manner of daytime eating activities, be it a business lunch, some day drinking, or brunch on a summer Saturday at one of their outdoor tables. The food they serve from the ocean is always fresh, and the Oyster Pan Roast is still one of the best restaurant dishes in town.

",3.0,Korean,Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong,8.3,"On our first visit to Kang Ho Dong Baekjong, in the middle of our meal, the lights went out, “Gangnam Style"" started blasting, and a waiter brought out a massive birthday cake that said SoulCycle on it.
Some restaurants are all about familiarity and comfort. Others make you say, “I have no idea what exactly the hell is going on, but it’s incredible.” Kang Ho Dong Baekjong, the new Koreatown outpost of a beloved Korean barbecue spot with locations in Flushing and LA, falls squarely in the latter camp.
Even if you’re familiar with Korean barbecue, the Baekjong experience is something different. For starters, everything’s of really high quality: from the meats and the sides, to the friendly and super helpful servers, who actually cook the food for you at the grill on your table, unlike many Korean BBQ spots where you do it yourself. Sorry DIY dabblers, go make a terrarium when you get home. Then there are also the special smoke vacuum contraptions over every table that stop you from smelling like a firepit, as well as the ring of egg omelet batter and cheesy corn around your grill, which cooks slowly throughout the meal. And of course, there’s the sporadic eruption of “Gangnam Style"" (pretty sure it’s for birthdays).
The only downside is the perpetually long waits, but you can track your progress in line through an app, which gives you the freedom to check out some K-Town spots down the block while you wait. For a more refined time, check out Soju House around the corner, or for a decidedly not refined time, hit Pocha 32, where you can get liquor served out of a watermelon.
One tip: make sure to order one of the combos, or at least a selection of different meats. A big part of the fun here is the constant cooking, and if you stick to one or two items, you’ll miss out on the action. Pile it on, go with the flow. Sing the words to “Gangnam Style.""

On a recent trip across the pond, we were taking a stroll through Soho around lunch time hunting for food, obviously, when we happened upon an unusually large crowd. At first, we thought it was a theatre, or maybe a sneaker drop, or maybe they were giving away something awesome. Nope, it was just the average lunch queue at Burger & Lobster, the UK mini-chain of hip restaurants that just serves two different delicacies: burgers and lobsters. Duh. We popped our head in just for fun to see how long the wait was. In addition to the 40-50 people mulling on the skinny Soho sidewalk out front, another 20-30 were jammed into the waiting area at the front of the restaurant. It was 1:30pm already, too (sorry, 13:30), and the wait was an hour and a half. PEOPLE WERE WAITING A MINIMUM OF AN HOUR AND A HALF FOR A BURGER AND A LOBSTER ROLL. F*ck me.
New Yorkers now have the same opportunity. Burger & Lobster has landed on 19th Street, and is one of the hottest UK imports since, what, the Spice Girls? Burger & Lobster only serves three things and they’re all $20: a burger, a grilled or steamed lobster, and a lobster roll. $20, not a bad deal for either a massive lobster roll or a big-ass lobster. In this day and age, it isn’t bad for fully stacked burger, either. Neither their burgers (Nebraska), nor their lobsters (Nova Scotia) hail from London, thankfully, so don’t worry about that. And don’t worry about waiting, either. This restaurant is absolutely massive, with nearly 400 seats, which means it has restaurant game gigantism. It kind of feels like some strange food baby of Hillstone and Red Lobster. And, yes, that’s a compliment.
Is it worth the hype? By New York standards, that’d be a negative. The burger is impressive, and worth a trip to check out on its own merit, but the lobster isn’t exactly as exhilarating as we had hoped it’d be. That being said, we can certainly understand why people would freak out for something like this in London. It’s a great concept, and while the UK food scene is certainly evolving, this is super unique for their current restaurant landscape. Here in NYC, it just doesn’t stand out as much. We’re the mecca of burgers, have plenty of urban fish shacks, and stiff competition when it comes to lobster rolls (Luke, Mary, Pearl). Ultimately, if we want to get our surf on with a little bit of bunned-up turf, we’d rather spend a bit more money and go have a more New York restaurant experience at a place like Lure Fishbar.

The Happiest Hour took over the space that formally housed Kingswood, the popular Australian pretty people hang. Kingswood regulars won’t be disappointed, as Happiest Hour is an equally good time, and the food is better than Kingswood’s ever was. The space has a “tiki bar at the beach with pelicans in the water” kind of vibe - it’s the kind of spot where people could wear sunglasses inside, at night, and get away with it. We’re not saying you should actually wear sunglasses inside - you definitely shouldn’t. But if you insist, The Happiest Hour is the place to do it. After a couple cocktails, those rays will be coming down strong. The folks who own this place have been involved with such heavyweights as The Pegu Club, The NoMad, and Death & Co, so those drinks that are making the sun come out at 11pm, they’ve got some pedigree behind them.
Speaking of strong, The Happiest Burger is a F-I-N-E bar burger. We’ll get into it below, but the burger here is worth a trip alone. One thing we don’t quite understand are the cheap-o Halloween nurse outfits they have the servers wearing. They kind of say, “I just got out of the hospital at Miami Dade, and I’m downstairs eating some Jell-O,” as opposed to, “I want to bring a heavenly drink and some great food.” Weird, unflattering, and awkward. About as appealing as a grown man with pierced ears.
Nurse costumes aside, get The Happiest Hour on your radar for the next After Work Drinks or Girls’ Night Out occasion. For those times in your life when you just need a stiff drink and burger, The Happiest Hour is there for you."

""The Great Ramen Awakening."" First we had Momofuku, then we had Ippudo, then
came Totto Ramen followed by about 20 other places, and now I'm pretty sure
you can get tonkotsu lattes at Starbucks.
Our initial review at the time had us singing the praises of Totto's arrival

really f*cking good.
If you aren't yet familiar, Totto's style of ramen lies somewhere in between
the porky excessiveness of Ippudo and the basic, hangover curing magic of more
traditional spots like Rai Rai Ken. It's a chicken-based broth as opposed to pork, and
the noodles are thin. It all feels pretty authentic, and it's always
satisfying - especially if you can hit it for lunch.
But before you round up a crew from the office for some slurping, be aware
that this location of Totto is packed pretty much all of the time. Waits for
two are usually at least 45 minutes, and tables of three and four probably
should not be attempted during any normal meal hours. There is, however,
frequent availability for a single stool at the bar, so [perfect_for slug

Many of those meals ended up taking place at Danji, which remained in our heavy lunch rotation from 2011 when we wrote our first official review up until last summer.
Now that we work in the East Village, we don’t find ourselves at Danji quite as often. But it is the place we recommend most when people ask us where to have lunch in Midtown or Times Square - even with the arrival of a few other high quality options like Ippudo. Danji is just that place that you can almost always get into, and that will always be really good. You just have to know what to expect.
If you’re familiar with Korean food, the menu at Danji will be pretty straightforward. This is definitely Korean in the David Chang style, meaning lots of interpretations and interesting influences that show up in what are otherwise traditional Korean flavors. If you’ve had lunch at Momofuku Ssam, you’ve seen this playbook before.
That said, there isn’t much variety on the menu. Don’t bring someone who’s just looking for a light salad or something that will work with their Miami caveman protein-only diet. Bring someone who’s looking to go HAM on bulgogi sliders and bibimbap and then spend the rest of the day sleeping in the office. That’s how you do Danji.

After examining both perspectives on The Little Beet Table, we realized that we had a bit of a “he said, she said” situation on our hands. So we decided to combine them into one review.
Keep in mind that there was never much disagreement about the quality of the food at The Little Beet Table - it’s a solid restaurant serving dishes that won’t make you want to die after eating them. But it’s also a specific kind of “healthy restaurant food in a cute environment” experience. How much you like it probably just depends on your point of view. Here’s two of them.
“I love this place. It feels like Tim Burton stole the blueprint from the Garden of Eden, dragged it through The Spotted Pig’s meat locker, then challenged The Little Beet Table’s chef to make something of it. It’s not off-the-wall funky or overly heavy on the meat. And just like its Little Beet predecessor in Midtown, it has that healthy/farm fresh thing going, but a meal here won’t leave you starved or confused. It’s also got a sort of romantic, almost ABC Kitchen-like atmosphere with a cozier feel and a poppin’ bar area. I never thought I’d be this down with a restaurant in such close proximity to a bar that was once called The Hairy Monk.”

The space is the main thing you’ll notice at Sisters, located in Clinton Hill on the same stretch as pizza haven Emily (Sisters’ bar is a great spot to occupy yourself during Emily’s three-hour wait). But the food, which includes fresh, solid takes on the usual suspects like kale, burger, mac and cheese et al, is pretty good as well. At night, a DJ takes over in the back room, and the whole space turns into more of a bar and general place of drinking and hanging out. Hanging out can also happen here during the daytime - chill vibes and pretty people fill this place at all hours, whether that’s dudes in Steven
Alan plaid shirts or babies wearing sweaters much nicer than yours.
Those chill vibes, unfortunately, can also seep into the service at Sisters - no one exactly seems to be in charge, so figuring out how long you’ll have to wait for a table or getting a drink refill can be more challenging than they should be. But come to hang out, eat some farm-to-table-y comfort food, and then kidnap the people who designed this place and make them dress you in the morning."

",4.0,American,Minetta Tavern,8.7,"Restoring a classic is never an easy task, especially if it’s one of the most storied restaurants in the history of New York. Legend would have you believe that reasonably successful wordsmiths like Ernest Hemingway and E.E. Cummings frequented Minetta like their own clubhouse back in the day. Fact: booze has always fueled creativity. It’s no longer a writers’ haunt, that’s for sure, but the 21st-century iteration of Minetta Tavern is still a very special place.
Let’s backtrack to our first go-round at Minetta. The year was 2009, the same year we started writing restaurant reviews, and Minetta Tavern was by far and away the biggest restaurant opening of the year. Food media was completely enamored with the place. It was impossible to get in, they had a bouncer, and it was a MASSIVE deal that the “Black Label Burger” cost $26. These days, no one raises an eyebrow when burgers are on fancy restaurant menus, clocking in anywhere from $20-40. This is 1000% all Minetta Taven’s influence. We weren’t as in awe of Minetta like everyone else was, though. We liked it OK and felt like the hype outshined the actual restaurant experience. So we gave it a 7.7 rating.
Cut to 2015, and things done changed. Minetta is incredible these days. They’ve really hit their stride, and it’s everything we had hoped it would be back in 2009. The room has a special feeling that makes you feel f*cking fantastic, and the restaurant is Perfect For so many things. The bar is usually our move, because if you get there early, you can usually scoop a couple seats. Once settled, let it rip. Minetta’s bone marrow is mind blowing, and the Bone-In NY Strip is bananas. Plus, all that Black Label action. Straight up, Minetta Tavern is one of our absolute favorite restaurants. We can’t do it often, because then we’d be broke and really fat, but once or twice a year this is a treat-yo-self meat splurge you deserve. It’s also a sleeper for brunch, and if you want to get in without the hassle of trying to get a dinner reservation, just go for lunch and get a burger.
It took us a minute to find our happy place with Minetta, but we’re glad we realize how truly great this restaurant is now. Those legendary writers would be proud, although they probably wouldn’t be hanging here on the regular anymore. Imagine what $28 (current price) bought you in Hemingway’s day? More than a burger, that’s for sure."

",3.0,Italian,Santina,8.0,"I was midway through writing this Santina review about how the Meatpacking District has been changing for the best - the High Line! Bubby’s! A cool new food hall! But then I received the following unsolicited PR email with the subject line “VIP blogger night invite - Bagatelle the HOTTEST French restaurant in the Meatpacking district.” Yikes. Three steps forward, one step back.
Focusing on the positive, Santina is the best thing to happen to the Meatpacking District since meat was actually packed here (do they still do that?). It’s the latest in a slew of new releases from the fire-breathing trio known as Major Food Group, who are also behind hot spots like Carbone and Dirty French. They gutted a parking garage underneath the High Line, inserted floor to ceiling windows as walls, and decked the place out in sparkling party time palm trees and shells, creating a fun vibe that’s some kind of tropical Italy in Hawaii hits Meatpacking. Weird, but it works.
If you order right, you can have a great meal, but not everything on this menu is amazing. It’s actually a frustrating menu, because the dish listings offer no detail or descriptions. Even upon asking, the staff hasn’t fully mastered what’s what either, and that’s not necessarily their fault. Mass confusion that could easily be avoided. Santina would be a way better dining experience if they simply offered up a little more information for each dish. No one wants to ask for descriptions, we just want to know the key ingredients in a “Grigliata Del Giorno” are, ’cause f*ck if we know.
Santina is an unpretentious good time, and nowhere near as intense or intimidating as the rest of the Major roster. It’s the kind of place you can just roll into anytime without a reservation, test your luck on a table, but ultimately sit at the spacious bar for a meal. It’s fun, it’s easy, and it also doubles as easily the best cocktail bar in Meatpacking. Hang here instead of going to the horrible clubs that surround it. Soho House members, you just stepped in sh*t.
There were exactly zero restaurants we enjoyed hanging out in Meatpacking until Santina arrived. Now there’s one. Sorry, Bagatelle. Shirtless, 1pm table dancing is not in the cards for this crew. Apologize to your publicist for us."

",2.0,Vegetarian,Dirt Candy,8.4,"Back in 2011, we wrote a glowing review of the naughty veggie East Village spot Dirt Candy. “We’re as far from vegetarian as T-Rex,” the review said, “but we’ve got ultimate respect for chefs who can impress without the use of meat. Especially when the food is as satisfying as what Amanda Cohen has going on at Dirt Candy.”
Well, much in this world has changed since 2011. We’ve ditched the word “Immaculate,” gone bi-coastal, and fallen in and out of lust with bone broth. And in that time, Dirt Candy has relocated to a larger and more polished venue downtown where the food is still very good and the logistics have gotten even better.
The biggest change? Size. Both restaurant and menu have expanded dramatically from their once scrappy, lean roots to an all-white, sprawling dining room featuring a bar and full, diverse menu. The most delightful addition? Brussels sprouts tacos. The most confusing one? A 20% administrative fee in lieu of a tip. We failed Intro to Econ, so we’re going to forgo developing an opinion on that one. But the change that will take getting used to is the space. We had a little Stockholm Syndrome as we familiarized ourselves with the shiny new sign and high ceilings. Kind of like how I sometimes miss the bullies who tortured me in middle school, a piece of us longs for the wee little Dirt Candy where we used to wait months for a table.
We think we’ll get over that pretty quickly though, and so should you. This spot has Girls’ Night Out written all over it, but we encourage the gents to get down with it, too. It’s not every day you can eat a hot dog that replaces meat with broccoli and find it f*cking wonderful."

",3.0,Japanese,SakaMai,7.3,"In the late '70s or early '80s, sundried tomatoes ""arrived"" in America, and slowly but surely, they became the coolest thing in town. Restaurant after restaurant started adding them to dishes, because they were fancy and exotic and all around announced that you were classy. Do you remember going to a restaurant in the '90s? There were SO MANY SUNDRIED TOMATOES.
Fortunately, the '90s are over and no one has to subsist on sundried tomato and goat cheese paninis anymore (NOT HATIN'). But there is a quickly rising sundried tomato of our time (or at least of hip New York restaurants in 2015). It is sea urchin.
A couple years ago, sea urchin, or uni, was mostly known around these parts as an ""exotic"" kind of sushi - the type that divides tables and makes people say, ""That looks like a tongue."" (It does look like a tongue.) But now, sea urchin's all over the place - and it seems like every new restaurant serves some kind of uni dish. I'm pretty sure there are at least nine Italian restaurants that opened in the past two years which serve pasta with sea urchin.
If you're the kind of person who gets psyched up about uni as if it were a Pokémon card (GOTTA CATCH 'EM ALL!), you'll definitely be excited by Sakamai, a Lower East Side Japanese sake bar where a pretty high proportion of the menu includes the ol' sea urchin gonads. The rest of the menu is filled out by other rich, delicacy kind of foods that elicit similar fan-girling: bone marrow, caviar, foie gras.
But despite the over the top ingredients, SakaMai is a pretty relaxed place. It looks like a typical Lower East Side wine bar, straight down to the sake that's served in wine glasses, and nearly all of the plates are small and designed for sharing. For the most part, the rich ingredients are mixed into familiar Japanese-inspired dishes like hand rolls, meatballs, and ramen noodles, so it's not like you're not going to be straight up eating a plate of sea urchin and bone marrow.
How much you like this place will largely depend on how much you like to get down with the ingredients described above. There are both fancier and dive-ier places to eat this kind of Japanese bar food, where the food may be slightly better or slightly cheaper, but SakaMai's a nice Date Night kind of middle ground, and a good respite from the surrounding wine bars. You know, ones where they have sundried tomatoes."

",3.0,Pasta,Lupa,8.3,"In our first Lupa review back in 2010, we pointed out a dude wearing an Affliction blazer in the restaurant as proof that all Mario Batali establishments have some level of tourist appeal to them. The current-day anecdote would probably be something more along the lines of a group of people wearing the same Crossfit Convention t-shirts, but the analogy remains the same - people who look up to Vin Diesel really seem to love this place.
However, in the five years that have passed since that initial Lupa review, we’ve mastered the art of eating here and avoiding the crowds, and it’s really pretty much the way you avoid any bridge and tunnel or tourist situation in New York City - hit it on a Tuesday night.
Lupa’s near-Soho location and no-nonsense Roman-Italian menu make it a favorite among the neighborhood for a laid back meal, and we love this restaurant as a destination for that way-too-early-in-the-week dinner that you sort of want to cancel but can’t. Hit it for a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine instead of blowing up your week by accidentally going too hard at Dirty French. The staff is cool, the vibe in the room is excellent albeit a little cramped, and we always find ourselves satisfied with its consistency and efficiency. Play your cards right, and you might even make it home in time to live tweet The Bachelor, or maybe catch The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift on TBS. Whatever you’re into."

",1.0,American,Dirty Bird To-Go,7.2,"We don't think too often about chicken fingers. Before recently, the last time we'd had chicken fingers was probably in the buffet section at a company bowling outing to Chelsea Piers hosted by a company we didn't even work for. They were cold, and greasy but also dry, and tasted like bad room service. Also: weird and slimy inside. (We're talking about the chicken, not the people.)
But recently, we made a trip to Dirty Bird To-Go on 14th Street, and we can report that our view on the potential of the chicken finger has changed. Dirty Bird will convince you that the chicken finger deserves a better home than a warming station in the kid's food area at a bar mitzvah. It convinced us. The skin is crisp, the inside is just right, and most importantly: no weird slimy bits.
Dirty Bird, a little takeout spot with a few seats on 14th and 7th (there's a newer location in Tribeca, too), specializes in organic, quality chicken of all kinds - fried, rotisserie, even chicken salad - and those are all good too. You will be well-served here, whether you like your chicken on top of kale, with a side of kale, in a wrap, or on a bone and fried in buttermilk batter. Chicken, for all.
There's a crazy amount of chicken in New York these days - every other ""new American"" restaurant has a $26 fried chicken on its menu, a handful of places think they've reinvented the roasted bird (put foie gras under the skin!), and we're pretty sure a new NYC bylaw states that you can't open East Village/Lower East Side/Williamsburg brunch spot if fried chicken and waffles don't appear on the menu. So we won't say Dirty Bird is in the running for the city's best - it's simply a really good little takeout spot for chicken, should you find yourself near 14th Street and in the mood for some poultry. The chicken fingers might even be worth traveling for."

You see, they’ve somehow found a way to give off a warm, summer-y, homey vibe no matter how crowded it is or how much snow is dumping outside.

We won’t lie. The most accurate way to describe Cafe Clover’s menu is “chick food.” With “chick” being interchangeable with any term you have for humans of any gender who have an annual SoulCycle membership, attend Fashion Week events, and/or know every lyric on Michelle Branch’s break out album. All things we respect, but don’t necessarily dabble in.

",3.0,American,Prune,8.1,"We’re guessing that what you know about Prune probably has something to do with brunch. It also probably has something to do with waiting for brunch, because that’s what you’re going to do here. Standing outside of Prune for 45 minutes is as much a part of the experience of having a bloody mary and eggs benedict inside of it. But you probably also know that it’s going to be worth it, because this restaurant is what every other restaurant is trying to emulate when it comes to brunch. Not many do it better.
What you might not know is that Prune has a reputation that reaches far beyond the East Village. Back in our music business days, we used to hear the term, “artist’s artist” a lot, in reference to a musician who has the respect and admiration of other musicians, but is relatively unknown to the general public. Sort of like how that guy Paul McCartney influenced Kanye West. Prune’s chef and owner, Gabrielle Hamilton, is an artist’s artist. Or, I suppose more accurately, a chef’s chef. People in the restaurant industry hold both her and Prune in high regard, even though it’s probably not the first place that your mom has on her Hit List when she’s visiting for the weekend.
I bring that up because what you also might not know is that Prune is just as good for dinner as it is for the meal that it’s more popularly known for. At night this place is more of an American version of a tiny French bistro, and it has largely made its name on serving creative and interesting dishes that you won’t recognize from every other menu around town, but that you will absolutely want to eat. Like blistered squid with fresh made pork sausage. Or a giant roasted veal breast with potatoes. It’s as perfect a spot for Date Night or Dinner With The Parents as it is for Brunch, and we’ve even been known to hit it solo for a meal at the bar on a Sunday night.
Regardless of the time of day, we’ve never loved how cramped this restaurant is - they tend to pack as many people into their 200 square feet of space as humanly possible. But we’ve also never not loved a meal here. That’s probably why people keep showing up after 15 years in business. Having a reputation helps. But having really good food helps more."

",3.0,American,The Finch,8.3,"People love farms. Or at least they love the idea of them. Farms embody the spirit of the nation. Farms grow things that taste good. Farms have cool machines that sort of look like Transformers.
And yet that's probably the extent of what the average New Yorker knows about them. For most of us, the word ""farm"" has really become more of an adjective than noun, used to imply that something is ""good"" or ""probably not covered with Doritos.""
""Excuse me, what's in the omelette?""
""Three farm eggs and heirloom tomatoes.""
""Farm eggs, you say? I do want that. And throw in some farm fresh asparagus.""
We also like our restaurants to be farm-centric whenever possible. That was certainly a factor that piqued our interest when we found out that The Finch, a new restaurant in Clinton Hill, is owned by a chef who spent time at Blue Hill at Stone Barns. He spent time in a lot of other restaurants too, but Stone Barns is by far our favorite farm, so TELL ME MORE.
The Finch actually makes no claim to being a particularly farm-centric or farm-focused dining establishment, but it definitely feels like one. The restaurant occupies the entire bottom floor of a brownstone on Greene Avenue, but also seems like it could just as easily exist in the Hudson Valley next to its very own grain silo. There's a sort of warm, rustic comfort to this big and beautiful room, and it's the kind of place you want to hang out in long after your meal is over. There aren't many spaces in Brooklyn with a vibe this good, and the food is excellent too.
Despite never actually using the word, the menu at The Finch definitely has a Blue Hill-esque ""farm"" feel to it, in that each dish is all about the quality of the ingredients, rather than relying on some rich sauce or heavy handed seasoning to make an impression. For instance, we found ourselves surprised but appreciative of the fact that our squid ink pasta tasted like squid ink pasta and not just starch with lemon juice and chili pepper and butter and salt. We also appreciate that we saw no evidence of what we'll call ""farm flexing,"" in which some rare strain of basil from the Triassic period shows up on your plate to impress you even though it does indeed taste like dinosaur. Instead the flavors are mostly familiar and restrained, and almost exclusively enjoyable.
Maybe that's what we like most about The Finch. We didn't expect this place to be so good and yet so unassuming. Some might even call it modest in it's excellence, just like the hard working farmers this country was built on.
God Bless America."

Westville has been slinging vegetables since before it was cool to eat healthy.

There’s something for everyone here, and even though you’ll have to wait for a table during prime time, it’s always worth it.
Most importantly, Westville runs the most efficient delivery operation in all of NYC. The fastest time ever, so far? Nine minutes, 45 seconds. Granted, my apartment is three blocks away, but still, that is FAST. So fast that you wonder if they actually cook the food to order, or just have teriyaki salmon dishes lined up ready to be grabbed and stuffed into perfectly packed, tightly-knotted plastic bags at a moment’s notice.

",3.0,Pizza,SRO,5.6,"In preschool, a teacher found me irritating because I told her that I thought the class wasn't being run efficiently. There were too many rules, and they didn't make sense. It's not that I was an anarchist child, I just found that the rigid regulations at nap time did more harm than good.
This is the problem with SRO, a new pizza ""speakeasy"" on the Bowery. There are too many rules and they don't make sense.
SRO occupies the very small space that was previously Forcella's takeout counter - when Forcella had a fire last year, the main space reopened as a tapas restaurant called Espoleta, while the side space became SRO, a ""speakeasy"" serving a $38 ""pizza tasting menu."" Yes, a ""pizza tasting menu."" In a ""speakeasy.""
The needless rules begin as soon you try to make reservation, and the website advertises a ""password"" for entry, but all you really need to do is book through their online system and give your name at the host's stand for Espoleta. Assuming your table is ready (on one visit, it wasn't for 20 minutes), the host knocks on the door and flips a switch, turning on a little red light, which alerts the SRO people that you've arrived. After this series of steps, you're let into the little room that holds SRO, which stands for ""single room occupancy"" - a reference to the Bowery's history of tenement style housing with single room apartments. The little room is pretty cozy and charming, though it does get absurdly hot, which is what happens when you stick a 1000-degree pizza oven in a very small room.
When you've accomplished the feat of sitting down, you're presented with the only menu available - a $38 prix fixe situation that gets you a choice of an appetizer, one individual pizza, a dessert, and a glass of wine. If you add that up - say it's a $10 glass of wine, a $12 appetizer, a $15 pizza, a $10 dessert - it's an OK deal, I guess, but it's also not when you consider you don't actually want that Nutella pizza for dessert at all, or someone doesn't want that glass of wine.
Rules might be more allowable if the pizzas and appetizers were truly outstanding, but they're just not at all. The fried Montanara that made Forcella famous is still there, and the margherita pizza is solid enough, but the appetizers and specials run the gamut from OK to not good at all.
If you're the kind of person who perks up at the idea of a ""speakeasy,"" SRO might be your thing. Perhaps you also would have liked my preschool class. But there are too many other excellent pizza spots in the area - Motorino, Rubirosa, even Lil' Frankies - where the pizza is better and the doctrine is less stringent."

Are they trolling you when they ask if you're ready to order even though nobody has told you what they serve? Sort of. But are you going to love whatever fish hits the table? Goddamn right you are.
Because by not sticking to some pre-set, laminated list of entrées, Elias Corner is able to follow the golden rule of seafood - what's fresh is what's best - and deliver A+ fish on a nightly basis.
If there is no line when you show up, congrats. If there is, it shouldn't be long, so take a minute to game plan. You could go with a light bite and get a salad and some swordfish kabobs. Or maybe it's a sardines into octopus into St. Peter's kind of night (oof that sounds like a good night). Regardless, the lineup of fish in the front is what you are choosing from, so by all means, tap on the glass.
The dining room out here will be loaded with locals in their local state, so don't be surprised if tables are getting chummy with the waiters. But if it's your first time, the staff will do its best to treat you like a regular too. Even when the dining room is crowded, Elias promises the same casual and comfy meal.

",3.0,Japanese,Mu Ramen,8.6,"I am going to ask you a series of questions. This is important, so take your time and think hard before you answer.
Do you love ramen?
Is Ippudo your favorite place to eat ramen?
Do you sometimes wonder what the effects of eating ramen several times a week would have on your well being?
Are you interested in learning more about Queens?
Have you ever been convicted of a felony?
Ok, you don't have to answer that last one. I'm just trying to see what kind of creeps are out there reading our reviews. But if you found yourself responding in the affirmative to the first four queries, you should plan to pick up the phone at 3:00pm today and make a reservation for dinner tonight at Mu Ramen. Which probably leads you to some questions for me, like:
Really? Another ramen joint?
And I have to call at 3pm to get a same day reservation?
All the way out in Long Island City?
Why not just hit up any one of the 30 other ramen restaurants currently in my rotation?
Will there be a test?
These are all valid concerns, and I can address them all with one simple statement. Mu Ramen is one of the best ramen spots in New York City. We'd actually go as far as to say we like it almost as much as we like Ippudo, and we f*cking love Ippudo. In fact, the Tonkotsu Ramen on Mu's menu was modeled after Ippudo's famous Akamaru Modern, and it does a pretty damn good job of emulating that bowl of all bowls. But you shouldn't come here just for that. If you want a bowl of Akamaru Modern, you know where to get one. You should come to Mu Ramen for everything else, from the excellent vibe in the 22 seat room, to friendly staff, to the incredibly creative and delicious dishes they call ""Treats.""
The soup is also excellent, and it is actually different than the other stuff out there right now. Mu Ramen takes the fat out of their broth after it cools down and rises to the top. Most other Japanese ramen spots do not. The end result is a much cleaner taste that's still rich and flavorful, and it might not make you want to die so much after eating it. The ramen here is also lighter on the salt, leaving the high quality ingredients to stand up on their own.
We appreciate that concern for our health, but what we appreciate most about Mu Ramen is just that it's fun and different. The hype surrounding the place might have you believe otherwise, but this is really just a neighborhood restaurant that happens to be so good it's worth traveling for. The question then becomes, when is the best time to go in hopes of landing a seat?
Good question."

Whatever that man did on his free time in an adult movie theater one lonely night in 1991 is none of my business. He'll always be the guy who made the world's greatest breakfast machine to me.
The reality is that regardless of how you feel about Pee Wee and/or his big adventure, there's one thing that is universally true - eating like a kid is awesome. And that's what Queen's Comfort is tapping into. This Astoria restaurant is hugely popular, thanks to a fail proof formula that's one part nostalgia and two parts putting cereal on top of food. There are about 40 items on the menu here, and at least five of them include some sort of cornflake or Capt'N Crunch application. It's a lot of fun, assuming that you find campy decor and greasy food appealing.
When it comes to the food, we find that Queens Comfort is all about things that taste good but will definitely give you a stomach ache later. There's really just no way to eat basket full of deep fried, sriracha-filled mac and cheese balls without paying some sort of price for it. That's the case with the entire menu - almost everything is one step too far in the direction of ridiculous, and that's what makes it entertaining. It's just not something you can or should do very often.
Then again, it seems that a lot of people eat at Queens Comfort quite often, especially for brunch. Expect crowds, and expect to need an ATM as credit cards are not accepted. You'll also need to bring some booze - QC is BYOB.
Maybe bring your own comically large fork and knife too."

",2.0,Pizza,Houdini Kitchen Laboratory,7.9,"It's a shame that more restaurants don't have excellent names. People love to say, ""Hey, that'd be a great name for a band!"" but rarely, ""Hey, that'd be a great name for a restaurant."" As a result, most new restaurants end up being called something like ""The [Insert A Random Non-English Noun]"" or ""[Insert A Random Workshop Tool] & [Insert A Random Obscure Animal].""
So props to Houdini Kitchen Laboratory for having one of the best names in the restaurant business.
Before we made it there, we'd heard Houdini described as the new Roberta's and as the current ""spirit animal"" of Ridgewood. Fair enough. A few years ago, Roberta's, located where Williamsburg spills into Bushwick, became the poster child of Bushwick's growing restaurant scene. And Houdini, located where Bushwick spills into Ridgewood and crosses the border from Brooklyn to Queens (can we not call it Quooklyn, please?), holds a similar role as reigning pizza place hangout of the neighborhood.
But a sweet name and some parallels to a beloved spot with two hour waits does not a great restaurant make. Fortunately, Houdini has a lot more going for it. First and foremost, Houdini has great pizza - from a simple pie featuring some of the creamiest mozzarella we've ever witnessed to others topped with impressively fresh vegetables and quality cured meats. The space, which you enter through an almost-hidden opening on a nearly silent street, is also a highlight. High ceilings. Long, spaced-out tables. An old factory vibe. And, in warmer months, an Outdoor/Patio Situation to be reckoned with. Add that to big $12 pizzas and a few bottles of wine under $30, and it's easy to forget you're in New York. Getting there may mean a few extra stops on the L train, and note: it's cash only, but, at least for now, you certainly won't be quoted an hour once you get there.
Ultimately, despite the Houdini reference, nothing going on here is really magic: it's just very good pizza in a very good space."

",1.0,Burgers,Shake Shack,8.7,"I once saw a man at Shake Shack, dressed in a suit and setting a formal table. On the small metal table he placed a white tablecloth, fine silverware, a candle, and some flowers. For a moment, I was overcome with joy at the beautiful event that was about to unfold before me...this man was about to propose to a burger.
Unfortunately, a woman soon arrived and the man instead professed his undying love for her. Nonetheless, I was inspired, and had learned something important. I now realized that I could live a fulfilled and happy life devoted to a single hamburger - The Shack Burger.
There are two lessons to be learned from this story. First, Shake Shack is the burger by which all other New York City burgers are to be measured. This is hamburger perfection, and the epic lines are the only thing preventing weekly Infatuation visits. Second, there is a huge badass somewhere out there that proposed to his girlfriend over a burger and fries. Well done sir."

",3.0,Italian,ápizz,5.5,"It’s a bummer when you return to a restaurant you once had strong feelings for only to realize it kind of sucks now. That’s what happened on our most recent visit to an old Infatuation favorite, ápizz. What used to be one of Manhattan’s ultimate hidden gems and best date night restaurants has turned into a shell of its former self. Over the course of the past decade, absolutely nothing has changed at ápizz. The menu is exactly the same as it was when we first started eating here in 2007, which would be fine if the food was still great, but that’s sadly not the case. The skate dish is still the best thing on the menu, and there are a couple good pastas, but overall, the food isn’t exciting anymore.
Secretly tucked away on Eldridge Street amongst nothing but residential buildings, you have to know ápizz was there to find it, and the cozy room you find inside has always been the holy grail of the restaurant. “An X-factor exists within the walls of ápizz that can take an average night and turn it into the start of something memorable, perhaps even legendary.” That’s a quote from my original review (with 8.3 rating) from 2009. Well, that room hasn’t been updated at all, and it now feels worn and outdated. One thing that has changed? The amount of people eating here. What used to be a tough table is now an empty, desolate place.
Great restaurants evolve over time, continually reinventing themselves or consistently putting out incredible food. That’s the only way to stay in the game of a constantly changing, incredibly competitive landscape. ápizz hasn’t done that. The 2015 version of apizz feels exhaustively tired.
ápizz had a great run. They went hard for over a decade and will always hold a special place in our stomachs. Breaking up with someone you once loved is never easy, but sometimes, it’s what needs to be done. Sorry ápizz, it pains us to do this, but it’s time for us to move on."

We get that there will always be a need for a place where old business dudes can celebrate their latest Ponzi scheme/jet ski purchase, but we’ve never been the type to drop big money and big calories on buttered meat and scalloped potatoes.
There are definitely some restaurants we visit when such an occasion is called for (like that time we bought a used jet ski) - St. Anselm, Minetta Tavern, and Strip House among them. Bowery Meat Company now belongs on that list.
Bowery Meat Company is the new steak house from Josh Capon and the Lure/Burger & Barrel Team, and after having now eaten here, we can share this groundbreaking scientific discovery: We officially have something in common with Justin Bieber, Michael Strahan, and a Real Housewife. No, not that we are all about to “drop a single,” and not that we’ve all taken a selfie with Chef Capon. We all share the experience of enjoying a steak and juicy ass piece of duck lasagna and about seven bottles of red wine at Bowery Meat Company. And we enjoyed every second of it.
So, yeah, Bowery Meat Company attracts its share of celebrities. But we love that it’s not alienating for regular folk like us. That’s in part because the wait staff is welcoming and the dining room feels more like your rich but hilariously anti-establishment (read: drunk) uncle’s dining room than the conference room-meets-library vibe of most steak restaurants. It’s also not a Meatpacking District club scene, which helps. But the food also contributes to the comfort. From starter to dessert, this restaurant is outrageously good while still feeling approachable.
Will we eat here weekly? Not until we can figure out an appropriate Ponzi scheme/heart donor to make that possible. But will we seize every opportunity to eat duck lasagna with a side of a potential T. Swift sighting? You better believe it."

Sure, our restaurants serve up some of the best seafood in the world, but New York City is far from a fishing village and doesn't exactly have much in terms of fish markets you'd actually want to hang out inside of for more than five minutes. All of our best seafood restaurants are urban versions of the roadside clam shack or elevated oyster bar, so it hasn't been until right now, at this moment, that we've really started living the life aquatic properly. Greenpoint Fish and Lobster, it's great to meet you.
Greenpoint is where all the dope sh*t happens these days, so it shouldn't come as surprise that it's home to NYC's most legit new fish market and restaurant. You walk in, and it's raw fish on ice for days. Like a really really really small version of Pike's Place in Seattle. Everything they sell is sustainable, which means you can feel good about eating it. We don't live in Greenpoint, so the fish market element, while cool, isn't why we're hanging such a high number on this spot. It's the dine-in menu that's got us all hot and buttered up.
If you like seafood, then G'Point Fish and Lobster will be your new favorite restaurant. We were pretty blown away by how awesome all the food was, from the oyster prep, to the mussels, fish stew, solid fish tacos, and the best damn lobster roll we've had in NYC not named Luke's. It's all housed in a small tile-filled room packed with high tops and bar seats, with great vibes and slick overall branding. It's the kind of place we'd frequent all the time if we lived nearby, and would even suggest traveling for. After all, Greenpoint is a lot closer than the Atlantic Ocean."

Enter Wogies, the notorious Eagles bar that's a lot more tolerable off season. We we get that unhealthy itch to go to the dark side, we take care of that situation at Wogies.
The inside of this sports den looks no different from the one you probably frequent back in your hometown, where jersey's and sweatpants are acceptable attire, and the check is served with wet naps. There's a nice big bar, plenty of seating, and flat screens everywhere. Points earned for good food, but points deducted for the large presence of loud, obnoxious Philly fans, the most annoying breed of sports fan that exists. If you've ever been in the West Village during an Eagles game, you've definitely heard the rambunctious throwdown that is Wogies at game time.

(New York City kids grow up fast and love having birthday parties on the Lower East Side.) But your dad’s 60th? Probably not. This is party time. Also: it’s reasonably priced, nicely decorated, takes reservations for groups of four or more, and has a menu that’s ideal for sharing.
The space feels a bit like if Miss Lily’s were more spacious and also served tacos. It’s split in two levels - upstairs is a mix of long picnic tables and
booths, while downstairs is darker, with a long bar and space for your group of 12 to make all the noise you want. There are, of course, a whole bunch of Mexican places on the Lower East Side accommodating to groups, but we found this one to be particularly fun and fresh right now - a scene of sorts but without too much pretension, and a party time vibe without being total mayhem.
The food? Pretty good, especially once your friend Mezcal arrives. (Her parents were a very specific kind of hippie.) There’s a mix of small starters like empanadas and ceviches, followed by tacos and skewers, and finished off by large format plates to share. Nothing’s too big, so you probably want all of these things on your table. Some dishes have subtly Asian or otherwise non-
Mexican influences, but calling it fusion would be a stretch.
Calling it enjoyable and fun, however, would not. Happy Birthday."

",3.0,Mexican,Cosme,8.7,"Anticipation and expectation. Two things that when left unchecked can ruin everything. This is true for many aspects of life, whether you’re prayin’ on a Powerball ticket, skipping medical school to “pursue your music,” or somehow still rooting for New York sports teams. It’s also very true for restaurants.
Cosme is about as highly anticipated as a restaurant gets in this town, with the speculation over when famed Mexico chef Enrique Olvera would open beginning more than a full year before they served a single plate. We were certainly excited to try it for many months before it became a real thing, but not necessarily because of the chef’s previous successes. We just happen to love Mexican food of all shapes, sizes, and culinary interpretations. Except, of course, Dos Caminos.
So what is Cosme, other than a seriously hyped restaurant? Well, let’s start with what it’s not. This isn’t some high end, “Parque De Eleven Madison” take on Mexican food. We were actually surprised at how simple the dishes are, even more so than a place like Empellon Cocina, but with a similarly inventive approach. The flavors are all familiar - cilantro, jalapeno, lime, corn - but some of the menu items are unmistakably New York City, and by that we mean burrata instead of burritos. The room is huge, but it’s also dark and sexy, making it as Perfect For a date as it is for a night of drinking tequila. But it’s definitely not a place for Sarah’s 24th birthday. And don’t expect anyone to bring you chips and salsa.
Which brings us back to expectations. Those can get you in trouble at Cosme. We really, really like this restaurant. But part of that is because we didn't expect to. We never really put this place up on a pedestal before our visits like some other people did, and we were surprised at how approachable it is - even though it sort of looks like the Death Star inside. It’s also important that you’re not someone who just expects Mexican food to be cheap, because Cosme most definitely isn’t. But we definitely think it’s worth your money, especially if you’re someone who can get down on a bunch of uni on top of a tostada.
We expect you are."

",3.0,American,Community Food & Juice,7.6,"Michelle and Malia Obama had lunch at Community Food & Juice recently, and that was big news to certain people, most of which seemed to be of the opinion that this restaurant across from Columbia University is going to ""totally blow up now."" Those people have clearly never been to Community Food & Juice on a Saturday around noon. The lines for brunch at this place are already so long that they should probably put a security detail at the host stand, regardless of whether presidential offspring is in the house. Tell this devoted clientele that there's an hour between them and gluten free biscuits, and things can get tense.
As we mentioned in our guide to Where To Eat Around Columbia University, one might think from the crowds that Community Food & Juice is the only viable brunch spot anywhere near campus. It isn't, though it is definitely one of the better places to eat around here. Brought to you by the husband and wife proprietors of Clinton Street Baking Co., this restaurant does morning food very well, and they do it with a healthy slant that make it a far better option than whatever diner you were considering eating in as an alternative. Our only problem with it comes down to consistency, which brings us to our recommendation.
If you want to have a really good meal at Community, avoid it during prime time all together. That means don't go for brunch, and yes we know that means you can't have the eggs benedict that you like so much. But there are better things to eat on this menu anyway, and they are all available during weekday breakfast, along with a $12 blueberry pancake special that is 100% worth that amount of money. Lunch is also a good time to hit it, especially if you've got some time to linger, and we like Community for dinner too.
Ultimately, this restaurant's problem is that it just isn't at it's best when it's operating at full tilt. The food suffers from the pressure on the kitchen to keep up, as does the service, both of which are otherwise excellent. If you must go for brunch, go at it alone. You can generally walk right in and sit at the bar and eat your food in peace, or maybe chat up some Columbia dad who is in town visiting his kid. Just don't be surprised if he has a security detail of his own."

",2.0,Sandwiches,Black Seed Bagels,8.2,"Are these really the best bagels in New York City? Why in the world would one even want to ""beet cure"" an otherwise perfectly good piece of salmon? Would Black Seed Bagels even exist if Instagram did not? What else is Canada trying to steal from us?
These are the questions that we imagine being asked if someone were to convene a summit of New York's most respected bagel experts. Since no such summit has been proposed (and since everyone in this town is apparently an expert), we'll take a stab at the answers: no such thing, because it tastes good, probably not, and freedom.
Now that that's been settled, let's have a simple conversation about Black Seed Bagels. Opened by Noah Bernamoff of Mile End and Matt Kliegman of The Smile in the summer of 2014, Black Seed makes bagels in the much-celebrated ""Montreal style,"" meaning that they're poached in honey water and seeded before being baked at high temperature on premises. They're smaller than the behemoths that you probably get from your neighborhood delivery spot, they're a little bit crispy, and they have a bit of sweetness to them. They've been called ""perfect,"" ""ambitious,"" and ""the best"" by many people who describe food for a living. We're not ready to go that far, but we can confirm for the few among you who haven't had one that they are excellent.
The thing that tends to get people so riled up about Black Seed is all that talk about it being New York's best bagel. We'd argue that there's just no way for any bagel shop to hold that title, simply because there are too many great bagels in NYC. We'd also argue that Black Seed Bagels are actually more about what's inside the bagels, rather than the bagels themselves, much in the vein of Russ & Daughters. High quality ingredients and well-executed creativity is what makes these sandwiches great, and sandwiches are really what this place is all about.
Let's also take a minute and be thankful for the fact that if these aren't New York City's best bagels, how lucky are we to live in a place where ""not the best"" is this f*cking good? Instead of arguing about it, let's agree to hold onto that idea for a while - at least until we can get that summit convened."

She wears linens and gray things that aren’t designer name but are made of nice materials and mostly ignores trends while still having both quirks and some certain sense of classic cool.
Via Carota is kind of like the New York restaurant version of that.
In a scene filled with loud, ball-so-hard restaurants like Dirty French and Carbone and even Upland, Via Carota is a pretty quiet newcomer. They haven’t even posted their menu online! How blasé.
That’s not to say the place is somehow super quiet or under the radar. After all, it’s from the people behind the perpetually packed Buvette, has some serious real estate on a busy West Village street, and thanks to a no-reservation policy, you can expect there will typically be a wait. Fortunately, there’s a nice bar to wait at with a bitter Italian cocktail.
We appreciate that Via Carota doesn’t pander - you won’t find sea urchin in any of the pastas. Kind of a relief, to be honest. But the food? It didn’t quite blow us away. Your meal will probably consist of a few shared small-to-medium sized plates, and in our experience, they’re a somewhat mixed bag. The pastas are solid, and so are some of the seafood dishes and vegetables, but in the West Village, where cute Italian restaurants are on pretty much every block, they don’t really stand out. Via Carota’s signature dish is the “svizzerina,” or chopped steak, which is, depending on how you look at it, a bunless burger or a steak tartare that ended up in the frying pan. Like the restaurant, it’s understated and a little different, but a few steps shy of being really excellent."

That's one of the fun things about a place like Veselka that's been around for 60 years and which is open 24 hours a day.
Veselka holds a place in a lot of people's hearts, and I think that's because they serve comfort food like your grandmother used to make, especially if you used to go to grandmother's house after a night at Continental bar.
Like many of you, we are Team Veselka. Veselka has managed to keep it going for 60 years, as many of the city's classic diners and other nearby Eastern European restaurants, have closed down, and they deserve some serious cred for that. They also serve a pleasing combination of greasy spoon staples, including a beloved burger, and Ukrainian specialties like borscht and pierogies, which are a big part of what's kept everyone coming back.

",3.0,American,Little Park,8.1,"I almost died on a flight from London to New York the other day. Well, not really. But I was pretty sure that I was going to die, thanks to a combination of prolonged moderate turbulence over the Atlantic and an ill-timed Ambien. (It turns out that if you take one of those things and don’t actually fall asleep, you become some sort of hyper-emotional zombie capable of seeing the future.)
As my short future left on this earth flashed before me, I thought about the things that I would miss about life on the ground in New York City. Obviously eating food was near the top of that list, right after my family and friends, House of Cards, and sneezing. That then led me to spend some time appreciating the fact that I’ve lived in New York City for over a decade and have had the good fortune of eating damn near everything that this city has to offer. There’s nothing like 10 days in Europe and a near-death experience to remind you that NYC is the best food city on the planet.
Take, for example, Little Park. Andrew Carmellini opened this restaurant in the Smyth Hotel last year. It’s an excellent little spot with a farm-focused menu, inventive dishes that you won’t find anywhere else, and the magical ability to make vegetables taste amazing. The prices are even surprisingly reasonable. And yet it’s probably Carmellini’s third best restaurant in town. It’s not even his best restaurant in this neighborhood.
Put Little Park anywhere else - London, Paris, LA, you name it - and it would be at or near the top of that city’s dining scene. But here, it’s just another great restaurant amongst a sea of other great restaurants - a great place for dinner with the girls or the next downtown Date Night you’re planning. Does it belong on your bucket list? That probably depends on how badly you want to eat beetroot tartare before it’s all said and done. At the very least, get it on your Hit List. And probably stay off the Ambien."

From the get-go its been abundantly clear: this is a restaurant that's going to be here for the long haul. Along with Red Rooster and The Cecil, it's one of the key players in the new Harlem restaurant scene.
A Spanish/Italian hybrid, and favorite of Friday Fives alum Lin-Manual Miranda, Vinatería has got it going on across the board. It's a sleek, stylish room filled with good vibes, and there's a serious Outdoor/Patio Situation  out front to be taken advantage of during the warmer months. The food is all really solid. We're big into the lamb ribs and calamari, and they do one of the best grilled whole branzinos in town. On top of that, the beverage program is impressive, they take their cocktails seriously, and curate a small but potent wine and beer list. Also, Vinatería crushes brunch. Their Huevos Rancheros are waiting to cure your next hangover, and it's also the only time they serve their burgers.
When you go, you'll most definitely meet Gabriella, who runs the place (her husband, Gustavo, is the chef). Gabriella will make her presence felt, in a good way, at your table. She'll be checking to make sure everything is OK, that you like the food, and asking about your personal life. Sometimes you'll even get Yvette, the owner, perched at your table, chatting you up and making you feel welcome. Yvette is a Harlem lifer whose dream was to open up her own neighborhood restaurant someday. Dream realized. It's the hospitable ownership and overall good intentions that allow Vinatería to get away with having otherwise fluky service, as many of the servers don't really have a full grasp of the menu, or much experience working in restaurants we've found.
Regardless, Vinatería is one of those restaurants we've found ourselves wanting to come back to, wanting to support, and wanting to tell people about. Harlem is most definitely going through some changes right now, and if Vinatería is any indication, they're changes for the best."

Mexico 2000 is a great place to go whenever you're looking for tacos near the J train in Williamsburg. But it's also the perfect place to test out your current relationship.

Can he or she ""hang."" Some initial hesitation is fine - maybe even normal - but anything resembling an ""ew"" or a ""gross"" is a red flag.

They all love Upland. And we do, too. So much so that today it receives one of the highest ratings on all of The Infatuation. Love is a beautiful thing.
There are a lot of factors that make Upland a special restaurant. The food, handled by former Il Buco Alimentari chef Justin Similie, is California-inspired, vegetable-driven, and absolutely incredible. The menu has so many superstar dishes on it that we’ve pretty much stopped giving people a list of things to order when they ask us what they should eat. The restaurant itself, designed by well-known firm Roman and Williams, is not only beautiful, but it’s also functional. There’s a lively bar area that’s Perfect For a quick drink and some food, and the tables in the dining room behind it are comfortable, spacious, and just quiet enough that you can actually carry on a conversation. The whole thing is done up in jade and copper, and is the kind of environment that makes you think to yourself, “Opulence, I has it.” But it’s also casual enough that you won’t feel like you have to hit Drybar before dinner, or whatever else you ladies do to your head these days before a big night out. The service is friendly and professional, the cocktails are good, and the wine list is extensive and loaded with great bottles in the $50 range. So yeah, they got pretty much everything right.Then again, all of those qualities that I just rattled off are true of a lot of other restaurants that we love in New York City. And yet none of those have a rating north of 9.0. Why? Because it’s the ability to be so universally appealing that makes Upland unique. This isn’t a cool restaurant (even though it’s pretty cool), it isn’t a restaurant industry hang (even though you’ll see lots of those types eating here), and it’s not a stuffy place in the lobby of a hotel (even though that’s where most of our new restaurants are these days). It’s just a really great restaurant, with really great food, that you can be confident will please pretty much anyone you’re planning to have dinner with. Even that guy from the office who really loves Hillstone. You guys should spend some more time together anyway."

",3.0,Japanese,Okonomi / Yuji Ramen,8.5,"One restaurant. Two names. During the day, this tiny 12-seat house of chopstick heaven is home to Okonomi, in which they serve a traditional Japanese set meal called “Ichiju Sansai.” At night, the space gets taken over by Yuji Ramen, one of the best, most unique noodle joints that exists in this fine city filled with ramen. Before we get into why you need to eat here immediately and explain the best plan of attack, let’s get into some of the backstory, because that part is important.
Chef Yuji Haraguchi had never worked in a professional kitchen before he was hired as a prep cook at Roberta’s a few years back by Tara Norvell, his eventual business partner. Yuji wound up cooking ramen for staff meal a lot, and every time he did it, people were blown away. Turns out, Yuji WAS A FREAK IN THE KITCHEN. Yuji and Tara decided to pop up with his unique brothless ramen, otherwise known as mazemen, at Smorgasburg on the regular. Yuji became the toast of Smorg, which then led to a permanent pop-up space on the second-floor food court of the Whole Foods on Bowery. Yuji Ramen served Yuji's brothless ramen creations all day, and then at night, he offered a one-of-a kind, 16-seat, impossible to get into tasting menu. We went. It was silly. The hype was full throttle, and it was all warranted.
When you have sufficiently generated this kind of buzz and then open your first ever brick-and-mortar location, which is what Okonomi is, you’d think it’d be a food media frenzy, right? Well, that hasn’t exactly been the case. It’s been kind of quiet, which is surprising to us. We’re here today to make sure Okonomi/Yuji Ramen gets on your hit list immediately, because it’s one of the most exciting restaurants in NYC.
For breakfast and lunch at Okonomi, they take you straight to Tokyo, serving the supremely delicious, traditional “Ichiju Sansai” meal, which consists of a rice bowl, a miso soup, a piece of cooked fish, and three small sides. It’s light, it’s healthy, and it’s very affordable, coming in at $12 per person. After lunch, they proceed to throw all the leftover fish and excess bones into big pots to start cooking that night’s ramen broth. Yuji Ramen is open Sunday-Thursday evenings, while on Friday and Saturday nights, they do a new version of the tasting menu for which they became famous - to get a seat, you need to book a month out. Considering there are only 12 seats, you will likely have to wait regardless of when you come, but they move quickly, and The Blind Barber is right next door, so you can go and get a coffee during the day, or a beer at night, until your table is ready.
Come for lunch, come back for dinner, and if you want to get real crazy, do the weekend tasting menu. Ramen, most certainly, is not dead."

",4.0,Sushi,Sushi Nakazawa,8.7,"Eating sushi in New York is a perfect reflection of the New York experience itself. How much will you enjoy it? How much money do you have?
If your answer lies anywhere between “a lot” and “ask my parents,” you probably like the sushi offerings in this town quite a bit. You also probably REALLY love New York. Or at least the version of it that you call home, which includes such luxuries as “a bedroom” and a “savings account.”
We certainly aren’t quite at that level, or at least we won’t be until we sell The Infatuation to Rupert Murdoch and his henchmen. And so we have varying opinions on the New York sushi experience, largely dependent on who is picking up the bill. Got a corporate card? Let’s talk business over toro. Want to split the bill? Spider rolls and edamame it is.
Sushi Nakazawa might be the most “New York” sushi restaurant in town. Clearly a high end Japanese experience isn’t unique to this city, but one run by a semi-famous sushi chef from a hit documentary probably is. Especially when you consider that this place looks less like a Japanese dining establishment and more like someone put a sushi counter inside of an Hermès store.
Every bite of sushi you will eat at Nakazawa will be pretty fcking awesome. And when you do the math, it will also be really fcking expensive. The standard 20 piece omakase here is $150 per person at the sushi bar, so... yeah, you’re dropping some dime. The question then always becomes - is it worth it? That answer is sort of tough. How recently did you watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi?
We know people who love this restaurant, and we know other people who don’t. And as much as it does come down to how much money you feel comfortable parting with for a meal, it also comes down to how much the true art of sushi means to you. This is not the Sushi of Gari-style presentation, where sautéed tomato and tofu sauce are thrown around wildly. This is a “quest for sushi perfection” type of meal, and that means you might find some sea salt atop your fish, or maybe some soy sauce or the occasional shiso leaf. But that’s pretty much it. All in all, both the experience and the food are pretty damn incredible, and certainly worth your time. Whether or not it’s worth your money is not something for us to decide. Ask your business manager?"

",4.0,American,ABC Kitchen,7.4,"When was the last time you were at ABC Kitchen? If it’s been a while, you might find yourself wondering, “What’s different?” on your next visit, as you eat crab toast amongst a room full of people who also love Pinterest.
After nearly five years in business, not much on the surface has changed at this well-regarded restaurant. It’s still rustic, it’s still pretty, and it’s still crowded. But it’s also definitely not the same as it used to be - specifically when it comes to the food. All of the most popular ABC Kitchen items are still featured on the menu, as are the expected rotation of highly seasonal vegetable dishes. But the quality has deteriorated since chef Dan Kluger left. And that’s why we’re here with an updated review.
Before we go too far down the rabbit hole, let’s be clear that ABC Kitchen is still a good restaurant. If you’re looking for a Date Night destination or place to take someone who is good at business in the Union Square area, this is a decent option. The staff is nice, and the atmosphere is tough to beat. But it simply isn’t among the best of the best in this city anymore. And I think I have an explanation as to why.
ABC Kitchen is a Jean-Georges restaurant. His name is listed first at the bottom of the menu, with the title of “Chef/Proprietor.” But we all know that he’s not anywhere near this kitchen most of the time. As a matter of fact, I saw the dude in Miami not all that long ago, roaming the floor at one of his new hotel cafes. There’s nothing wrong with that - most of us who eat out frequently are not naive to the fact that the chef whose name is on the press release is rarely the one doing the actual cooking. And Jean-Georges is no rookie when it comes to running several establishments at once. But the first thing I noticed during my recent ABC Kitchen meals was that my dinner seemed automated. Like a robot had been set to “farm-to-table” mode with the purpose of making carrot avocado salad at scale, to be serviced from one central location to all JG restaurants that feature it on the menu.
To some extent, that’s what’s happening. Many of the ABC Kitchen dishes are now featured on other menus around the country, like Inn at Pound Ridge, and his places in Miami. They’re not as good there, either. Ultimately, I just don’t think high-end, high concept food like this is scalable, and I think ABC Kitchen is a great example of that. Out goes Dan Kluger, and out goes the quality. And it feels like the new executive chef they brought in has simply been handed the playbook - hired to replicate what was already working. The result is food that lacks a personal touch.
Here’s an idea. Instead of making kale salad and crab toast in large quantities, how about we set that robot to “In-N-Out” and start replicating those around the East Coast. That’s scalability I can get behind."

",1.0,American,Egg Shop,7.6,"This review has been a long time coming. Not because we couldn’t decide how we felt about Egg Shop. But because we couldn’t get a table.
We had a feeling this might be the case when we walked down Elizabeth Street a few months ago around noon on a Saturday, and passed by a girl we hadn’t seen since sorority rush anxiously searching for Egg Shop. “Wait, where is Egg Shop?” An apathetic boyfriend shrugged.
A block down, we were quoted a wait: 90 minutes. We tried again a week later, just before noon on a Sunday. An hour wait.
Egg Shop has all the elements of a popular weekend brunch venue: a Nolita location, a brightly-appointed space, and a menu largely centered around oozing yolks, avocado, bacon, and bloody marys. It also happens to be quite small, which contributes to the long lines.
Anyway, spoiler alert: we finally went to Egg Shop (on a dreary Monday right before Christmas) and very much liked it. The eggs are cooked just right, but it’s actually more about the variety of sandwiches and bowls they’re mixed into. And there’s one for pretty much everyone: whether you want your egg in a pulled pork sandwich called “The Beast” or a quinoa bowl called “The Spandex.”
We don’t know how long you’re willing to wait in line for brunch, but we do know that Egg Shop is actually open until 1am on weekends.

",2.0,Burgers,Emily,9.1,"Pizza is an incredibly subjective cuisine. Everyone has their favorite pie, slice, and old school Brooklyn spot firmly entrenched deep inside their psyche, and it takes a lot to mess with that hierarchy. Emily has succeeded in doing just that for us. After a couple trips to Clinton Hill, our pizza power rankings have forever changed.
We love everything about Emily. It’s the kind of restaurant you walk into and immediately know you’re in a place where good things happen. It’s a small space with tons of character. Everyone who works here is lovely, from the bartender, to the servers, to the owner, Emily, who you’ll most certainly meet. She runs the show, while her husband, Matt, cooks. The music is on point, too - Juan MacLean into Cut Copy into War On Drugs? Yes, please. And then there’s the glorious, dreamy, crispy, crunchy, heavenly thin-crusted, lightly burnt, honey-kissed yeasty goodness otherwise known as Emily’s pizza.
Emily is not a classic New York pie, nor a Neapolitan. The thin crust pies are cooked in a wood-fired oven, which produces a crisped bottom underneath a thin layer of hot dough. Emily immediately enters the same category of fellow new classics like Roberta’s and Paulie Gee’s, and to be honest, is our personal favorite among the three. The pies here may be a little pricey, and not traditional at all, but holy pepperoni are they good. Of all the “new” pizzas we’ve eaten in New York, The Colony at Emily is our absolute favorite. This spicy, sweet number is a red sauce pie with homemade mozzarella, pepperoni, pickled chilis, and honey. The Emily is another mind-blower, and quite possibly the sweetest pie you’ll ever sink your teeth into. And what does Emily have the other aforementioned spots don’t? The most ridiculous burger you’ll probably eat all year AND a duck ragu pasta that’ll blow your mind. Emily: not just pizza. Oh, it’s so much more.
We understand you probably have plenty of important pizza in your life already and may not want to entertain the idea of new pizza. However, you need to trust us on this one. That Emily, damn is she fine."

",2.0,Japanese,Cocoron,8.7,"Ramen is a little bit like Beyoncé.
When you mention ramen, people tend to freak out. Ramen makes people feel alive! Ramen gives people purpose. Ramen makes people yell “OMG” and use prayer hands emojis. And rightfully so. Ramen, like Beyoncé, is great. But it can also be a lot to take in. Ramen hotspots like Ippudo are like Beyoncé concerts: they’re a challenge to get into, and they’re a little overwhelming. (In the case of ramen, you also often leave feeling really full.)
So think of soba as the Solange of the Japanese noodle world. Soba doesn’t incite quite the mania that ramen does, but the noodles are also excellent. They’re just a little more underground. More indie. Soba noodles - which are made of buckwheat - have a little less glitz, but they can still pack a punch. Even in an elevator. Andddd... moving on.
When it comes to soba, Cocoron is our number one spot. There are other places to eat some nice soba, but most of them - like Soba Koh in the East Village - feel like being in a library. Cocoron, on the other hand, is a ton of fun. The place is bright and lively, and the menu is covered in manga characters extolling the health benefits of soba.The food also rules. We’re particular fans of the “dipping” soba, where you get a plate of lukewarm soba and a little hotpot of soup/sauce that you dip the soba in. When you’ve finished your noodles but have some hotpot liquids left over, a waiter will bring out some of the enriched hot water that the soba was originally cooked in, and you get to dump that in the dipping sauce to make a soup. The process is called “soba yu,” and it’s like multiple meals in one. It’s fun, interactive, and delicious.
For traditionalists, there’s also cold soba served with various mix-ins and a selection of noodle soups. And while soba may be the main attraction, the tofu appetizer and some of the desserts are destination-worthy as well.
As Solange would say, “Some things never seem to f*cking work.” Cocoron pretty much always works though."

",3.0,Pasta,Frank,7.4,"Frank is a classic East Village establishment. This place has been serving fresh, simple Italian food to people on 2nd Avenue since 1998, and anyone who pays attention to such a thing will tell you that this is one of the ""essential"" restaurants of the neighborhood.
We're not here today to argue any of that. Nor are we here to tell you that the food at Frank isn't just as good now as it was when we first reviewed it in 2009. It is.
What we are here to say is that we officially can't deal with how uncomfortable a restaurant this is to eat in. Maybe it's because we're getting old, or maybe it's because we're just not cool enough to pretend we like things we really don't anymore. Or, maybe I just don't want to eat dinner with some stranger's hot breath on my neck and a leg that's completely numb from having to fold it into a trapezoid to fit it under the tiny table in front of me. The point is, primetime meal hours at Frank are now off limits. They just pack this place with way too many bodies, and too many other restaurants in the East Village have a good rigatoni bolognese.
All of that said, there are still a few situations in which we can emphatically recommend a visit to Frank, and they all have to do with how much of a job you have. If you enjoy the kind of work freedom to hit this place in the middle of the afternoon for some pasta and a glass of wine, you absolutely should, and congratulations on that. The patio out front is also a solid move on a quiet sunny weekday. And if you're really into Italian wine, Frank has one of the best lists around. Just make sure to bring some cash - some for the Barolo and some to bribe the guy next to you for a little room to move your elbows around. You're gonna need it."

",1.0,Pizza,Arcade Bakery,7.9,"Here's what Arcade Bakery is not: the hottest new underground restaurant with a monthlong waiting list. It's in the lobby of an office building, and seating, amazingly, is even plentiful. Another thing it's not: some swanky new date spot, unless your version of a date is croissants and pizza before 4 pm on a weekday.
So what is Arcade Bakery? The most important thing you need to know is it's the new home to New York's best croissant. This is some small-village-in-France level buttery baking, and we're pretty confident in saying that there's no longer much of a contest: Arcade Bakery has taken the croissant crown.
Arcade Bakery is located in the ground floor of an office building at 220 Church Street, so you're unlikely to stumble in randomly, which is why we'd like to bring it to your attention. In addition to croissants, Arcade also serves some incredible bread and babka, as well as sandwiches and pizza at lunchtime. The goods are both baked and served by Roger Gural, who used to be the head baker at Thomas Keller's famous Bouchon Bakery, and also has incredible bakeries like Bouley and Almondine in Dumbo (unsurprisingly, also famous for its croissants) on his resume. He's basically the valedictorian of baking, but without any pomposity or tendency to curb to the pressures of cronut-type madness. Arcade sticks to the classics, and totally kills it doing so.
The hours - 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays only - are tricky unless you work in the area (new World Trade Center imports, you're just in walking range), but it's worth going a little out of the way for a midday excursion for a fresh pizza, or a croissant for lunch. Go forth and carbohydrate."

",3.0,American,Tuome,8.2,"There are approximately 800 restaurants in New York that are “Asian influenced.” There are probably another 400 that serve some take on pork belly, and let’s say there are 200 serving some newfangled “fancy” take on deviled eggs. And at least a dozen are run by chefs who trained at places like Eleven Madison Park.
Tuome is all of these things, but it’s also pretty different. And more importantly, it’s really, really good.
Tuome is located in a cozy little space on 5th Street near Avenue B, and it’s one of the most enjoyable new places we’ve been recently. The food and space both have that rare ability to feel casual and comfortable, but still finished. Tuome isn’t a half-finished assignment cobbled together during a Red Bull-fueled all-nighter. This place did the homework all semester and even got one of those plastic folders to put the term paper in.
A number of menu items - pork belly, octopus, scallops, skate, mushrooms - are not uncommon, but their preparations all are, in great ways. Octopus comes in a cool spiral with XO sauce, the scallops have a somehow not ridiculously rich foie gras sauce, and mushrooms feature an exploding egg yolk. The star of the show, at least in that it was on nearly every table, is the “Pig Out” for two, which consists of little squares of crispy pork belly with sides of spicy sesame noodles.
The service is solid and friendly, which helps, considering the crowd here was slightly older than average for the East Village. We’ve seen quite a few dates on our visits, but we’d come with a group of four or more if you can so that you can order the large format “Pig Out” while still getting to try the rest of the menu.

",4.0,Wine Bar,Terra,6.6,"What's the difference between a wine bar and a restaurant with wine? These are the things I often think about in solitude.
Normally, the answer would be that one has food and one does not, but these days the lines are blurry. Terroir is a wine bar, but they also have an excellent menu of things to eat while you drink. I think Corkbuzz is a wine bar, but the newest location has inexplicably been at the top of the Eater Heatmap for the last three months, so it must be a restaurant. I know Bar Veloce is a wine bar because I've only been there with a visitor from out of town, a date, or a group of girls who are overdressed for a Wednesday night. And let's be honest, those are the scenarios in which you most typically find yourself at a wine bar.
As for Terra, I could go either way. Part of me thinks this new Tribeca spot is a wine bar, because it's owned and operated by the same people responsible for Aria, the West Village's most rustic and hilarious place to drink Nebbiolo. But I also sort of think it's a restaurant, because of the fact that they have a huge kitchen that turns out fresh pasta and all of the other 47 things on their menu. The question then becomes, who cares what you call it?
The short answer, is I do. Because I don't think you can call yourself a wine bar and then have poor options when it comes to wine. And before you fire up an email to me about how I probably don't know anything about wine and probably don't even know that Chianti can be really great, a) I get it and b) that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the fact that the cheapest decent bottle here is in the $70 range, and it's not even one of those good value situations. The wine list here is just way too expensive.
So maybe it's just a restaurant then. How's the food? Pretty solid actually. Especially if you lean heavy on the small plates portion of the menu, going big on things like fried artichokes and meatballs. The pastas are decent too, but not worthy of many more words on the subject. So, if Terra is a restaurant, it's an average one. And still an expensive one.
The one thing we will say definitively about this place is that the room is amazing. It's dark, rustic, filled with candles, and even has great space for a big group and outdoor dining in the warmer months. So maybe it's neither a wine bar nor a restaurant. Maybe it's a place you come to have one glass of wine or maybe a cocktail, especially if you don't mind spending some money. And maybe down here Tribeca, that's all it needs to be."

It’s that awesome NYC restaurant depicted in your favorite Woody Allen flick, one that probably doesn’t exist in real life... except it does. It is also pretty much exactly the same as it was when we first weighed in on it back in 2010, and we’d bet that not much will change in the decade to come. Restaurants come and go in this city, things change, trends happen, yet Raoul’s keeps on chugging. Now it just has even more action because it gets overflow from The Dutch across the street.
Raoul’s is useful for a variety of different things. Having dinner with friends from out of town you want to impress with a classic New York evening?

So think of it this way: Mimi Cheng’s is the Silicon Alley startup of dumplings. They even have those bright yellow Ikea stools that we’ve seen at every new tech company in Flatiron. And yes, they have some very good dumplings.
Of course, many places do, and all startups are sure to come across naysayers who think the existing technology is just fine. So if you believe some kind of divine dumpling law states that all dumplings must be served in places with all the charm of the DMV, that’s just fine - and lucky for you, there’s no shortage of such establishments.
Mimi Cheng’s is a spiffed up version of the dumpling experience, which makes it pretty different from hitting up Vanessa’s or Tasty Dumpling. That means eco-friendly containers rather than styrofoam, and your order taken on an iPad with a smile. It means a really excellent, homemade tangy sauce, rather than crusty bottles of sriracha. It also means grass-fed chicken and pasture-raised pork. And finally, it means you’ll pay $8 for six dumplings, rather than $1.50.

It's pretty much impossible to land without wanting to punch yourself and or someone else in the face.
(Sorry, I just got off a flight.)
Thankfully, New Park Pizza is only a 12 minute ride from JFK. We don't have the category yet, but pencil this place in as the first (and possibly only) Perfect For On My Way To Or From JFK. New Park is not the premier pizza in the city, and Howard Beach is not the premier place to grab lunch, but when JFK is on your itinerary, it is worth considering a stop. You have to get to the airport 11 hours before your flight these days anyway, so you can afford another 20 minutes for a top-tier slice.
The trick out here is to order your pies or slices well done. As in “very well done, black on the bottom, char that sh*t up right.” For some reason, you are allowed the choice of not getting your pizza well done, which is a shame, because anybody who eats a not-crispy slice at New Park probably leaves wondering what the fuss is about.

For starters, we're all for hole-in-the-ground eating environments, and it's cute that Birds and Bubbles is located on Forsyth street, a name carrying much history in the chef's home state North Carolina. But there's almost nothing about this basement that exudes the character one might expect from a spot with such a gimmicky name and conceit, which as the name indicates, is all about fried chicken and ""bubbly.""
But if you're going to make fried chicken and champagne a thing, at least go all-in on the interior decorating so it doesn't feel like the extra $50 you're trying to charge us for a bottle of wine we didn't order is to cover the cost of an immersive experience. Every sip of booze you have at Birds & Bubbles, like the refreshing flowery June Bug cocktail, will please you. But this place is pricey. Are we naive for thinking a restaurant between Delancey and Canal that implores you to drink champagne should offer more than one bottle under $70? Sparkling wine it is, y'all.
Even if you make a reservation, you still might have to wait 30 minutes to be seated. But do everything possible to avoid sitting at the bar. They have about six stools and around ten square feet of dedicated space for this area, yet the bartenders will still find a way to ignore you until you employ violent hand acrobatics to get their attention. The wait staff at the tables, at least, are very nice and honest when helping you figure out how much to order for the table.
Most importantly, the food at Birds & Bubbles is fine. The deviled eggs, the grits and yes, the bucket of chicken are all well-deserved house favorites. But in a post-Root and Bone world, we simply found ourselves looking for a reason to get excited beyond the fact that this is yet another fried chicken concept. And we didn't exactly find it.
At the end of the day, I'm just not sure that Birds & Bubbles is worth your time. We're picky about any attempt to bring Southern dining to the city streets, and there are just so many other places to overspend on fried bird in this town.

Your decision should rely on whether or not you're part of it."

",2.0,Tacos,Empellon Al Pastor,8.0,"New York City has recently come a long way with regards to the taco. A couple of years ago, we were just on the hunt for a decent taco. These days, with the recent influx of new options like Los Tacos No. 1, Otto’s, Taqueria Diana and Tacos Morelos among others, the bar has been raised. Well, there’s another new addition taco enthusiasts need to get on their radars immediately. Empellón Al Pastor is the latest in unlikely Mexican EEEEEATS hero Alex Stupak’s stable of hot sauce jams.
Stupak is obsessed with the glorious taco named Al Pastor, which involves pork shoulder that’s been cooked on a spit, with some pineapple in the mix for good measure. There is no juicier, no more flavorful, no more satisfying taco in the world, in our opinion. At Empellón Al Pastor, they’re doing right by the spit.
The set up is great too: you order food at the counter on one end, and alcoholic beverages on the other. The place is actually really a bar more than anything, with 17 beers on tap, an entire menu worth of Micheladas, and more mezcal and tequila than you’ll know what to do with. They ship corn in from Mexico to make their own masa for corn tortillas on site, and no one in NYC makes better salsas than Stupak. They’re incredible. In addition to a pristine Al Pastor taco, the beef with caramelized onions is excellent as well.
New York will never be San Diego or LA or Austin or San Francisco or Mexico for that matter, but we’ve definitely got some legitimate taco options to choose from now, few of which are better than Empellón Al Pastor."

",2.0,East Village,Brodo,7.1,"Allow us to begin with a small thought experiment. You've been hired by a large marketing agency, and you’ve been tasked with creating a brilliant viral marketing campaign somehow related to the current state of food culture in New York. They’re thinking a pop-up, maybe? Something like that, but you know, a fresh take. “We want Alex From Target, but for food!” they say. The budget is pretty good, but they also want you to profit on this. Let's brainstorm a bit. Here's the proposal we'd probably put together:
1. Specialize in a single item.
2. Make that item something that everyone likes, but which, somehow, no one else has ever thought of selling as a standalone item previously.
3. Make it something that will make people say, ""Wait, really?""
4. Followed by, ""Oh! I'd be into that. When can we go?""
5. Make the item kind of old school.
6. Connect it to an already established and beloved restaurant.
7. Serve the item in a slightly unconventional container, but one that also totally makes sense.
8. Add in some sort of funky, contemporary toppings to modernize the thing.
9. Convince people there are vague but excellent health benefits to be had.
Congratulations. Together, we have just created Brodo.
Brodo is a small window attached to the East Village mainstay Hearth, and it serves broth. The broth gets served in coffee cups, and there are three flavors: chicken broth, gingered beef broth, and Hearth broth - a combination of beef, chicken, and turkey bones. If you add toppings (turmeric, chili oil, and beets are among the options), a large will run you just over $10, while a small (depending on the flavor) is just under five bucks. Apparently, it is the new green juice.
Anyway, you wanted to know about the soup? It's good. Consider this: a seasoned restaurant is dedicating part of its kitchen to making hot broth to sell to people standing out in the cold. Of course it's going to be pretty good.  
Here's the catch: Brodo is real.
... Or is it?
We thought about how to categorize Brodo on the Infatuation — should we add a Perfect For ""Broth"" category? And we also thought about how to rate Brodo. But what exactly are we supposed to compare it to? Until we hear a convincing case that Brodo isn't punking us, or until there are so many broth shops that it's like the Frozen Yogurt Wars of 2009, we're leaving Brodo in a category of its own. Broth. It's what's for dinner. Or afternoon snack. Or whenever it is you're supposed to eat broth."

",3.0,Pizza,Marta,7.3,"If you follow any of the food industry news sites out there, you’ve probably heard all about this “white hot” “blockbuster” of an opening. Blockbuster? Eh, more like the restaurant equivalent of Hollywood Video. Marta has got all the hits in stock, but the in-store experience just isn’t as hot.Here’s the thing about Marta, Danny Meyer’s new pizzeria inside the Martha Washington Hotel located in the exact place where Flatiron, NoMad, and Murray Hill meet: the space is really bad. If it feels like eating inside a sterile hotel lobby, well, that’s because you are. Plenty of hotels have restaurants inside them, but they’re usually separate entities that have their own identities. At Marta, you literally walk into the front door, dodge the bellman, and check in at what might as well be the concierge desk.
Feel is such an important element to dining out (see, The Feel Good Factor™). Some restaurants have got it going on and others simply don’t. Unfortunately, Marta does not. We’re weighing so heavily on the room here because it’s always such a key component to the Danny Meyer hospitality experience. If anyone knows how important that special feeling is, it’s Meyer, who we have a lot of respect for. Maybe because this one was just a pizza joint, he let that part slide, but this place doesn’t feel like everything else he’s done.
What Marta does have going on are some pretty damn tasty Roman-style pizzas, and a roster of other stuffed and fried things to eat before you get to the main event. The food is definitely delicious - there’s no question about that - but it also isn’t good enough to make us go out of our way to come back. That being said, you can do a lot worse for a power lunch in a part of town that doesn’t have a ton happening restaurant-wise, or for a post-Madison Square Garden dinner. Here’s to hoping they start delivering soon."

",3.0,Italian,Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria,8.6,"You know what makes me angry? The fact that right now, at this very minute, someone, somewhere (probably in Britain) is buying tickets to see Queen with Adam Lambert. I’m sorry, but I’ll just never understand why anyone would pay money to see a live desecration of “I Want To Break Free” sung by someone not named Freddie Mercury - especially when that someone came from American Idol. That’s not Queen. That’s Queen karaoke.
Now, before word makes it to the “Glamberts” that I’ve slandered their king, and before the virtual pitchforks come out, let me make myself clear. I absolutely do think that Adam Lambert sucks. But I am making that point here in this restaurant review for a reason. You see, in most situations, be it music, sports, or television, you cannot have a significant core lineup change and simply carry on as though everything remains the same. It didn’t work for whatever that first Dumb and Dumber sequel was, it didn’t work on Two And A Half Men after Charlie Sheen got awesome, and I don’t care what you say, it didn’t work for Van Halen either. David Lee Roth forever.
Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria recently had a pretty significant lineup change of its own, when their longtime chef left to open a new establishment with Stephen Starr, the restaurant industry’s Simon Cowell. Being that this place has been in our regular rotation ever since we first reviewed it back in 2011, this was a concerning development. We generally dislike change, especially when it relates to whether or not short rib sandwiches will be available to us for lunch. As a result, we’ve been back to Il Buco AV several (seven) times over the last few months to see what’s changed with a new lead singer at the helm, sure to be bummed out by a bunch of Adam Lambert interpretations of their greatest hits.But here’s the thing. That’s not what happened at all. Believe it or not, Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria has somehow gotten better with the new lineup. The key classics are all there - short rib sandwiches and excellent pasta included. But there are also some new dishes that impressed us in a way that nothing on the previous menu ever did - like roasted quail in a white chocolate sauce or a simple but incredible little gem salad. It almost feels as though there’s some California influence on this menu now, or maybe that’s just what eating fresh greens instead of brussels sprouts tells me. Either way, I like it.
Even with the new improvements, Il Buco is not a perfect restaurant - it’s always packed to the gills during dinner, and the communal seating situation will likely make your meal a social engagement with the strangers around you,
whether you’re into that sort of thing or not. Regardless, this is still one of the best restaurants in this city, and it’s perfectly reasonable to hit it for brunch or lunch if you can’t get in for dinner. As a matter of fact, it really doesn’t matter what time you go. Just go before they change their lineup again. Good things aren’t meant to last forever. Now someone please pass that message along to Brian May."

",3.0,BBQ,Arrogant Swine,4.9,"Arrogant Swine couldn’t have a more appropriate name. They’ve got plenty of tasty swine, including outside brown shoulder and whole hog barbecue platters, plus sausage and pork belly specials. And they’ve got plenty of arrogance, dramatically under-delivering on what they claim is true Carolina-style barbecue.
If it opened 10 years ago, before spots like Fette Sau and John Brown Smokehouse changed NYC’s BBQ game, Arrogant Swine might have gotten away with the kind of good, but not great food they’re selling. But even then, you can’t train under one of the best pitmasters in Raleigh and claim you’re bringing Carolina ‘cue to Bushwick, then deliver something that tastes like it’s from a half-hearted drive-through off a dead stretch of I-85. It might taste good, but it’s nowhere near a worthy representation of what the Carolinas have to offer.
Perhaps I'm disappointed because my favorite vinegar-based style is under-represented on the menu. Or maybe I let the several N.C. natives I've consumed Arrogant Swine food with get to my head with their ""this is bullsh*t,"" banter. Either way, we can't dole too much praise for this new spot. The food is okay, their draft beer options are good, and the environment is sexier than you might expect from a restaurant carved into an old garage in Bushwick. You just won't learn anything about what true Carolina BBQ is supposed to taste like, which unless I misread his 8,000 interviews, was Tyson Ho’s motive all along. I can’t help but wonder what Ed Mitchell would think."

",2.0,Mexican,Chavela's,7.9,"You know what we suddenly have plenty of in this town? Tacos. They're almost as ubiquitous as oysters in New York City restaurants these days, to the point that I think they might actually be pulling pork stuffed tortillas out of Manhasset Bay and shipping them to the East Village daily. But you know what we still don't have enough of? Good, honest Mexican restaurants. Mexican restaurants that aren't afraid to serve hot bowl of nothing but queso, because what did you come here for in the first place? Carrots? Get out.
Then again, if you live in Crown Heights, none of what I am saying probably makes any sense to you. Because you have Chavela's.
Chavela's is the perfect example of what a ""Mexican restaurant"" means to the majority of the country outside of New York City. It's loud, it's fun, it's full of tequila and cheese enchiladas, and it's pretty much the best thing ever, even when the food is just ""good"". Luckily, Chavela's is good pretty much always, and that's probably why it's pretty much always packed.
Your best bet for having success in this restaurant is to hit it for brunch, specifically with a big group of friends, and most importantly when you don't have much else on your schedule for the afternoon. You'll definitely have to wait for your table, and you'll probably end up drinking more than you planned to. But that's what's so great about brunch in a Mexican restaurant. You came here to have a good time. Not to eat oysters."

",2.0,American,Communal,6.9,"I love to cook. And when I do, I try to cook healthy to make up for the rest of my lifestyle which looks exactly like our Instagram feed: chock full of egregious, gorgeous things to eat that typically aren't great for your body. But sometimes I want to eat well without slow roasting my own damn tomatoes, which is where Communal comes into play.
Atmosphere-wise, Communal borrows its sex appeal from Penelope and its tunes from Kidz Bop. We'll call that a wash. The service quality can be dicey, varying by time of day and number of people on staff, but the menu makes up for it. Communal’s juices and smoothies give any über pricey specialty shop a run for their money. Their signature flatbreads are unique, but not so outlandish that you can't tell if you're eating a pizza vs. a deconstructed burrito. And their other salads, sandwiches, and large pizza options can accommodate all tastes and hunger levels.
We mostly recommend this spot for lunch, especially because the food carries out well and it's located close to the park. But personally, it's my go-to after hitting a class at the 77th St. SoulCycle. That whole 45-minute sweat fest followed by Meatball Shop hoagie routine was getting a little dangerous."

",3.0,Italian,Rucola,6.9,"We wrote a review of Rucola three years ago, mostly focused on the fact that local food media had created so much hype around the opening of this restaurant that it would be impossible for it to live up to the expectations of anyone who was expecting it to be more than just a solid neighborhood joint. We certainly tried to love this place as much as the internet wanted us to, but it always came up short.
Lately we've been making return visits to Rucola, interested to see how things have developed, and to see what happens to a ""buzz"" restaurant after the foodie-industrial complex has moved on and stopped supporting a place because it's no longer new. What we can tell you is that Rucola is definitely better than it was in the early days. We still don't find the food to be so good that it's worth your time on the subway or waiting for a table if you don't live nearby. But if you happen to own a brownstone down the street, this is pretty much the perfect neighborhood restaurant (and congratulations on your perfect life). It's small and cozy and Perfect For a Sunday night dinner, assuming you weren't hoping to have the best meal of your entire life on that particular Sunday night.
We can also tell you that Rucola does not need us or anyone else to write reviews of it or make maps of it or take pictures of its avocado toast to stay in business. This place is on a permanent 45 minute wait, which would lead us to believe that the people of Brooklyn don't really care that this restaurant doesn't get written about anymore. That, or those ""first look"" pieces just have really long legs. People do love a pretty picture."

",3.0,American,Lucky Strike,7.5,"Before you continue, let’s be clear about one thing - this is not a review for a bowling alley in Times Square. Office managers stressing over the plans for corporate happy hour, look elsewhere. But if you’re looking for a French bistro in Soho that’s been open for 25 years where you can feel like you’re in one of the tame parts of a Bret Easton Ellis novel, read on.
Keith McNally opened Lucky Strike in 1989, and for some reason, it’s lesser known than its similarly long-lived McNally counterparts Balthazar, Schiller’s, and The Odeon. Maybe that’s because people think it’s a bowling alley. Whatever the reason, we happen to like it a lot. Here’s why.
On our last visit, the soundtrack was an alternating rotation of Depeche Mode and Michael Jackson and every table had drinks on it despite it being early on a Monday night. And speaking of drinks, when you order a martini or old fashioned or other appropriately strong drink (this place has been around since 1989 but that doesn’t make it OK to order a Cosmopolitan), you get an extra tall glass with crushed ice, a strainer, and the remaining part of the cocktail that didn’t fit into the first glass. In other words: one martini is actually approximately 1.5 martinis. Let this serve as your official warning.
We also like Lucky Strike because it works perfectly in a number of situations. You could, for example, come in with a friend and grab one of the tiny, crowded-together tables in the front and share a steak frites - there isn’t really room for two plates on the table anyway. You might grab a quick glass of wine at the copper bar. If we’re getting serious, you might even linger in the back with a group until 2:30 a.m. on a Saturday night.
There’s just one thing it’s not good for: bowling."

",2.0,Diner,Mooncake Foods,7.4,"Explaining Mooncake Foods to newcomers can present something of a challenge. It’s sort of vaguely healthy Asian food, but not healthy in an organic green juice kind of way. And it’s in Soho, but not in the part where some old guy is selling old movie scripts and bad paintings on the street. It also kind of looks like a greasy spoon diner. But in a good way.
Everything about Mooncake Foods basically follows the “in a good way” formula. This includes the down to the impossible to pin down clientele - on our last weekday evening visit, the only other patrons were a pair of French girls who shared an order of dumplings and cheap glasses of wine, and a guy sitting alone in a leather jacket. In a good way!
So go alone and sit at the counter, go with a friend and sit in the window on a cold winter day, or go with a group - at Mooncake, there are no rules.
Except there is one rule: green sauce. All meals at Mooncake should revolve around the restaurant’s signature spicy green sauce, which is kind of like a tangier, more aesthetically-pleasing Sriracha addictive enough it should possibly be regulated as a controlled substance. But it’s not regulated because NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT IS. The recipe is secret and it’s not for sale. We’ve asked.
Green sauce seems to bring people back - and Mooncake has built a small empire on it, with three other locations in the Financial District, Hell’s Kitchen, and Chelsea. We can’t attest to the quality of cool, weird diner vibes at the other locations, but we can attest to the fact that they have the green sauce, and to the fact that they will deliver to your doorstep. Not always promptly, but as you should know by now: Mooncake is not like most restaurants.
So stop worrying about how to explain this place to your friends, and get to this corner of Soho you probably forgot existed and get to this weird little Asian diner you never knew you needed."

",2.0,Sandwiches,Blossom Du Jour,7.2,"We at The Infatuation are equal opportunity food lovers. We range from eating highly unhealthy all the way to moderately unhealthy, and we give it all a fair shot. Which is why I feel I have license to say that one of my favorite lunch spots on the Upper West Side is a vegan one. Yes, the girl who worships fried chicken and has a bacon bowl on her Christmas list is pretty much in love with Blossom du Jour.
Context is important here. Unlike the East Villages and NoHos of the world, the Upper West is a challenging place to find a good, quick, and not completely overpriced lunch outside of the Chipotle and Lenny's rotation. I’m not proud of those being in my mix, but if you work or live up here, you know how hard it can be to find variety. And variety is where Blossom du Jour excels.
Stating the obvious, but nearly everything on the menu at Blossom du Jour is pretty good for you and 100% vegan friendly. And no matter what you're in the mood for - a funky smoothie, a savory sandwich, or a super fresh salad -Blossom has you covered. Even non-vegan folks like myself who occasionally dabble in the dark art of consuming meatless meals will be satisfied by their “tuna” melt, “meatball” sub, and burrito.
Know that only some of the locations - Blossom is also in Chelsea and Midtown West - have counter space where you can sit, and this particular location is take-out only. But it's a highly dependable option if you’re planning to take a lunch into work or Central Park or wherever people hang out during the day in this part of town.

This is and always has been where New York City’s most attractively unemployed people come to have breakfast at noon.Though The Smile has been open for several years now, we’re betting you still haven’t heard much about it - probably because you actually have a job. Situated a few steps below the sidewalk on Bond Street, it’s a place that you have to be looking for to see, and for people other than the models and musicians that fill it for most of the day, it remains relatively under the radar. Yes, brunch and breakfast are popular (and very good), but The Smile doesn’t tend to get overrun by people during either meal. Diners eat and linger, everyone seems to know each other, and everyone looks really good - even with dirty hair and last night’s clothes on.
Dinner at The Smile is surprisingly good, too. Imagine Freemans without the two-hour wait, though also know that it’s probably not a good spot for a first date, just because The Smile really is a cafe more than anything else. A cafe full of models. And that is probably not where you want to have your first date with anyone."

",3.0,Pizza,Rubirosa,9.2,"Reading our old reviews is like digging up a time capsule. What was I doing back in 2011 when we first wrote up Rubirosa? Apparently hanging out in Nolita a lot and using the word “hip” to describe cool things. “The Infatuation: Restaurant Reviews From Your Dad.”
Even though I might not be any more “hip” these days, I do like to think that I am at least consistent. All of the things I wrote about Rubirosa in 2011 are true today. This is one of the most consistently excellent Italian restaurants in town. It happens to still be pretty “turnt up,” too. (Let’s see how well that one holds up in a few years.)The story at Rubirosa remains the same - two guys named Angelo are responsible for it, one whose family owns a legendary pizza place in Staten Island, and the other a once well-known doorman at The Beatrice Inn. They are now more famous for Rubirosa’s vodka sauce pizza than either of those two biographical facts, and for good reason. It’s one of the best pies in New York City, and you definitely need to make a trip here just to eat it. But one of the things we love most about this restaurant is that it’s not a one trick pony. This isn’t just a pizza joint. This is a real Italian restaurant with ridiculously good food, from the antipasti to the pasta to the rainbow cookies at the end of the meal. It’s Perfect For Date Night, great for Dinner With The Parents, and there’s even an extensive gluten-free menu that they’ve had since the day they opened.
As it stands today, the only difference between Rubirosa and some of New York’s most classic Italian restaurants is time. I guarantee you that when we dig up the capsule again 40 years from now, this place will still be on Mulberry Street. And I’ll probably still be writing restaurant reviews, trying to figure out what the 2044 word for “cool” is."

",3.0,Seafood,The Boil,5.8,"The Boil is a Lower East Side attempt at a New Orleans hangout. The room is packed with big, boozy groups, the menu is full of fresh seafood, and the bar has Abita on tap. You order shellfish by the pound and Cajun seasoning can be found on pretty much everything. Hell, there's even a fleur-de-lis on the wall, and I'm pretty sure those can't leave the city unless the NoLa mayor officially signs off on it.
Oh, you can buy those anywhere? They sell them in those year round Halloween stores, for no apparent reason? There are like 400 girls in Maryland that have a fleur-de-lis tattoo because it looked cool and they were drunk in Ocean City? My bad. That's good to know. Because New Orleans is a dream. And The Boil kind of sucks.
The menu at The Boil will have you ordering crawfish, shrimp, lobster, and crab by the pound, with your choice of sauce and heat. It's a perfect blueprint for hands on eating with a side of beer - except just about none of it works. The seafood itself is decent, and eating out of a garbage bag is fun, but everything else is a step in the wrong direction. The garlic butter sauce is thick and overpowering, masking the taste of the seafood. And the heat index is a joke. The hottest level (""fire"") is sadly unintimidating, even if the waitstaff acts like an order of it will leave you seizing on the floor.
The only way to do The Boil right is to ignore all the bells and whistles (and asterisks on the menu) and go with seafood in Old Bay. Full stop. Two pounds of shrimp with nothing but Old Bay is a legit meal here. Ditto the crab and fries. The problem is, waiting over an hour to eat Cajun fries isn't much of a setup. Especially when the entire experience is tainted by everybody wearing plastic gloves as they eat. (You know, because we're being diligent around here.) Nothing says ""never been to the bayou"" like rocking surgical gloves to protect your no polish manicure. I'm not even sure they'll let you do that in Ocean City."

",3.0,Italian,Zero Otto Nove,8.2,"You know you're at the right place when you see the old, sky blue Fiat sitting on the sidewalk. It´s so cheesy, it could only come from someone who really means this sh*t. But let´s face it, you probably count as a tourist by being in the Bronx anyway, and half of the fun of Trattoria Zero Otto Nove is just visiting Arthur Avenue - New York´s final, shrinking, and honest-to-Santa Maria Little Italy. Get there before the stores close and buy some fresh Italian products from any one of the shops on the block. Need some help? Here's a map.
When you walk into Zero Otto Nove, you’ll notice some fanny-packed tourists nervously huddled next to a few heavily gold-chained, vaguely Paulie Walnuts-like types at the bar. Don't mind them. The hostess will bring you down a dark, skinny hallway that looks like an alley and feels like something from [insert lame Mafia joke I promised myself I wouldn't make in this review]. You then might have to duck under a few oncoming trays of food before ending up in the main dining room, which looks like a courtyard in an Italian village. I know, after the Fiat thing this probably sounds tacky as hell, but just trust us.
Once you reach the main dining room, you'll find it plastered with Italian political posters and various advertisements featuring women with absurdly big boobs and dudes in very tight shirts. It´s two floors, lit by giant sunlights, and centered around a huge pizza oven, which, by the way, will be giving you at least one pizza. All of this will please you.
Eventually you will make your way to some food food, which is excellent. Zero Otto Nove is run by a chef from the southern Italian region of Campania, Roberto Paciulo, who, luckily for us, is hell bent on colonizing this city. He knows his audience: a neighborhood that demands the classics in a city that demands the best. He´s also successfully pandering to Americans whose last name end in vowels and who seek out any and all connections to the fabled 'patria.'
Because of all that, the more or less static menu reflects a few red sauce standards, staples from Campania, and house created dishes. But the huge specials list is really where you need to be. These aren't the kind of specials made up from some tilapia because it didn't sell over the weekend, or truffle-flavor anything for that matter because Roberto is better than that. If it's in season, he's got a big, fat box of real truffles in the kitchen ready for deployment and he's definitely not selling you some old trash fish. Through his daily specials, Roberto tends to introduce ingredients and ideas that may have escaped older, more traditional Italian chefs who never had access to the range of products we have today.
Adding to it all is Zero Otto Nove's freakishly good-looking staff. Call me a sucker, but when a heavily accented European of any kind repeatedly throws his hands in the air and offers a three minute long explanation of just one special, I´m in. Bonus points if his eyes roll back in his head. This guy is getting paid like, three bucks an hour, but it's clear that he is just going to die if you don't try tonight's pasta in foil special. Order it along with the bottle of Barolo he's swearing on, let him hit on every woman at the table, and enjoy your trip."

",3.0,American,Meadowsweet,8.4,"There’s this thing. It’s called The Feel Good Factor™. And it’s actually the thing that makes you want to go back to a certain restaurant. It’s not the food, it’s not the service, it’s not whether or not they have upscale tater tots on the menu. It’s the FGF, and if you own an eating establishment of any kind, it’s the secret to creating a successful business.
Why doesn’t anybody talk about The Feel Good Factor™? Mostly because we’ll litigate. It cost us a lot of money to register a trademark for the sole purpose of this review, and we intend to defend against any and all infringement with fervor. But also because it’s a hard thing to quantify. To be honest, we probably couldn’t tell you what the exact equation for exceptionally high FGF is. We can only tell you whether or not a certain place has it. And Meadowsweet absolutely does.
Meadowsweet is the new restaurant in the space that was once home to Brooklyn favorite Dressler, brought to you by the one-time chef of Dressler. It was recently awarded a Michelin star, which we suppose is an indication that someone (besides us) likes it here. But stars don’t tell much of a story. And they certainly don’t make you feel good.
What does make you feel good is when you’re eating a plate of something awesome while sitting in a comfortable chair in a nicely appointed room and then The Rolling Stones' “Monkey Man” comes on over the speakers. Or when you order a bottle of wine, and they realize that they’ve run out of it but then recommend something that turns out to be even better. It’s that moment that you realize that a place has enough intangible positive qualities that you’re willing to forgive a dish that’s too salty because f*ck it, I feel good, and I have water. That’s the Feel Good Factor™ in a nutshell, and all of those things are happening at this restaurant.
So if you’re looking for more detail about what exactly makes Meadowsweet a place worth coming to, then we're sorry. You won’t find that here because we can’t offer it to you today. What we can tell you is that this place makes us feel good, and we want to go back. And maybe that’s all you need to know."

",2.0,American,Poulette,7.9,"""That cute rotisserie chicken place in Hell's Kitchen"" is a phrase we never planned on thinking, saying, or writing. Despite being fully in love with pre-made poultry, rotisserie chicken still makes us think of sad single dudes eating in their underwear. And for the most part, Hell's Kitchen makes us think of the same thing. There's something perfect about a rotisserie bird, it's just not one of the classier, cuter meals around. Unless you're part of a small subset of Craigslist creeps out there, it's rare for a nice dinner to involve ripping bones apart with your hands and sucking salty skin-grease off your fingers one by one.
But Poulette kinda sorta almost changes that.
It's not that Poulette has reinvented the rotisserie chicken. In fact, the meal is pretty much exactly what you've come to expect from your heat lamp'd grocery display. But somewhere between the veggie sides, the dining area, and overall presentation (bye-bye chicken in a bag, helloooo chicken in a box), Poulette successfully scales up the entire rotisserie experience.
The space is nice, with a few countertops and stools. Nothing shmance, but it's clean, which sets it apart from most places on Ninth Avenue. And most importantly, it's a step above your couch and Boston Market, which is where a lot of rotisserie meals are consumed. This added touch of class is a welcome change - but it comes at a price. While Whole Foods and Fairway sell a full bird for around $8-10, Poulette asks $17.75 for its version. It markets each chicken as a plump and organic 3-pounder, but even still, that's steep for what is supposed to be a cheap option. Regardless, there are deals to be had and our go-to is the $17 half bird meal, which comes with your choice of two sides, almost all of which are excellent. Going solo on an entire chicken is a bit much, anyway, and no date should witness that kind of carnivorous destruction. Unless, again, well...Craigslist."

",2.0,Sandwiches,Parm,8.1,"It's been a good few years for Team Torrisi, starting with the days when they
had one restaurant on Mulberry Street, and it was equally celebrated for both
the tasting menu they served by night and the turkey sandwiches they served by
day. Those were simpler times, before the uber-hyped openings of
Carbone and ZZ's
Clam Bar and Dirty French, and before the New York Times wrote an
article comparing them to the Beastie Boys (what?).
It was around then that we first reviewed Parm, just as it separated from
Torrisi as a standalone sandwich shop and Italian diner. We, much like
everyone else in this town, liked the food here from the get-go. We, like
everyone else, still visit quite a bit. And now that the hype has died down
and the media is focused on whatever Mario C, Rich T and MC Z are working on
next, we decided to check back in, reassess, and refresh our review.
Not much has changed at Parm since it opened back in 2011, other than the fact
that there is one at Yankee Stadium, and there are probably about to be a lot
more of them around the city and ultimately the country. It would seem that
the intent is to ""Shake Shack"" this thing, and yes, now that's a verb. That's
what happens when your restaurant chain is valued at a billion dollars. So the
fact that sandwiches are just as good as they've always been probably bodes
well for this group's plans to Parm the USA.
The rest of the story essentially remains the same. There's some novelty to
Parm that probably earns them some favor that menu outside of sandwiches
doesn't, and that's perfectly fine. If you stick to the superstar items (as
detailed in the Food Rundown), you'll definitely enjoy your meal, and you'll
probably want to come back. Is it a timeless classic, like Check Your Head, or
Paul's Boutique? No it isn't. Why? Because this is food, not the f*cking
Beastie Boys."

",1.0,Diner,Tom's Restaurant,7.7,"You know what people love? Free stuff. You know how we know? Because we've met people. Thusly, we have decided that every restaurant would benefit from finding a way to give those people something for free. As a matter of fact, if a meal includes something served “on the house,” we’re going to 100% guarantee that said meal will be received with positive results, no matter the situation. The amuse bouche is always good (even when it’s not), a free drink is even better, and a plate of cookies with the check is essentially the blowjob of restaurateuring. As far as we can tell, free [insert thing here] is the solution to any and every restaurant-related problem.
Tom’s Restaurant, an old-school diner out in Prospect Heights, is well aware of this theory and has been successfully harnessing the power of the free sample since 1936. Open just for breakfast and lunch, Tom's sweet spot is the weekends, when the restaurant's standard customer lines up outside on Sunday morning, hungover and desperate to get a meal down in order to have something to throw up a few hours later while watching the Jets. That is pretty much the worst type of person imaginable (and is also me, weekly), and Tom's neutralizes this threat in the only logical way - by giving the people free sh*t. The staff preemptively works the line of patrons with platters of sausage, ham, fruit, cookies, pitchers of water, and cups coffee for all. For free. Take one or take six, because nobody but the person behind you in line is counting or cares.
Free food or otherwise, the good news here is that with the right mix of salt, grease, and sugar to calm even the crankiest of the crankies, Tom's has been satisfying for a long time. We definitely don't need the bonus treats to keep us coming back - but we certainly aren't complaining about them either."

",2.0,Ramen,Totto Ramen East,7.9,"This city needs more ramen restaurants like it needs more privileged people.
But guess what? We're getting more of both anyway. At least on the ramen
front, the right kind of restaurants seem to be the ones multiplying. I'm not
sure we can say so much for the additional humans.
Totto Ramen is most definitely the right kind of ramen - at least for our
tastes. This Midtown East location brings the chain's New York City
count to three, and all of them have the same vibe - a cool (often tiny) room,
good music, and very nice people. The food is pretty damn excellent too.
Here on East 52nd Street, Totto is situated directly under Hide
Chan, another
Infatuation go-to for ramen - especially for late night. The curious thing is
that Hide Chan is also owned by the same group that owns Totto. So they are
either hoping that the competition makes both restaurants better, or they're
taking the NYC real estate approach to their expansion and just building sh*t
wherever they can find a space. Either way, it'll probably work.
Our plan is to keep frequenting both Hide Chan and Totto, using each for
different needs. Hide Chan will always be the place we head for when a 2am
shot of hot pork broth is necessary (often). This location of Totto will be
our spot for daytime ramen anytime life calls for lunch on the east side of
Midtown (hopefully not that often).
As for how you'll use them, that's up to you. Navigate them in such a way that
they'll serve your needs. Much like you would when it comes to all these
people."

",3.0,American,The Eddy,8.5,"I moved to New York City in July of 2002, a time when your best resource for finding information on things was often not this new thing called “the internet” but instead some version of words on paper. I was new to the city and highly interested in restaurants, and I often found myself frustrated when trying to sort through my options. Why?
Let’s take New York Magazine for example. Back then, their restaurant listings were relegated to the back of the book, and space limitations basically allowed for about three sentences worth of copy to summarize each place. And you know what made me crazy? The fact that two of those sentences were almost always devoted to calling out the credentials of some chef that I’d never heard of. That information simply wasn’t relevant or useful to me. I just wanted to know whether or not I should spend what little money I had on a meal there.
Ultimately, that frustration is what led us to start The (Immaculate) Infatuation, and here we are today. What’s funny is that for all that has changed since 2002, when it comes to food media, very much is the same. Most of the people covering this stuff still focus on the “who” rather than the “why.”
The “why” is what brings us to today’s review. I have absolutely no idea who the chef of The Eddy is. None. I don’t know where he or she trained, I don’t know who his or her mentors are, and I know nothing of the philosophy that this person brings to the kitchen. What I do know is that I love this restaurant, and I think you will, too. Here are the reasons.
The Eddy is a tiny little place, but it has a ton of New York charm. This is one of those restaurants that you sit in on a snowy Friday night and order a second bottle of wine because f*ck it, you own this town, and nobody is waking you up early tomorrow. It’s also Perfect For any type of date, especially one with four people because you’ll be guaranteed a bigger table and a bit more room to make charming hand gestures (never fails). The good news is that regardless of where you sit, the service will be excellent. For an East Village restaurant, this is a pretty upscale experience, and the staff is trained accordingly. The wine list is serious but affordable and accessible, and the details have been attended to - like nice glassware and a bottle that’s served at the right temperature.
As for the food, the menu is your choice of a $65 tasting or a la carte. We recommend the order-at-will approach, but the tasting is a good move if you want to spend less time thinking (and more time hand gesturing). You will see some bar snacks listed, but make no mistake - this menu is advanced. You probably don’t want to bring a picky friend, but you definitely do want to bring a friend that would be into eating some beef tendon puff or having some chicken skin mixed in with the burrata. Don’t have any friends like that? You need to start running with a new crowd.
Maybe that’s what the back pages of the magazine are for."

But in spirit, it's not a taqueria. This is a temple to the holy San Francisco burrito. Pray before it, lest you be forsaken.
Too often in this city do we come across lost souls - those who worship false idols, elevating mediocre tacos to heavenly status. And yet they know nothing of the glory of a true burrito from the West, filled with al pastor and guacamole and unconditional love. To those people we say, if you cannot make it to the promised land, let Diana be your New York shepherd. For it is she who will make you a true believer.
We have been lucky enough to witness the almighty Mission burrito with our own eyes (and mouths) on many occasions, and we've come here today to testify to Taqueria Diana's legitimacy. This burrito is who it claims to be - a prophet sent from the sacred streets of San Francisco, here to bring us all salvation. No longer shall you search for satisfaction amongst impostors, only shall you know true devotion. It is pure and it is good and it will fill your heart and stomach with warmth - mostly from pork and salsa.

",3.0,Bar Food,Jones Wood Foundry,7.8,"We decided that an update on our old Jones Wood Foundry review was in order, not because this place has changed much since we originally wrote it up in 2011, but because we’ve come to appreciate it even more.
Our initial reaction upon discovering this cool British pub and restaurant was to be pleasantly surprised that something like this could exist on the Upper East Side and not just be another ridiculous dive called The Fox and The Hound or Queen Mary’s Banger House. You know the type of place - the Union Jack on the wall and Guinness on tap and some guy who is hammered at 2pm pretending to give a sh*t about soccer. Jones Wood Foundry is far better and far more authentic than that. The food here is excellent. And their drunk guys really do care about soccer.
But what we’ve come to realize over time is that the beauty of Jones Wood Foundry is not simply in the fact that this a better British pub than most in this city. What makes it unique is that this is also an excellent utility restaurant for just about every need an Upper East Side resident might have. Looking to watch Premiere League at 10am? You can do it here. Need a spot to bring your buddy from Chicago who loves to hang out and eat well but hates trendy places? This is your spot. Looking for brunch outside on a nice summer afternoon? The small patio at Jones Wood Foundry is almost always available. You can even hold a big group event here if you want to, assuming everyone can get down with the fact that there’s no liquor behind the bar. Your aunt probably needs to lay off the vodka martinis anyway.
For us, we find Jones Wood Foundry most useful for some daytime eating. We hit it frequently for brunch after a run in Central Park, or anytime we want to get food on a Saturday afternoon and not deal with people who go to brunch. Dinner is good, too, especially if you’re having the Meyers of Keswick Bangers & Mash with a Woodland Mushroom Salad on the side. Pair that up with a Taddy Porter or a pint of cask ale, and you’ll be doing the British pub thing the way it was meant to be done. Just don’t let anyone know that you call it soccer."

Krupa Grocery has never been mentioned on GrubStreet and there was certainly no first look on Eater.

had. A small operation with friendly people, incredible tap beers, an
impressive, well priced wine list, and food that competes at the highest
level. Each dish that comes out of the Krupa kitchen is better than the next,
with subtle nuances to each that suggest cook game proper. The house made

",2.0,American,Hudson Clearwater,8.1,"As we continue to re-review our earlier Infatuation hits, we’ve generally found that excellent restaurants have mostly remained excellent and that the ones in the middle - the good ones - have had mixed results thanks to a litany of ownership, location, and chef change-ups. So it’s rare we find a good spot that’s gotten significantly better without a complete overhaul, but Hudson Clearwater has done just that.
Hudson Clearwater is largely the same restaurant that it was in our initial review in 2011. You still enter from a sort-of-hidden side door. Their quaint little patio is still romantic as f*ck. And their staff, while extremely friendly, still beg the age old #HomelessOrHipster question. But there’s one significant improvement that resulted in today’s upgraded rating - the menu. We could never get around some of the curveballs that this place threw at us in our early days of eating here, and we must not have been alone. It seems that Hudson Clearwater has turned down the funk a bit in favor of more appetizing things that don’t rely on weirdness to impress.
The other thing we initially disliked about this place - the crowd - has also improved. We don’t know where the UrbanDaddy bros have moved on to, but we're betting it’s underground and has tequila on tap. Either way, Hudson Clearwater seems to have settled into a more mellow West Village crowd, and for that we’re thankful.
At the end of the day, we can now fully embrace Hudson Clearwater as one of the better restaurants in this part of town, especially during the summer months when their backyard is in full swing. What prompted the changes for the better? Don’t know. Don’t care.

But even though we have to cover a lot of ground, there are a few spots we return to often because they are Perfect For so many things. Jeffrey’s Grocery is the ideal example of that. This is one of the few restaurants in this city where we’re legitimate regulars.
When Jeffrey’s Grocery first opened, it was a kitschy little cafe that also tried peddling groceries. Realizing that there was absolutely no need to sell milk and eggs to people who were just looking to go face deep into some raw bar, the restaurant went through a makeover for the best. They ditched the faux store-front, upgraded the chef, and made the most out of the space.
Even though we’re here so often, we hadn't updated our review since all these changes for the better were made. So here we are to tell you that this place is still awesome. We love Jeffrey’s because the people are friendly, it’s easy to get in, and the food is great - especially the raw bar and the incredible clam chowder.

The space is unattached to the formal restaurant, though it has a similar feel: it’s elegant, it’s dark, and it’s the kind of place that makes you feel awesome. And for what it is - a bar that offers a full, expensive, menu full of casual(ish) food - it’s really damn good. Just know that this isn’t the “after work with your crew” bar. This is the once-in-a-while bar, best saved for those times you want to impress someone, or maybe just impress yourself a little bit.
Regardless of who you’re impressing, they should probably be someone that you’d also take to a nice dinner, because the NoMad bar will cost you about the same.

",4.0,French,Racines,7.8,"A few years ago, we were in Paris between Christmas and New Years. This is a
dead time in the city, when very few restaurants are open and most of the
locals are holed up in their apartments, probably rolling all their cigarettes
for the coming year or something. But it's also a cool time to be there,
because it forces you into the tiny corners of the neighborhoods to find good
food.
It also might make you find some other interesting things, which was true for
us when we found, on a random late December night, completely by accident, a
man named Pierre Jancou, manning a completely empty wine bar. We sat down
expecting to have a glass or two and somehow ended up having one of the
greatest nights ever, drinking wine, listening to music, and discussing food
with Pierre while he spontaneously cooked us pasta on a hot plate with
ingredients he happened to have on hand. What we hadn't known when we walked
in is that Pierre is something of a Parisian restaurant legend (who also
happened to own the wine bar and adjacent restaurant, Vivant). He's also very
good at pouring wine. I missed my Eurostar the next morning.
What made Pierre a legend, aside from the fact that he sort of looks like what
Jude Law might look like if Jude Law wasn't such a pussy, is
a restaurant he opened in 2008 called Racines. Racines is and was a tiny
little place in the 2nd, built on Pierre's passion for all natural wines (no
sulfur) and simple, local ingredients from small producers. Jancou sold
Racines a few years later, and along with it, the rights to use the name and
open a location in New York.
The reason I spent all of that time telling you that story, is because I think
it will help you appreciate this new Racines in Tribeca more. Pierre the
Parisian wine legend hasn't been involved with the place for some time, but
both restaurants still carry some of his philosophy, i.e. natural wines and
simple food. You'll want to drink at this new Racines, and you'll probably
want to drink a lot, because the wine list is excellent and surprisingly
affordable. You'll also want to eat, and the food at Racines New York is
impressive. It would be a mistake to assume that this is just another wine bar
in a neighborhood that definitely doesn't need another wine bar. This is one
of the better places to eat in Tribeca.
Aside from the food and the wine list, I think what impressed us the most
about Racines is how much the staff here care and also knows their sh*t, but
not in a stuffy way. It's just as good of a spot for a date as it is for a
laid back (albeit pricey) weeknight meal, especially if you elect to sit at
the chef's counter - which you should. The menu changes frequently and is
fairly upscale, but this is also a place you can roll into for a good glass of
wine and a hangar steak. Or, you can do what we did in Paris on that random
night, and try to drink every natural/organic bottle on the list in one
sitting. Just make sure you don't have a train to catch the next day."

Between Tanoshi Sushi and now Yefsi, we're gonna start lobbying the MTA for a York Avenue subway soon. It will run the entire 30 block stretch of York, cost roughly 17 billion dollars, and will be useful to only a very small percentage of the population, two decades from now. And that's exactly why it will probably get approved.
Until that day comes, you'll have to take a taxi all the way to the east side of the island to eat at Yefsi, but we think that's something you should do. At least, that is, assuming you get down with Greek food. We certainly do, and so do our Greek friends who introduced us to this place recently.
Yefsi is one of those Upper East Side restaurants that you usually walk by and wonder who eats there, assuming you notice it at all. It's a non-descript room that looks like it came out of the ""So You Want to Open an Upscale Restaurant"" handbook from ten years ago, meaning there are lots of wood finishes and halogen lights, and I'm pretty sure the host checked in my reservation on a Gateway. But what Yefsi lacks in aesthetic personality, it makes up for with excellent food. For all of the disappointing modern Greek restaurants that we've been to, Yefsi is one of the few to get it right. The food is predictably simple but still highly flavorful, the people are nice, and the prices are reasonable. Could you get more authentic Greek eats in Astoria? Absolutely. But we're betting there's a better chance you'll like your meal at Yefsi than you will at some of the more well known spots in Queens, and you'll certainly like it a lot more than most of the other restaurants in this neighborhood. That is, until the new York Avenue subway changes everything. Mark my words."

We, like pretty much everyone else, have always loved Mary's famous lobster roll and the restaurant's beach-shack-in-the-village vibe. But with age, Mary's has developed some flaws, so it's time for a re-review, to reset expectations.
The dishes Mary's is known for are still worth the hype. The aforementioned lobster roll is amazing, assuming you can get down with the mayo-heavy variety. The mussels are always fresh and delicious. We love the oyster Po' Boy, too.
But there are not so great things on this menu that we need to talk about -like the fish tacos. You could roll up some deep fried Montauk Monster into a taco and I'd probably eat it. But at Mary's, the only flavorful thing about their fish taco is the corn salad that comes on the side. Then there's the spicy and citrusy shrimp burger that falls apart like a misunderstood quinoa patty the second you take a bite. And over time, we've found the chalk board specials to be hit or miss. So, unless you spy something irresistible on a neighboring table, we recommend sticking to the main menu.
Beyond the food, we highly recommend avoiding Mary's for dinner. It is incredibly hectic with tables so close together, you'll be swimming in your neighbor's chowder before you even look at the menu. I selfishly think the drink list is great because Red Stripe is my favorite beer, but otherwise the options are very mediocre. And no matter how quickly you order and eat, you'll feel like both the hostess and wait staff hate you the entire time you're there. That is until they kick you out as soon as you ask for your check, at which point you will know for sure.
During the day, Mary's is significantly more relaxed, and is a better time to enjoy the atmosphere and food. That's when you should hit it. Plus, the lunch menu tends to have better options than dinner anyway.
Listen to your mother when she says nothing good happens after sundown, because when it comes to Mary's, she's right."

important for weekday breakfast meetings, and close at Midnight, which might
as well be 4AM in this part of town. They also have free wifi and some of the
cleanest, most private restaurant toilets you'll find in NYC, which is

The menu - Latin-American with some Mediterranean - sounds like a delicious combination of the best of both worlds. Even the space is awesome -a dimly-lit and well-decorated cave that sprawls back through a couple of rooms and a greenhouse, finally ending in a spacious garden decked out in string lights. Nobody doesn't love string lights.
So, what’s wrong with us? Why don’t we love you, Colonia Verde? Like my charming date who just wanted me to crash into him, everything on this menu presents very well, but most of it is insanely bland. I actually thought for a second that I must have blacked out before dinner and powered through a carton of Marlboro Reds, because I really couldn’t taste a thing I was eating. That's not what you want from Latin cuisine.
The good news/bad news here is that with a few tweaks to the food, Colonia Verde would be certifiably awesome. Basically, they need to throw in an extra handful of whatever flavors they’re showcasing in each dish, and then throw in a handful more. It just seems like they are holding themselves back on the seasoning, and for no good reason. Either way, we tried really hard to love this place, and we get what they’re trying to put out there. But while it’s not the most expensive restaurant out there, it’s also not the cheapest, and when you spend that kind of cash you expect a lot more. Thankfully, unlike that guy who didn’t work out, there is room for improvement. But until they step it up, Colonia Verde is just going to be an occasional hookup at best."

",2.0,Burgers,Umami Burger,3.8,"We’ve been holding this in for far too long - Umami burger sucks, quite often.
This is not one of those reviews where we go once and trash a place. We’ve been to Umami at least 10 times in about as many locations. It insinuates its way into our eating far too often.
Of those ~10 meals, about three of the burgers were good. We’ve seen all the ways they can go wrong - mealy meat, instantly liquified bun, bad toppings, and the basic crime of everything not tasting good together. The three burgers that were good were pretty darn good. But what is this, Little League? Does everyone get a trophy? Do I only have to pay three out of 10 times?
The fries and specialty sauces are similarly unreliable. Is the super-duper “umami ketchup” better than Heinz? Going to throw our lot in with Malcolm Gladwell and say no. We’ve even tried some of the “secret” off menu items, like the cheesy tater tots, and we got a sad pile of potatoes in solidified plasticky yellow goo. These would have been below par at our horrific college dining hall.
We’re tired of Umami. Go to In-N-Out. Go to Five Guys if relentless customization is your speed. This scourge slowly creeping across our landscape must be stopped.  "

review for
the original location, allow us to get you up to speed: We've got a lot of love for The Meatball Shop. Every once in a while, we forget why we like this place so much. But being that these things are f*cking everywhere now,
opportunities constantly present themselves to remind us of how reliable this restaurant is. The Meatball Shop's balls are pretty damn impressive, whether it be on a bun or naked for the world to see. We also like the fact that they bump hip hop through the speakers, serve homemade ice cream sandwiches, and take their beer and wine list more seriously than you might expect. This is basically the Italian Shake Shack. Or maybe it's the Uber of meatballs. Or Warby Parker for sandwiches. Jesus, we've been spending too much time in San Francisco.
Of all The Meatball Shop locations, Chelsea is our favorite. It's spacious, has a great private room downstairs for big group outings, and is open until 2AM. It's also in a neighborhood that's rich with quality humans, but not
necessarily quality restaurants. As a result, The Meatball Shop operates at capacity on most nights. Can't deal with the crowds? Try it for takeout. Either way, this is a good spot to have in your back pocket for the next time
you need an easy meal in the neighborhood."

",4.0,Pasta,Scarpetta,5.7,"There was a time when we were pretty impressed by Scarpetta. This was back when it was just a new-ish restaurant in the Meatpacking District with really good spaghetti and a three star review from the New York Times. This was also back when we were really impressed with ourselves for launching a website that 31 or so people cared about. So let's say it was a different era. What we wouldn't do to get some of those 31 people back.
In the time that's passed since our initial Scarpetta review (May 2009), a lot has changed for both of us. Scarpetta has gone on to open four additional locations in the US and Canada, and their chef/owner Scott Conant has taken up residence in the living room (and dreams) of every middle aged housewife from New Jersey to Nebraska via his role as a television food judge on the show Chopped. We here at The Infatuation have expanded to one new city and my cholesterol is much higher. So we'll call it a tie.
Unfortunately, only one of us is getting better with age, and here's a hint for you: It's me. Scarpetta is a much less impressive restaurant these days, with pretty bad service, pretty mediocre food, and a dining room full of people who may or may not think this is a Tyler Florence restaurant. Even that famous spaghetti dish has lost a bit of its luster. Meanwhile, I am slowly evolving into a Lebanese cross between George Clooney and this guy. Or at least that's what the birthday card I got myself says.
At the end of the day, there are certainly still some things worth eating on this Scarpetta menu, and there are certainly worse places to eat in the Meatpacking District - but that's not how we set the bar around here. If you want a sceney meal of pasta and wine, go to one of the 27 better options you have within walking distance. Or go back in time to when this place was in its heyday."

",2.0,Chinese,Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen,7.3,"We went into our eating experience at Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen understanding that the ramen wasn't going to be what we have come to know and love from the Ippudos and Slurp Shops of the world. We educated ourselves to know that the broth would be more subtle, and the hand-pulled noodles more central to the experience.
But just because we went in with an open mind and adjusted expectations doesn't mean we had to love the bowls in front of us. The noodles at Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen are excellent (almost as excellent as the name) but the broth and meat were just so...boring...that it was hard to fall in love with the ramen here, or even develop a nonsexual crush on it. Quite frankly, we wouldn't even swipe right on the new app that matches you up with various available soups in New York City (patent pending) if this stuff popped up on it.
Then again, that 7.3 rating you see on this review means that something had to have worked, and something did indeed. After the ramen was cleared away and our tears of disappointment dried up, our meal at Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen was actually really good. The other menu items - soup dumplings, scallion pancakes with beef, lo mein-style dishes - were fantastic. So much so that this place has jumped straight to the top of our Late Night Eats Hit List for Midtown, right up there with Sake Bar Hagi. There is, however, one caveat. For some reason, there are no alcoholic beverages available for purchase in the restaurant. So while we encourage you to show up after you've already had a few (as you should at any late night Chinese food session) don't expect to keep your buzz going once seated.
All in all, Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen is fairly straightforward. The dining room is pretty unremarkable, the turnover is fast, and the bathroom has random pairs of headphones hanging on the stall wall. Ok, so one part isn't so straightforward. To avoid springing these kinds of surprises on future customers, Kung Fu Mad Good Little Steamed Buns Mediocre Ramen Bizarre Bathroom Decor might be a more fitting name. We'll throw it in the suggestion box next time we're in."

",3.0,American,Extra Virgin,7.8,"As I was going through and re-writing our review for Extra Virgin from five years ago, something really stood out to me. For all we talk about in terms of our oldest reviews needing updating, there are some restaurants that simply don’t change. Extra Virgin is one of them. This place is still exactly the same as it was five years ago - the food is still really good, it’s still ideally suited for Date Night, and we’d still come here and dine solo at the bar any night of the week. I honestly could have left the original 2009 review for this place completely intact and simply changed the date, and everything would still be relevant to you today. Ok, maybe not that Adam Sandler reference I made, but definitely everything else.
I think what we appreciate most about Extra Virgin is its consistency. Is this the best restaurant in the West Village? No, it isn’t. Do they use too much butter in many of the dishes? If you believe such a thing is possible, then probably. But there’s something nice about knowing what you’re going to get when you walk into a place, even if you haven’t been there in two years. I know that when I walk into Extra Virgin on any given night that it will be packed but that I can likely find a seat at the bar, and that whatever I decide to eat, I’m going to enjoy it. Consistency is a beautiful thing.
Speaking of consistency, this restaurant still ranks near the top of our list for any situation in which you’re planning to have dinner with a someone that you’d like to do it with. And by “it” I mean eat some quality fish and talk about what books you both like.
What did you think I meant?"

If you've never been to Peacefood Cafe, this is probably new and confusing

exists. I will apologize for exactly one of those things.
For those not yet indoctrinated into the cult of Peacefood, let us get you up

“awareness of non-violence can be spread through feeding people with delicious
vegan food."" I have absolutely no idea what that means, but I will say that I
felt a warm rush of non-violence flow through my body when I found out that
they have nachos on this menu. Like, real, delicious nachos, with real chips
and absolutely no sign of ingredients that could also be used to make rope. I
also felt significantly less combative when I realized that almost all of the
vegan food in this place is quite tasty, though I will admit that I did not
eat any of the thing they call “un-chicken."" Just couldn't get there.

",2.0,Seafood,Petite Crevette,7.9,"Petite Crevette is why people ignore common sense (your studio with no dishwasher costs how much?) and refuse to live anywhere but New York. Petite Crevette is the type of place you could walk past a hundred times without noticing before finally popping in. Petite Crevette is one of those rare neighborhood spots that caters to area locals, without being pretentious or exclusive to outsiders. Petite Crevette is kind of just a fun name to say, and makes you appreciate what a gift Alex Trebek is to all of us.
Sitting on a less-than-picturesque block on Union and Hicks (mmm ya smell that? It’s the BQE), this is a local seafood gem with a seriously dedicated following. The dining room is small - it squeezes in maybe 20 bodies at a time
- and often crowded. But the two aren't necessarily related. There are plenty of cutesy, quaint places in this area, and few of them see the same kind of nightly turnover. The menu isn’t huge, but there are enough reliable fresh fish dishes that you can come back again and again without having to reorder the same thing. Yes, cash-only is annoying, but a BYOB policy with a very minimal corking fee ($5 last time we went in, and no charge the second time) makes up for it in a big way. Plus there's no need to schlep stuff in advance thanks to a bodega on the nearby corner for beer, and a wine shop around the way for a bottle.
Like any good local spot, Petite Crevette is full of character. The dining room looks like the owner went to a yard sale and just bought the entire lot, with an assortment of knickknacks placed at random. You know, put the mannequin down here, hang the bird clock over there, and just chuck that hub cap wherever. Oh, and the chef has been known to throw lobster at fussy customers who question the freshness of his product. Like we said, a neighborhood place full of character(s)."

",4.0,Italian,Peasant,7.7,"Peasant has always been an Infatuation standby - a place we turn to when we're in the need of something reliable in Nolita. That said, we turned to it a lot more before places like Rubirosa and Uncle Boons showed up in the neighborhood. Vodka sauce pizza and Thai coconut sundaes win out over sensible Italian food every time. So, after a few year hiatus, we decided it was time for a return visit, to see if Peasant is still as good as it used to be - and to see if anything on their menu could compete with those celebrity food items from the newer restaurants down the street.
After our recent trips to Peasant, here's what we can tell you: This place is more touristy and more parent-y than it used to be. Why? My initial guess was that it's listed at something like #3 on Trip Advisor for New York's best restaurants, but nope, that honor goes to Club A Steakhouse in Midtown East. Ever heard of it? Didn't think so. But there are a fuck ton of people form Arizona who think that's the THIRD BEST OF WHAT WE'VE GOT. Seems legit.
At any rate, we're not sure exactly what's driving all the tourist traffic into Peasant, and we don't really care either. The food here is still really good, especially if you know what to order and stick to the hits, which you can find in the Food Rundown below. We still like their subterranean wine room better than the main dining room on street level - just because it's a bit more vibey - but both spaces have a warm, rustic feel that will make you excited to eat some Italian food from a wood-burning oven. Peasant also has a solid, affordable wine list and a really nice staff that will take good care of you, regardless of where you or your parents are from. You'd think that would be enough to bump up their ranking on Trip Advisor, maybe unseating Kristalbelli for the #10 spot. Wait, what the f*ck is Kristalbelli? Excuse me while I go yell at things."

",4.0,French,La Sirène,7.4,"French food is hardly a novelty in New York, especially in Manhattan, but finding an un-fussy, un-pretentious joint absent throngs of girls-in-heels increasingly is. In such trying times, it’s important to remember those who came before the recent outbreak of trendy French restaurants and who continue to do it right. La Sirène has been open since 2008 and has expanded, changed, and created spin-offs, yet has managed to remain a cult favorite among those who have been eating there for years.
In its early days, La Sirène was a tiny BYOB restaurant in the southwestern no-man’s land of SoHo. Today, it has taken over an adjacent storefront and started serving wine and liquor, but the original charm remains, thanks to chef/owner, Didier Pawlicki, who came to New York from Provence. Didier is obsessed with internet feedback and puts commentary on his menu like, “This cassoulet is a Very Rich Dish which was served for Warriors to defend their Village! Don’t take it if you can’t bear it :)”. So, yeah, now you know that. The intimate and feisty atmosphere suffered a bit once they expanded, and their new wine list isn’t an improvement from their long-held BYOB policy, but overall, the vibe at La Sirène is still the same - it's charming and a little bit funky.
As for what to eat, the menu here is generally solid, minus a few misses. Sure, there is probably better French food in NYC, but La Sirène is pretty damn good and pretty damn authentic. Imagine walking into an undiscovered bistro somewhere in Provence, and having a, “THIS IS FRANCE” moment. You can have that moment here too, as long as you can block out the actual tunnel vision right outside the window and focus on appreciating the classic French flavors instead. Plus, sometimes you just want a hyperactive and passionate Provençal man to serve you the best profiteroles you’ve ever had in a strange corner of Manhattan, and you want to avoid banker bros while doing so. This is your place."

",1.0,Latin,Café Habana,8.2,"Everything we said about Café Habana back in our 2009 review remains true, which is kind of amazing considering how quickly the restaurant landscape of this city changes these days. It’s still one of the coolest restaurants in NYC, it’s still delicious, it’s still cheap, and crack is still the special ingredient to the corn. Café Habana is a special place, as important to the culture of downtown New York as any establishment. It’s the corner diner that never goes out of style, where customers will gladly wait outside for 45 minutes, people watching until their table is ready. Everyone knows the drill, and no one complains. And if things happen to be a little too crazy, Habana-To-Go is situated right next door, with mostly the same menu, perfectly packed to-go.
Our favorite time to come to Café Habana will always be weekday breakfast or weekday dinner, when you can actually get in here without waiting, and when it’s more of a locals’ hang than during prime time. It’s useful for any meal, any time of the day, whether you need a cuban, a Corona, or a big plate of $9 huevos rancheros. People cram themselves into the tiniest spaces, literally sitting on top of strangers next to them. Comfort is not something Café Habana achieves in the traditional sense - it’s something they achieve through their food."

Just in case you were wondering, this is still probably the burger we’d most like to eat at any given time in New York City, and the only thing that keeps us from having one weekly is the near constant line and our desire to avoid a Lipitor dependency.Actually, these days the lines at Burger Joint can be pretty manageable, especially if you go at off-peak hours. If you’re wandering through Midtown at 3pm, you can usually roll right in unimpeded. Noon on a Thursday is a different story.
Regardless of what time you go or how long you have to wait for your hot handful of beef and bun and American glory, Burger Joint is always a smart move. It will forever have a place in The Infatuation Hall of Fame and should also be added to the short list of dining establishments that every visitor to this city must experience before being allowed out of Midtown.

",3.0,American,Root & Bone,8.1,"Y’all. I’ve spent some quality time with Root & Bone. And as a proud child of a summer camp in the Blue Ridge Mountains and Wake Forest University in tobacco country, I feel morally obligated to proclaim: THIS is what the Southern cookin’ and eatin’ experience is supposed to look like.
First of all, if you’ve been to Elsa (RIP), The Cardinal, or both, Root & Bone captures the perfect cross between those two awesome East Village joints. Laid back and small, yet classy. Reasonably priced and casual, yet impressive in delivery.
But most importantly, the food is excellent. For example, the Southern Greens Caesar salad is like a regular caesar salad that went to Buddha school, achieved Nirvana, then came back and decided we were worthy of enlightenment. Even the things at this new restaurant that aren’t perfect - like the cheddar waffles - are so good that we ate them like they were free. Meaning quickly and with gusto.
Then there’s the fried chicken basket. It will stay with me forever. On my hips and in my heart. There’s so much to say, but in short, f*ck locally sourced chickens. The only chickens I ever want to spend time with from here on out must come from the South and have been bathed in sweet tea since hatch. And with that glorious chicken comes a sauce that I firmly believe is the elixir of life disguised as a condiment. As soon as I discovered it, it was all I could taste, see or want. It’s hot sauce meets honey meets... that’s about when I blacked out.
Of course, Root & Bone is still quite new. So it’s no surprise that we found one slight flaw. You see, I consider myself a mac and cheese connoisseur and was a bit disappointed in what Root & Bone brought to the table on that front. It reminded me a lot of the stuff I used to get at summer camp, which was great because the cheese was kind of grainy, and it efficiently carbo-loaded you for post-dinner capture-the-flag. But at a restaurant where everything else is on another level, I expected more.
So with a few growing pains on the menu and an incredibly long wait, Root and Bone is by no means perfect. But it has all of the fundamentals it needs to become a consistently awesome must-hit for the East Village in the very near future. Until then, I’ll just be sitting on their stoop, googling how much fried chicken you can eat before developing gout and pondering the religiopolitical implications of whiskey maple syrup."

I fully appreciate how delicious canned cherry tomatoes are, but just because they aren't sold at the Key Foods next door doesn't mean you can charge me $5 for them. So when you walk into Court Street Grocers' small entryway, mind the shelves of pricey mustard and horseradish mayonnaise. They are perfectly legitimate items, they're just not the reason you came here. For now, head toward the back deli counter. That is where the pricey items worth ponying up for reside.
Court Street Grocers, with its main shop situated in Carroll Gardens, is the best sandwich shop you've never been to. Or have been to and are taking waaaay too long to return. At $9-$12, the prices here aren't crazy, even though that money isn't going to land you the massive, size-of-your-torso hero you might expect for $12 worth of turkey. But with a chalkboard this full of hits, who cares. Plus, the guys and gals who work here are crazy nice and seem intent on making sure you love whatever sandwich you are about to inhale, whether you take it to eat on the go or enjoy it at one of the side room tables like a human.
To ensure every customer leaves happy, CSG focuses on the two main components of any baller sandwich - the bread, and the meat. Rather than using any old slice, the breads here are sourced from an All Star cast of bakeries around the city, with heavy hitters like Balthazar for French bread and the local Caputo's for its seeded hoagie rolls. For meat, this place house-cures and/or hand-slices just about everything on the menu. So nobody will fault you if you roll through on a weekend and order for the upcoming work week.

If someone were to ask us to put together a list (people love lists) of once-in-a-lifetime meals that we’d like to eat many, many times in our lifetimes, the tasting menu at this legendary restaurant would be near the top. There aren’t many better fine dining experiences in this city - or even the world - especially when it comes to service and atmosphere.
But I didn’t just spend a day updating our original review from 2010 to tell you something you already know. The Infatuation saying that Gramercy Tavern is good probably isn’t going to be the breaking news for the day on the new 24-hour food news channel from Rupert Murdoch and Paula Deen (you laugh, but it could happen). I’m here instead to tell you that you aren’t eating at the Gramercy Tavern bar enough.
For those of you who are not already aware/frequenting it weekly, Gramercy Tavern not only has a great bar, but the bar is essentially a whole different restaurant. A beautiful, more casual restaurant with an a la carte menu and insanely good food. As a matter of fact, we haven’t had a meal in the main dining room here since sometime in 2012, but we’ve hit the bar a dozen times since then. You’ll find the same level of service, the same quality of food, and a much more relaxed atmosphere than what goes on in the big boy room.
Now that I think about it, since I’ve done the once-in-a-lifetime meal at Gramercy Tavern twice already, I might not need to do it again. But I’ll come for bowl of pasta and a beer until the day I die."

It’s safe to say an update was necessary.The good news is that even though the review was old, we were still absolutely right about this place. A couple of recent return trips to Casa Mono has proven that this restaurant is just as good as it’s ever been. It’s a timeless NYC classic with an unmistakable feel-good vibe and top notch but relaxed service. As for the food, you’d be hard pressed to find Spanish food in the United States better than those coming out of this tiny Gramercy kitchen. You can pretty much close your eyes and blindly point at the menu, comfortably knowing there’s no wrong answer.
Want to impress an out-of-towner? How about a first date? Take them to Casa Mono. Don’t have a reservation? Don’t worry about it. All you need to do is show up and prepare to kick it next door at Bar Jamón, Casa Mono’s wine and tapas bar, while you wait for your table.

I actually used to live pretty close to this new Sticky's storefront, back when a basket of guacamole covered buffalo chicken fingers was exactly the thing I was looking for at 2am. In my day, we didn't have anything like Sticky's to actually deliver on that desire, so my version of Late Night Eats would be stumbling into a bodega, ordering a reuben, eating it on my couch, and then going directly to sleep. So, yeah, I'd say I was in pretty good shape back then.
You don't need to be a drunk kid or an economics major to see why Sticky's is going to do well in this part of town, or why it's done so well in the Village. But it's important to understand that their equation for success is more than just (something from a deep fryer + sauce + hammered 22 year old) = pay me. The food here is actually really high quality, really good, and really creative. The chicken is super crunchy on the outside and incredibly juicy on the inside. The sh*t they put on top of it is very unique and (mostly) very delicious. They also happen to be pretty good at marketing, because I can't think of any other reason to explain the existence of S'mores fries. Then again, what do I know?

",3.0,Raw Bar,Grand Banks,7.1,"New York City's floating restaurant situation is improving, thanks to two new boats serving food and bobbing in the Hudson River, the North River Lobster Co. and the fine vessel you see here, Grand Banks. Here's one thing we've learned this summer - people get really excited about boats. I'm not sure this island has had so much interest around the arrival of a sea craft since the Dutch showed up in 1665 and established the city's first Le Pain Quotidien.
Speaking of settlers, Grand Banks is captained by an explorer in his own right, Mark Firth, who, according to the boat's website is a ""pioneer of the Brooklyn food renaissance."" Mark was one of the founders of the much beloved group of restaurants that include Diner and Marlow and Sons. His conquest of Williamsburg is a significant one, and our lives are all better today because of it. I can't wait to see what he does with Tribeca. Hopefully he treats the natives humanely.
We recently visited Grand Banks to meet our new future ruler and eat the oysters he has brought with him from wherever this boat originated. Our first impression was that Grand Banks isn't really a restaurant. It's more of a skiff with booze and raw seafood on it. It's also much smaller than what we expected to find after all that fanfare, sort of like if the Queen Mary just ended up being a nicely appointed tug boat. I guess we were just expecting something bigger.
Either way, Grand Banks is a fun little spot with really good oysters and other small plates, and some good drinks to match. The crew are really nice and the views are beautiful, which is probably why you come to eat things on a boat tied up to a pier, rather than a restaurant on land. However, now that we've seen it, I can't say that we feel the need to come back. There are lots of other places to get oysters in this town, and we get motion sick easy. I guess we just weren't cut out for life at sea."

",3.0,Seafood,North River Lobster Co.,6.8,"Despite being surrounded by (dirty, dirty) water, Manhattan doesn't have much in the way of boardwalks or the kind of no frills seafood restaurants that normally populate them. Well, now we have one. North River Lobster Co. opened up this summer at Pier 81 - on a boat, on the water, in Manhattan - right below 42nd Street on the West Side. Even though it's in the middle of fart-tastic touristville, we applaud the effort here. Honestly, the last time I was on a boat in Manhattan I was seven, it was the Intrepid, and I was crying because I was scared. What a p*ssy.
Here's what you need to know about North River Lobster Co. As we discussed, it's on a boat, and no, you can't hashtag that anymore. It's over. It's done. It's played out. Stop. The boat docks at Pier 81 and is there from 12:30pm-10pm daily, and then sets ""sail"" for a quick half hour tour of the Hudson at designated times throughout the day. The crowd is what you'd expect from the location - more fanny packs than fedoras. There are numerous seating situation, both indoors and out. Order on the second floor, grab a table in one of numerous indoor or outdoor seating situations, and then wait for your light-up lobster to blink and vibrate. Then prepare to enjoy numbingly average seafood. The shrimp po boy is mostly bread, the lobster roll is just sort of there, and their oyster prep needs help. That's OK though, we don't need the food on this boat to be awesome. Just drive us around on the water."

",3.0,Chinese,Decoy,7.9,"A while back, we took at stab at predicting the future, as we've been known to do from time to time when it comes to upcoming trends in food. Just call us EEEEEATStradamus. In this particular instance of clairvoyance, we were sure that Peking duck would become the hot food item of the moment, pointing to a few factors, including the news that the team behind Red Farm would open Decoy, a restaurant dedicated entirely to Peking duck dinners.
Well, it's been a year since we made that statement, Decoy is open and serving diners, and WHAT THE F*CK PEOPLE? Nothing. There's been no frenzy of social media, no long form pieces of journalism on the history of the food's origin, and I haven't seen a thing from Eddie Huang about how he can make a better Peking duck than anyone in this town except he's not gonna. I guess I'm just a little bit disappointed.
Despite my inability to stir up hysteria like the Farmer's Almanac does when it predicts the weather, I am happy about one thing - Decoy is really good. The entire concept of this restaurant is simple, and that's the best part. You order a Peking duck dinner, you get the bird along with an absolutely absurd amount of other food, you eat, you go home happy. We actually like this place better than Red Farm, because they play the duck straight. It doesn't come stuffed with Katz' pastrami, nor is it made to look like Pac Man or a Ninja Turtle. It's just very good and very familiar. Like it should be.
The only problem with Decoy relates to the price. The standard Peking Duck Dinner will set you back $65 per person, and while it does come with an incredible amount of food, that's a whole lot more than you'll spend on a similar meal in Chinatown or the Upper East Side. Then again, this is West Village, and this is the restaurant group that's best known for serving dumplings to celebrities and having $5,000 Japanese toilets in the bathroom. What did you expect? Here's one thing I can predict, people are going to eat here regardless. Now I just have to figure out how to get them to become unreasonably excited about it."

First it was from much of the New York food media, declaring this little bakery by day/restaurant by night one of the better things to open in 2013. Then it was from friends who live near Gowanus (nobody lives in Gowanus), swearing by their baked goods, coffee, and lunch. After that it was from a few other vocal individuals, telling us that the place is completely overhyped, even going so far as to use the word ""garbaggio."" Eventually, we decided to see for ourselves, because all of these people can't be right at the same time. Here's where we stand.
First things first, Runner & Stone is not a destination restaurant. If you don't live nearby, you don't need to make a weekend trek into Brooklyn just to check this place out, unless you also happen to be dying to see what a brand new Whole Foods or a toxic river beautiful canal looks like. Second, no matter where you live, you shouldn't be coming to Runner & Stone for the Brooklyn dinner of your dreams. There are way too many other places that will better serve that purpose, many of them in close proximity. Really, what you want to be coming to Runner & Stone for is a decent meal from a neighborhood restaurant. The people here are friendly, it's generally pretty good for dinner, it's great for a weekday lunch or weekend brunch, and the baked goods will blow your tits off. Just try eating one of their chocolate almond croissants and tell me you aren't permanently affected.
I guess what we're trying to say is that regardless of what you've heard, Runner & Stone is really just that one reliable place that opens up in a neighborhood that desperately needs something reliable, then and everyone that lives there goes ""fcking finally."" They do a few things really well, and honestly, that's enough. But somewhere along the line, ""fcking finally"" turned into, ""EVERYBODY EAT HERE IMMEDIATELY"" and that's when things got confusing. Good thing you have us to help you sort it out."

",4.0,American,Marc Forgione,8.2,"I'll be the first to admit it when I'm wrong, as it happens a lot. For
example, when we first put @infatuation on Instagram, I was convinced the platform was supposed to be used as a history of our travels, and argued with Stang that photos like
this were completely
acceptable. That one's embarrassing. Another thing I was wrong about: Marc
Forgione. Of all the reviews we've written (over 800) in the last five years,
one of the ones that we've had the most disagreement on is Marc Forgione. Back in 2010, we gave it a lukewarm 6.8. Not a slam by any stretch of the
imagination, but not a stamp of approval either.
We had two main problems the first time around. First off, there was a
terrible cover band playing U2 songs inside the restaurant while we were
attempting to eat an expensive meal. Talk about killing a vibe...jesus.
Someone once emailed me that they thought that my comments about the live music led them to believe I was discriminating against Forgione himself because he had a mohawk and a ""rocker"" look. Little did they know I grew up a
wanna-be suburban punk, and Rancid remains one of my favorite bands of all time. But a) U2 sucks, and b) the only time a U2 cover band is acceptable during dinner is at the wedding of some other dude who plays in a U2 cover band. Period.
As for the food, we just didn't initially love it. Everything sounded awesome
on paper and looked beautiful on the plate, but didn't really deliver once we
got around to eating it. Hence the mediocre rating.
It would seem, however, that things at Marc Forgione have changed for the
best. That, and I was probably just wrong in the first place. We've been back
a few times over the last year or so, and the restaurant really seems to have
found its stride. The food is excellent, the service is good, and the upscale,
rustic room has always been one of our favorites in NYC. Marc Forgione is
Perfect For those times when you want to throw down on a baller meal and not
think twice about the bill, or go out for a Special Occasion dinner that's not quite as expensive as the other big boys, but also doesn't feel as stuffy.
So now that we've given Marc Forgione its rightful 8.2, please stop telling me
I'm wrong. About this at least. I'm not budging on the U2 thing."

Tavern On The Green 2.0 has been absolutely destroyed by the New York media, and although part of us didn't want to get involved, our experiences were so painful that they had to be shared. Don't just take it from me, let's check in with my fellow diners, old school Zagat style, and create a consensus.
""Andrew, dear, did you look up who the chef at this restaurant is yet? They must not be qualified. I should teach them my brisket recipe."" - Grandma
""Aside from the fact that there was a live worm in my salad - it was way too salty and completely inedible. A green salad."" - My Wife
""It was simply awful. My chicken was green, and looked diseased."" - Uncle David
""I would have loved it to be better. Is that OK? I want to give it a positive spin, I don't like being negative."" - Mom
""It was fine. I got scallops on bread, which was weird, and tiny and some other thing that was small. I was starving afterwards and got Chinese food."" - 17 Yr Old Cousin Charlotte
""It reminded me of the cruise we took to Northeast Canada."" - My Brother
""I asked to switch the bread on the sandwich and the waiter snarled at me. I wanted to snarl back when they gave me a very cold, very sad turkey club."" - Ariel Feldman
""They took cat food, slopped it on a plate, put pepper on it and called it tuna salad."" - Ariel's Mom
""My pasta might have been good except for the fact that it was drowning in burnt ricotta, which tasted like campfire marshmallow, but not in a good way."" - My Wife
""There's an expectation level that comes along with Tavern On The Green from an overall service perspective, and they don't come close to it. They limped along all night, and it's clearly a restaurant that wasn't ready to be open. I'll never come back here, which is sad."" - Grandma
So, yeah, the consensus seems to be, don't come here, unless you're someone who likes terrible food. Oh, and three weeks after Governor's Ball, our server was still wearing his VIP wristband. He was a nice guy and all, but come on man. It's time to take that thing off."

You’re a beer geek and you live somewhere near/under the 59th Street Bridge. 2. You stumbled upon it as you were desperately trying to escape Bed Bath & Beyond, running in any direction that promised the fastest route to freedom. 3. You saw it in our 2014 Summer Guide. Otherwise, this is probably the first time you’re hearing about this little gem located under the Roosevelt Island Tram.
The thing is, once you do make it into The Jeffrey, and regardless of the circumstances that brought you to it, you’ll be coming back. This place is easily the best bar in 20 blocks in any direction, and they also happen to have a great food menu and a big backyard beer garden. We have found ourselves visiting The Jeffrey whenever we’re in need of something Midtown or Upper East Side with outdoor seating, or when we’re looking for a spot to watch a game. The sandwiches and bar food bites are solid, the atmosphere is laid back, the beer list is huge, and the staff is friendly.
I think what we like most about The Jeffrey, though, is that there’s another layer beyond all of those things I just mentioned. In addition to the beer and the beer garden and the nice TV situation, there’s also an interesting little espresso bar and cocktail “lab” on one side of the space. This area has its own separate entrance, and is presided over by a man they call “The Bearded Alchemist.” As you can probably imagine, The Bearded Alchemist is awesome, and he makes excellent drinks, often incorporating unique ingredients like homemade ginger beer and mole bitters. During the daylight hours, this section of the bar also offers high quality coffee and growlers of beer to-go. The fact that those things are even available to you in this neighborhood make The Jeffrey unique and are also a testament to the fact that it’s much more than just a beer garden - it’s an escape. Just plan your getaway wisely. They designed that Bed Bath & Beyond so that it’s nearly impossible to get out. Like a prison. With Swiffers."

Brutal, we know, and probably the toughest decision you’ll have to make all day, other than whether or not to shower in the morning. You should shower by the way, the unlucky human stuffed inside your armpit on the rush hour L-Train will certainly appreciate it.
Momofuku Noodle Bar probably drives ramen purists crazy. It’s the ramen equivalent of going to Disney World, with Chang’s massive bowl of Momo Ramen starring as the giant turkey leg, smiling at the camera, ready to be photographed. Authentic or not, we don’t care. We fucking love this place. We love the massive photo of The Band on the wall. We love the playlists - everything from Atmosphere to Wu-Tang to Hall & Oates. We love the energy. We love being comfortably uncomfortable in the stools. We love that our water glass never gets past half empty before being filled. And most of all, we love the f*cking food.
Like Ssäm, Noodle is not for everyone (i.e. haters of salt), but Noodle Bar’s ramen is indeed excellent. Yes, yes, yes, and yes to Ippudo, Totto, Ivan, Rai Rai Ken and whatever other ramen you want to challenge with - they’re all awesome too. You know why? Because RAMEN IS DELICIOUS. However, ramen isn’t the only reason to come. You can have a great meal and not even order noodles. The ever-changing menu of meat, fish, and vegetable options are always stacked, sometimes with more exciting listings than what you’ll find over at Ssäm. Plus, staples like the steamed buns, soy sauce egg, and chicken wings never leave, which is good because we order those things every damn time.
So, which Momofuku should you go to tonight? We’ll leave that decision up to you. The good news is that there is no wrong answer."

",1.0,Diner,La Bonbonniere,7.7,"The West Village. Home of The Brunch. A meal that involves dressing up in your fanciest casual outfit and paying a minimum of $9 for a mimosa. It has its place in our society, and we are not here to knock it. Brunch has been good to us, many times over. But sometimes, we don't want brunch. Sometimes we want breakfast at noon. There is a difference. And in the West Village, with 12 new brunch spots opening every week, breakfast places have become harder to find.
But that's why you're friends with us.
La Bonbonniere is a Village safe haven from all things hollandaise. The cash-only menu is filled with standard breakfast staples, without any meddling whatsoever. Eggs. Omelets. French toast. Pancakes. Muffins. Bottomless cups of pretty mediocre coffee. Like we said, breakfast, not brunch. That isn't meant to suggest that this diner is a dump. Although, it kind of is. But the food speaks for itself and is good enough to attract crowds - weekend lines here are the norm, not the exception. Instead of giving your number to a hostess (there is none) and her calling you back when your table is ready (this place has a pay phone on the wall), BonBon has the eloquent system of making you stand in the cramped dining room while you wait your turn. Spend that time browsing the randomly hung photos and magazine clippings. Aside from a lot of Molly Shannon and Machu Picchu, we dare you to figure out the theme of Bon's decor.
Best yet, because we are here for breakfast, and not brunch, the food is served seconds after it is ordered. And at this place, we really mean seconds. They must be working with some illegally rigged, souped-up grill because there is no way they can feed people as quickly as they do working with a regulation model. But on the flip, the waiters here don't rush you, and nobody who works here will give you the stink eye for lingering over a check. So come hungry, eat quickly, and sit until the hungover guy waiting for your table is just too sad a sight to ignore."

But Five Leaves has been a hipster hangout since the moment it opened in 2008,
and it remains so, even despite the fact that there are now endless nearby
options for people who want to look good at a dinner table and also maybe eat
something.
The initial Infatuation review of Five Leaves came very late in the game - at
least according to current internet judgment protocol. Our first visits came
in late 2011, and by the time we'd had a few meals here, we had firmly decided
that it wasn't deserving of all the hype. It was too uncomfortable, too
inconsistent, and too full of people that spent a good part of their morning
rolling up the sleeves on their t-shirt.
Fast forward to present day, and we've been back to Five Leaves a few more
times, just to see what's shaking. We still don't love the food as much as
some people seem to, and it can still be very cramped and crowded. But we will
say that the consistency has improved - a lot. Brunch is and always has been
the best time of day to eat here, but dinner can be a good move too, assuming
you know what to order and most importantly - that you can be patient with the
scene around you. Then again, I'm writing this from the perspective of someone
who is more interested in the eating that goes at Five Points than in the
hanging out that goes on at Five Points. If you're 23, just got a job at Condé
Nast, and have yet to taste a truffle fry, bump up this rating considerably.

His steak tartare is cool, and his oyster sliders are OK, but it’s his pasta that we crave. We also like that Bar Primi is an approachable and easygoing place that you can generally get into. They don’t take reservations, but tables move quickly, and if there’s a wait, you can always go to The Bowery Hotel or The Wren for a drink nearby. Our overall experiences at Bar Primi have been great, as has most of the food - you just need to be careful as some items can be hit or miss.
On our first trip to Bar Primi, we aced the menu and thought this place was en route to a review in the mid 8′s. But on our subsequent trips, we didn’t have the same luck. Some of the pastas simply aren’t that good, and being that this place is all about the pasta, that’s a bummer. That being said, there are a few dishes - mainly the Bucatini with Slow Cooked Lamb and the Fiore di Carciofi - are completely out of this world. The daily specials are awesome, too, so make sure you order one of the large plates. The Thursday Night Lamb Chop. My God.If you order right, an excellent meal at Bar Primi is most certainly attainable. Strategy not only comes into play when approaching the menu, but also when deciding when to come, who to come with, and where to sit. Come early to give you the best shot at a good table. Try to lock down one of the comfy round booths upstairs - those are the best seats in the house. And come with four or five friends, as Bar Primi is ideal with a group."

Now, your first reaction to this news is probably something along the lines of, ""hang on while I make a note of this restaurant that I'll never go to."" And we don't blame you. We actually found out that he owned Bar San Miguel after our visit, and had we known beforehand, we probably would have written it off as a place where people yell at you in Spanish and scrutinize your menu selections in front of the entire restaurant. But that's not what goes on here at all.
Bar San Miguel is actually a really chill, really good little Mexican spot, with excellent margaritas and an awesome back patio. Do they serve the best Mexican food in New York City? No they don't, and by the way there's no such thing. But they do have a solid menu of enchiladas and tacos that more than get the job done, especially when you're chasing them with jalapeño-infused tequila drinks. The service is friendly too, and Bar San Miguel ultimately just has the vibe of a good neighborhood establishment - one where you come to have some drinks and see some friends, and maybe contemplate your investment strategy.

I think Jesus said it.
It's a useful bit of wisdom, but we'd like to add one thing, based on our own
life experiences: Also never discuss New York pizza. There is hardly a better
way to turn a friend into an enemy in this town than to disagree with them
about who has the best slice or pie, and lord forgive you if you start that
conversation without having been to DiFara.
So as you might expect, we are not here to tell you that Motorino has the best
pizza in New York. We've learned our lesson by now. But we would like to tell
you that Motorino is absolutely incredible, and it is by far our most
frequented pizza joint in the city. It's much easier to get to than the old
school favorites in Brooklyn, and it's also much easier to get a seat. And
when the craving hits for Motorino's perfectly chewy, perfectly charred, puffy
crust, the last thing you want to do is wait two hours for it.
That's not to say that you won't wait at Motorino - we're definitely not the
only ones that have such fond feelings for this place. But you can give the
host your name and phone number and head down the street for a drink until
your table is ready. If that doesn't work for you, Motorino also delivers
well. Find a friend who lives nearby and invite yourself over for dinner. Just

What has changed is our ability to write restaurant reviews that don't read like a second grader's homework assignment about a grocery store.
Gemma has never been in our annual Summer Guide, but few restaurants in NYC turn up for the warm weather quite like this one. This Italian restaurant in The Bowery Hotel features dirty sidewalk dining at its finest. On a nice afternoon, people are stacked three tables deep, with hangers on crowding the space between the tables and the curb, making it pretty much impossible to walk by. Basically, this is a See And Be Seen haven for people who care more about what's on their feet that night than what's going in their mouth.
The thing is, Gemma doesn't suck like it should. Sure, it's a tad expensive, but the food is consistently somewhere between above average and solid.

They’re the “Get Busy” era Sean Paul of restaurants, remixed by Major Lazer for 2014 with perfect branding and social media presence. Miss Lily’s has built an accessible brand of juice, jerk chicken, and rum punch that’s fun for the whole family, assuming your family is made up entirely of Instagram-obsessed urban skateboarders. They jack the reggae-electro beats high and cover the walls with colorful old vinyl and Jamaican concert posters. The room itself brings back memories of that one drug dealer’s lair from college, minus the black lights and lava lamps.

",4.0,Sandwiches,Via Quadronno,7.9,"A few years ago, we filed a review of Via Quadronno that basically outlined why you will love the sandwiches here, but pretty much hate the experience. It has historically been a very expensive, very uncomfortable place to eat. That, however, hasn’t stopped us from coming here out of necessity quite often, before or after we hit Central Park for various activities (roller skate dancing).
It seems that over time, Via Quadronno has gotten better. That, or I am just getting older and therefore more sympathetic to other cranky old people. One of our main complaints has always been the service - the people that worked here just always seemed angry that you wanted to eat their food. But those people seem to have been phased out in favor of more reasonable human beings that better handle the pressure of serving sandwiches to Europeans and crusty Upper East Siders. The last five or so times we have been by have been shockingly pleasant, even despite the crowds and cramped quarters.
The food at Via Quadronno has always been good, so nothing has changed on that front. It’s also stupid expensive, to the tune of lunch for two setting you back $50 no matter what. That said, when it comes to quality, you won’t find much that beats it on this side of Park Avenue. The panini are incredible, the pasta dishes are really good, and even simple stuff like vegetable soup or chilled asparagus salad are excellent. They also do a great cappuccino and have a little gelato stand in front. How Italian.
Ultimately, Via Quadronno should be on your list if you happen to be hitting the park or one of the nearby museums and need to eat some food. And if you don’t want to take your chances with the service or the crowds, just order to-go and eat outside somewhere nearby.

",3.0,Fusion,Indochine,7.3,"Is complaining about Fashion Week your favorite activity during Fashion Week? Are you a young, vaguely employed man with long hair? Could you identify Marc Jacobs by his tattoos, should the opportunity present itself? If so, then you’ve probably been to Indochine. And you’ve probably been here with a group of other people just like you.
You have also probably been to Indochine if you’re over the age of 40, considering that this place has in business for nearly three decades. And somehow despite its age, this restaurant has managed to stay relevant, at least amongst a certain crowd - the fashion crowd. A visit to Indochine on any given night is pretty much like walking into a cartoon rendering of a New York fashion blogger’s wet dream. It’s a funky, dated room full of very stylish people doing lots of things other than eating, many of whom are famous in their industry. Almost all are completely unrecognizable to someone like me. I’m pretty sure I did see one of the Blue Man Group here one time though. We all have our idols.
For what it is, we happen to like Indochine a lot. This is one of those places where you simply know what you’re going to get, every single time. The scene is more interesting than the somewhat average Pan-Asian food, but eating the city’s best spicy shrimp probably isn’t why you came here in the first place. If it is, you’re doing it wrong. Indochine is the place you come for a big group outing, especially of the birthday dinner variety. If you’re looking for a restaurant that can serve a table of ten equal parts food and vodka soda in high volume, this is your spot. The service is speedy, the room is loud and fun, and the menu is full of things that are perfectly good enough. If that doesn’t sound like a place to honor your best friend, I don’t know what does. Especially if he or she knows what Carine Roitfeld looks like."

",2.0,Diner,Russ & Daughters Cafe,8.2,"Historically, the most annoying aspect of Russ & Daughters, aside from the fact that it's pretty much always a zoo, has been the lack of seating. Sinking your teeth into a ""Pastrami Russ"" on a dirty Houston Street bench, inhaling bus fumes and listening to the sweet sounds of never ending construction has never felt right. But things are different now.
For their 100 year anniversary - yes, they opened in f*cking 1914 - Russ & Daughters has finally decided to expand and open Russ & Daughters Cafe, a place where one can finally enjoy all of their classic ""appetizing"" delights from the comfort of a cushy booth. They've done a fantastic job with the space, giving it the full retro diner look, while also staying true to the original R&D; vibe. The menu has expanded too, as this is heeb-tastic diner food at its very best. They serve breakfast all day, including eggs, bagels, smoked fish, matzoh ball soup, and all kinds of Jewish comfort food. All the classic bagel sandwiches come laid out on photogenic wood boards, which you've no doubt seen in your Instagram feed.
Russ & Daughters has always been equal parts #EEEEEATS and experience, and that remains true at the Cafe. They've done a great job of bottling up the energy of a classic New York experience, and transporting it down the block to a new location.
So congrats on 100 years and one new location, Russ & Daughters. If I live that long, please deliver me the biggest smoked fish platter you've got, and 500 grams of the Osetra Gueldenstaedtii caviar please. That's on the menu for $1,970.00, just in case you were wondering. Sounds like a good way to get all meshugena at an old age."

",3.0,Russian,Tatiana Restaurant & Nightclub,7.5,"There are so many angles for an opening gambit to a review of Brighton Beach's famed Tatiana Restaurant & Night Club. We could go with the fact that for most New Yorkers, ""dinner and a show"" means a semi-overpriced Italian joint and a revival musical somewhere in the West 40s, not a Russian banquet, fire throwing, and line dancing. Or we could talk about how a meal at Tatiana is akin to a blind taste test, given that you can't reeeally see what you are eating about 80% of the time that a dish is served. Or we could discuss how the Wall of Fame down by the bathrooms has over 40 framed pictures, and that we can name all of two of the famous people being celebrated - Oksana Baiul and that guy from one of those movies...we think.
So to avoid having to make a choice, let's just go with all of the above. Tatiana is a complete sh*t show and one of the most bizarrely entertaining nights you will find in a town full of bizarrely entertaining options. Bordering a stretch of the boardwalk, Tatiana's outdoor seating spills out onto the strip. But the main event takes place inside, where your meal is accompanied by a very home-cooked show featuring dancers, singers, ""trapeze"" artists, and a shirtless 40-year old who pops up during a few different acts. How many dinners have you been to that ended with a light show and unison clapping from the entire dining room? We thought so.
And then there is the food. The grub essentially serves the purpose of letting you drink without getting the spins. With that in mind, you can come and order a la carte, but this place is known for its banquet style meals from Friday-Sunday. You'll need numbers for this option, so round up your closest and least judgmental friends. Here's a litmus test: Anybody who is embarrassed at karaoke is out; anybody who runs to the center of the wedding dance floor to lift the bride on a chair despite being a +1 and not knowing anybody there is IN. Head for Little Russia, and prepare to sit back and be served platter after platter, worrying less about the menu and more about the women dancing inside giant picture frames.
Major Pro Tip: This place is not BYOB but the waiters have been known to let a few outside bottles slide. That said, if you're rolling deep, you may be able to make arrangements with the reservationist ahead of time to bring in your own. If not, sweet talk your waiter when you arrive and, assuming you are successful in your pitch, pop around the corner to the nearby liquor store. Regardless of what you normally drink with dinner, might we suggest that vodka helps the entire Tatiana experience go down more smoothly."

",1.0,Pizza,L&B Spumoni Gardens,8.1,"A pizza and ice cream party. Every kindergartner’s favorite. Getting older means we are expected to attend more grown up celebrations (black tie weddings, baby showers, dog naming ceremonies), but at the end of the day, all anybody reeeaaallly wants is to hit up a pizza and ice cream party. And this is coming from a high-ranking member of the tribe of lactose intolerance. So, it is with great fanfare and noisemakers that we invite you to one of the city’s best pizza and ice cream parties - a meal out at L&B Spumoni Gardens.
If you’ve never been, understand that the pizza and ice cream served at L&B are a bit different from what you’re used to.
First of all, let’s talk about the pizza. For all the special slices New York has to offer, you won’t often find us ranting and raving about the Sicilian. Walk into any run-of-the-mill pizzeria and chances are good that its Sicilian square pales in comparison to the standard foldable slice we New Yorkers hold so near and dear. But L&B is slanging square slices that stand up to the top triangles in town. They’re even so dedicated to the craft that they call a normal slice a “round slice.” Go ahead and walk into Joe’s sometime and order a round slice. Odds are you’ll get slapped before you get served. And unlike some of Brooklyn’s other famed pizzerias, L&B won’t make you wait three hours for your food. Pies come out of the kitchen in a normal, humane amount of time.
From there, we have the ice cream, which isn’t even really ice cream, but spumoni. Spumoni is a sort of ice cream/Italian ice hybrid, with small bits of nuts and sometimes fruit mixed in. It’s lighter than Ben and Jerry’s, and a welcome change from your usual cone. Never had it? There’s no better place to make your introduction than Spumoni Gardens.
Between the two of those beautiful things, the sidewalk seating here is always packed with local families on weekend afternoons and teenagers once the sun has gone down. Regardless of what time you go, or which group you happen to join, L&B will be throwing a surefire pizza and ice cream party. BYOParty hats."

Because I was looking for something the other day and realized that our Vinegar Hill House review was from FIVE YEARS AGO. You know what else is from five years ago? A happily married Tiger Woods. Living Michael Jackson (god rest and keep him). The Motorola Droid. Hannah Montana before porn. And to top it all off, I’m pretty sure our initial visit to Vinegar Hill House was the first time we ever had dinner in Brooklyn, which, after all, was brand new at the time.
As the last five years have passed, we at The Infatuation have become considerably more advanced - in experience, in technology, and I am inclined to say, in maturity, but let’s not get carried away. We’ve certainly eaten in Brooklyn a lot more, and Vinegar Hill House has become one of our all time favorites, thanks to consistently excellent food and one of the best outdoor dining situations in the whole damn city.As a result, today’s updated review is not to tell you that things have changed here. It’s to tell you that things are still really, really good here. We love coming to Vinegar Hill House on a summer weekend evening, right as they open, and grabbing a table in the back yard. Sometimes we’ll even make a day of it, starting on the Manhattan side of the Brooklyn Bridge and taking a walk that ends here. We love the vibe of the restaurant, we love the pasta, we love the wine list, and we looooove the pork chop. The only thing we don’t love is the attitude we sometimes get from the front of house staff, ultimately the reason this Vinegar Hill House rating is in the 8′s rather than the 9′s. Being too cool to be nice is so five years ago."

",4.0,American,Underfinger,8.5,"Behind an unmarked, vandalized door on a random street on the border of Chinatown and the Lower East Side is one of New York’s most unique and under-the-radar restaurants. I have no idea why it took us this long to make it to Underfinger (they’ve been open for eleven days), but we finally had dinner here over the weekend. All we can say is that you’ve never seen anything like this before, and yet it feels so familiar. Here’s the story.
The chef at Underfinger, Jesper Paulsen, grew up in Copenhagen just a few miles from Noma, and has eaten there several times. He’s taken that training and applied it to the Scandinavian tradition of serving minimalist finger sandwiches at funerals. The end result is one of the city’s most impressive tasting menus, a somber celebration of “farm-to-finger” ingredients and classic Neo-Nordic techniques.
If you’re having trouble picturing what that might look like, you aren’t alone. Underfinger has a strict no-photography policy, which might explain the lack of Instagrams, or “first looks” or “10 Reasons Why This Place Will Make You Want to Nom” coverage since they initially applied for a liquor license back in 2012. Paulsen believes very strongly in the idea of secrecy, likely a result of his years spent in the Danish army.
The best we can do is try and paint a picture for you, and hope you’ll take our word for it. Underfinger is pretty much what you’d get if you combined the best parts of Momofuku Ko with the best parts of Askerhus, the Norwegian restaurant at Epcot Center. It is both challenging and accessible, fun and at the same time frightening for children. Read the Food Rundown to get a feel for what goes on here, and be sure to book a reservation if you’re planning on checking it out. All you have to do is call on the second Thursday of whatever month is three months before the day that you’d like to visit."

",3.0,Pasta,L’Artusi,9.5,"L’Artusi was badly in need of an updated review. Not because anything has changed, but because we’ve eaten here about 1000 times since we first wrote about it in 2009.
This restaurant is still one of our all time favorites in this town. A few things stand out as qualifications for such an honor: outstanding and consistent food, great service, an excellent wine list, and some ancillary entertainment since we can’t sit still. Let’s address each individually.
L’Artusi is the sister restaurant to Dell’anima, and it’s the larger, louder sister for sure. The cuisine is Italian, and it’s the kind of Italian cooking that’s not afraid to go heavy on big flavors like garlic, lemon, olives, chiles, and fat to win your favor. Not that it’s unrefined - these are some of the most well thought out and beautiful plates we’ve had the pleasure of eating at an indecent pace.
The service is fantastic, from the hosts to the bartenders to the guy getting crazy at the cheese counter. And the wine list here is unparalleled. There’s a huge, expertly curated selection of Italian bottles from every part of the country, categorized by region and accompanied by information on what to expect from each. You can find everything from an excellent Rosso Di Montalcino for $45, to a $650 Gaja Barbaresco that will make you wish you had $650 to spend on wine every night (don’t do that). Stick to the affordable stuff and ask for help. The sommelier will happily lead you to great wine at good value.As for entertainment, that comes in the form of excellent people watching. There is always a good mix in the room of dates in various stages of progression, generally hot people, and a celebrity here and there to pretend you don’t notice. Not to mention one night when some dude spent three minutes violently pounding on the bathroom door that he couldn’t push his way out of, despite the massive “pull please” directly in front of his face. Maybe go easy on the Barolo, dude.
The most important thing about L’Artusi, though, is how you do it. Here are a few things to know: it’s critical that you sit at the bar if you are a party of two. The tables in this place get cramped unless you’re at a big one, and it’s also the easiest way to get a seat - reservations can be hard to come by. It’s also important that you follow our Food Rundown, almost exactly. Everything at L’Artusi is really good, but if you do things our way... it’s great."

",2.0,Thai,Wondee Siam,8.0,"Hell's Kitchen has always been home to a ton of Thai food options, some excellent, some mediocre, and some not so excellent or mediocre. Sorting the good from the bad can be difficult. A quick Google search of ""Best Thai Hell's Kitchen"" returns a mess of results, and you won't have much better luck doing the research on your own.
Here's a quick cheat sheet from The Infatuation, since we like you: For the real deal authentic stuff, Larb Ubol is the move. Pam Real Thai is an extra-spicy fan favorite, and people do a good amount of freaking out over Pure Thai Cookhouse, which is really good. However, we're partial to the little empire known as Wondee. When it comes to Hell's Kitchen Thai, this is where the magic happens.
There's a Wondee Siam, Wondee Siam II, and a Wondee Siam III, though that one has now shuttered. There was never a Wondee Siam IV, but there's a Wondee Siam V on the Upper West Side, just in case you're keeping track. Wondee I is the original, and they'll tell you it's the most ""authentic"" of their mini Thai empire, even though all the menus are practically the same. Confused? Don't worry about it.

",1.0,Tacos,Los Tacos No. 1,8.5,"Some of the best tacos in New York City are hiding from you in the back of Chelsea Market. It’s time you went and found them.
Located just around the corner from Amy’s Bread, Los Tacos No. 1 is an indoor taco stand started by three young taco-preneurs, two from California and one from Mexico. It’s a simple set-up, much like you’d find from any good roadside operation, except instead of the road, Los Tacos No. 1 is serving tacos and quesadillas from a luxury retail sidewalk. And that’s exactly why the quality and authenticity of this food will surprise you. You can’t usually find excellent tacos this close to a sample sale on bedding.The truth is, Los Tacos No. 1 would kick almost any other taco’s ass in this town, no matter where they sold them. We eat a lot of these things, and Los Tacos are the best we’ve found in Manhattan. We’d put them up against pretty much anything in the outer boroughs, too.
There’s one other interesting thing that happens at Los Tacos No. 1, and that’s the high probability that you’ll end up having a conversation with another taco enthusiast as you stand at the counter eating your food. The friendly staff, quality eats, and Mexican jams from the radio will put you and the people around you in a supremely good mood, and the next thing you know, you’re sharing napkins with a stranger.

",4.0,American,Fred's at Barneys NY,7.4,"Very few restaurants in Manhattan can offer you the opportunity to eat a $36 lobster salad out of a $3,000 handbag. Fred's at Barneys is one of them.
Will they actually serve you the food in the bag? No. But if you spend the money downstairs, who's to say what you can or can't do with your Céline? That's the free market at its finest, and if you're shopping/eating here, you may have been the beneficiary of some free market economics.
The real question is, why on earth are we reviewing a famous department store restaurant? Because it's hilarious, that's why. Nowhere else will you find such an entertaining mix of blown-out 55-going-on-22 moms, burnt-out post-college city natives, and people who think they look like celebrities but most definitely aren't. Fred's isn't so much about the food as the atmosphere - but the hand-cut french fries are arguably more of a reason to go to Barneys than Barneys itself. Their green goddess salad dressing is also a supernatural enigma, making otherwise boring vegetables like pea shoots seem appetizing (see: chopped chicken salad.)
If you do end up at Fred's (grandma in town from Boca?), do yourself a favor and embed yourself in the experience. Split one of the house made pizzas and a salad with the table, or the delicious chicken soup. There for dinner? Braised pork bolognese. Just don't make eye contact with any of the regulars. Legend has it you'll turn into stone.  "

If you're going to open an expensive, upscale restaurant that serves rotisserie chicken, it better be the best f*cking rotisserie chicken on the planet. Yes, I know that I sound like an angry grandpa, going on about how a roast bird at the market used to cost $3, and then probably complaining about rap music. But seriously, I buy rotisserie chickens from Whole Foods all the time for $8, and they're at least as good as the ones we've had here.
That's not to say we haven't enjoyed some of the food that we've had at Rotisserie Georgette. There are plenty of good things to eat in this place, and the chicken is pretty tasty, though we found it to be so salty that we sort of felt like lying on the floor for a few hours after dinner. We've also seen some seriously good reviews of this place in reputable publications, like the New Yorker. As far as we can tell, your fondness for this place is directly related to how worried you'll be about bill at the end of the night. And that's really the clientele here - people who don't worry much about bills. This is the kind of restaurant that's ""downtown"" for most of its customers, many of whom just seem excited to be eating somewhere on a Friday night that doesn't have white table cloths. Maybe they'll even play some rock music. No rap, though. That sh*t is ruining this country."

",3.0,French,Maison Kayser,7.8,"If we were reviewing restaurants on the strength of bread and baked goods only, Maison Kayser would score a 10. This chain of award-winning boulangeries was founded in Paris in the late nineties, and now has nearly 100 locations around the world. New York already has four, and they only started two years ago. Le Pain Quotidien, you are officially on notice. Maison Kayser is better, and people can actually pronounce it. Sort of.
In most cases, Maison Kayser is best for when you need to pick up a baguette and an absurd French dessert to bring over to a friend's house for dinner. It's also a good spot to grab a cup of coffee and a chocolate-almond croissant before work. But this location also has a big dining room and serves brunch, which is why you see this review here today.
On any given weekend, this Upper East Side Maison Kayser looks like a Best Buy at 5am on Black Friday. The only difference is that instead of cheap LED TVs, these people are willing to kill each other over eggs and capers. The food is excellent - nearly everything on the menu is simple, delicious, and lighter than you might expect from French cuisine. But the room is often so full that it's uncomfortable, and that tends to bring out the worst in the Upper East Side fur coat crowd. The amazing thing is that the staff seems to know how to handle the clientele (maybe because they're French?), and everything runs pretty smoothly despite the chaos. And if you get there on the early side (before 1pm), the waits don't tend to be too crazy either. Put it this way, we've never let the crowds come between us and one of these on a Saturday afternoon. You shouldn't either."

",2.0,Pizza,Di Fara Pizza,9.0,"A $5 slice is not something we are particularly comfortable with. For a slice to justifiably cost that much money, it should probably either be topped with some kind of delicious and rare animal meat (panda?), or be the last f*cking slice of pizza in the world. The $5 slice of pizza at Di Fara is neither of those things. But it is the best pizza in New York.
It’s the ingredients and the care that set Di Fara apart from the rest, from the sweet and tangy sauce, to the imported cheese and olive oil, to the fresh basil that pizza maker Domenico DeMarco cuts himself. The wait time in this place regularly stretches into the two-hour territory because DeMarco inspects every pie, refusing to rush through the process just because you think you’ve got somewhere to be. You came here for pizza from the best, and you’re going to get pizza from the best, even if it takes all afternoon.
If it’s the money you’re worried about, you can always just order yourself a whole pie ($28) and save a little bit of cost per slice. Or you could just pay the $5 and shut up about it.
Either way, Di Fara knows it has this town by the balls. Midwood is not exactly what you’d call a gentrifying neighborhood, and the rents surely aren’t crazy this deep into Brooklyn. So what gives with the prices? The American dream, that’s what gives. DeMarco is well aware that he earned those lines that wrap around the block on a daily basis, and he seems intent on cashing in on it. And we couldn’t be happier to pay the asking price, no matter how high it rises. A flight to Naples costs a lot more - and there is no guarantee you’d even like the pizza over there any better.
A few things to know before you set off on your Di Fara adventure: They’re closed Monday and Tuesday, they’re closed between 4:30 and 6:30pm every day, it’s cash only, you WILL wait at least an hour for your pie, and you WILL want to order another after you are done making love with the first. Plan accordingly."

",3.0,American,Narcissa,8.6,"We are often asked the following question: “What’s the hottest restaurant in New York City right now?” Then there is almost always the following caveat: “The food doesn’t have to be great.” And another caveat: “I’m not asking for
me. My sister’s boyfriend is a Hollywood lawyer and he’s in town looking for a good place to act like an asshole.” The reason those caveats are so common is because generally the restaurants that are the heaviest on scene in this town are the lightest on substance. They also all seem to serve sushi, but that’s a discussion for another time.
When we first heard about Narcissa, we figured we had another one of those restaurants on our hands. It’s on the ground floor of the east side Standard Hotel, which guarantees a certain type of... clientele. Even the name of this place makes it sound like somewhere a guy who thinks he’s Drake would go to drink champagne with his dinner. But then we figured out who the chef here is, and our perspective changed.
We’re not usually ones to point out where certain members of the kitchen staff came from for the purposes of a review, but in this case, it matters. John Fraser, the chef at Narcissa, is best known for his Upper West Side restaurant, Dovetail. But he also had a pop-up restaurant a few years ago called What Happens When, which is still one of the most memorable dining
experiences we’ve had in this city. He’s a creative guy who knows how to cook things that are both interesting and delicious, and he definitely doesn’t seem like the type who is gonna sign on to make spicy tuna rolls at a typical hotel
restaurant.Sure enough, Fraser has created something special at Narcissa. This place has a unique menu, full of vegetable-focused small plates that also sometimes employ ancient grains, exotic spices, and interesting flavor combinations.
Even the desserts here will blow your mind, thanks to a real deal pastry chef who spent ten years at Gotham Bar and Grill. Add that up with amazing service from the person answering the phone all the way to the people who bring you
your food, and Narcissa is surprisingly devoid of all the things we hate about trendy new restaurants. Yes, there is definitely a scene here. But it’s more subdued and humble than the crowd at the other Standard Hotel. Maybe that’s
because the staff is so nice. Or maybe it’s because people are actually eating the food."

It is, however, another quaint restaurant in the West Village from the folks who brought you the quaintest* of West Village restaurants, Little Owl and Market Table.
Aside from the misleading and somewhat unfortunate name, and aside from the fact that it kind of looks like every single other restaurant in this part of town, The Clam is actually very unique and really damn good. The idea seems to be that they've gone all New York City on the roadside clam shack, meaning that they put it in the West Village, added tablecloths, and put pork belly in many of the dishes. In your face, New England.
The menu at The Clam is as clammy as you'd expect, with the bivalve at least making an appearance on most of the plates. Not into eating from the half shell? Here's the good news: The things that we actually liked best here didn't even have clams in them, like raw scallop crudo with pear and hazelnuts, and some sort of Mexican seafood cocktail with the shrimp in the sauce. Good luck finding that in Rhode Island. As a matter of fact, good luck finding Rhode Island. Might as well just stick around the city this summer.

Maybe some flat seltzer. Oh, and unopened cans of tennis balls. But down the street from the L train Jefferson stop, in the garage of an unassuming red brick building, you won't find anything soggy or flat. In this, the most delicious garage in town, some of the city's best tacos are being served.
Tortilleria Mexicana Los Hermanos is a tortilla factory first, Mexican cantina second. If you think about it, that kind of split personality makes perfect sense. What could be a better place to eat fresh corn tortillas than a tortilla factory that just so happens to top them off with meat and veggie fixings? Nobody ever said, ""this tortilla is so good, I'd hate for it be ruined by adding chorizo to each bite."" And if you know somebody who does say that kind of thing, you need to find some new people to hang out with.
Los Hermanos’ menu is so straightforward, the staff doesn't even feel the need to take your order. To avoid anything getting lost in translation, the system here requires you to jot down your picks on a piece of scrap paper and slide it across the counter to the ladies working the grill.

If the main area is full, you can even walk into the factory - mind the parked car and the tortilla equipment - and cozy up to one of the tables on the other side of the glass.
With tacos priced at $2.25 a pop, tostadas for $2.50, and a quality sized quesadilla for $3.25, you can have a delicious and filling meal at Los Hermanos for under $15. You're out for BYOB Mexican food, in a garage, in Bushwick. What else would you expect?"

",1.0,Latin,La Isla Cuchifritos,7.6,"La Isla Cuchifritos is exactly what it sounds like: an island full of jujyfruits. Except instead of jujyfruits, this place has a wall-mounted menu of fried finger foods. Ok, so it's not exactly what it sounds like, but you get the idea.
An oasis under elevated train tracks, La Isla is a Puerto Rican greasy spoon serving up pork products that the whole family can enjoy. With locations in Bushwick, the Bronx, and Sunset Park, La Isla has a strong following in a number of neighborhoods. We've been to the Bushwick location a few times now, and love it for the fact that a) it's cheap and delicious, and b) it sort of feels like you're grubbing in tropical Puerto Rico rather than not-so-tropical Brooklyn.
We were initially drawn here for the fried treats known as ""cuchifritos,"" but have found that the best bites actually come from other parts of the menu. The half chicken and rice is as good a rotisserie style bird as we've had in recent memory, and the roasted pork - served by the pound - is truly excellent. Top it off with a side of sweet plantains, and this is a $15 meal for two worth celebrating. And by celebrating, we mean ordering the fried pork stomach and codfish cakes to take for the ride home."

",3.0,Greek,Periyali,7.7,"Periyali is not your father's Greek restaurant. It's your grandma's, and she's drunk on ouzo in the back with her friends.
Open since 1987 (seriously), Periyali has been a staple of Greek dining in our city for a very long time. The restaurant got a facelift in 2006 to keep up with the changing times (see, computers), and as a result feels a bit more modern than you might expect for a place that's 27 years old. But make no mistake that this is a relic from another era.
When it comes to the food, Periyali is responsible for much of what one might call ""Modern Greek Cuisine"" in New York City. OK, nobody actually calls it that, but they did make this particular kind cooking viable in upscale restaurants. People weren't serving grilled octopus and moussaka on white tablecloths before this place existed.
Fast forward to 2014, and Periyali is still serving up some pretty damn good Greek dishes - especially that previously mentioned octopus. There are, however, a lot of sleepy items on the menu that won't leave much of an impression, and the wine list could most definitely use an overhaul. But if you stick to some of the classics and pretty much anything lamb, you'll be in good shape. It's also worth noting that Periyali has a big back room that plays often plays host to some pretty lively parties. Maybe keep that in mind just in case someone special has a birthday coming up. Your Nana is gonna tear this place down on her 80th."

It's also important to decide whether or not you're looking for a sleek, ""Scarpetta in Williamsburg"" feel to your evening, because that's what goes on here. Basically, Antica Pesa is a trip, and it's one you need to be prepared for.
We had not considered any of those things before our visit to Antica Pesa, and were a bit caught off guard by what came at us. First of all, this is a beautiful restaurant that probably cost well into the millions to design and decorate. Not something you'd typically find on a random stretch of Berry Street. Second, the staff here is very intense. Antica Pesa has a sister restaurant in Rome, so this place is full-on Italian in both attitude and passion for what they do. We love that, but prepare yourself for lots of firm handshakes, and a guy in a $3,000 suit and neck scarf who insists on doling out the pasta portions among your table himself. All in all, it's both crazy and endearing, and a far cry from some of the other restaurants around here that hand you some food and a paper napkin and then wait for you to leave.
As for the food at Antica Pesa, we generally enjoyed it, but also found it to be the least memorable part of the experience. It's entirely possible that we've just become accustomed to the New York City version of Italian cuisine, and this authentic Roman stuff is too subtle and nuanced for our overactive taste buds. It's also entirely possible that Antica Pesa is just a bit hit and miss. There were a few items that we really liked on this menu, and then there were some simple things, like Cacio e Pepe, that seemed poorly executed.
At the end of the day, we probably won't rush back to Antica Pesa for a full blown meal, but we'd happily come grab a drink and a seat by the fireplace at the bar. If only to catch a glimpse of the staff when one of the many celebrities that apparently frequent this place walks in. We imagine lots of touching."

But Om is certainly surviving - because Om is f*cking awesome.
It might surprise you that we had this restaurant on our Hit List ahead of the many more well known Curry Hill or East Village Indian spots, but we did because friends of ours who live nearby absolutely swear by it. And since taking their recommendation, we’ve been back to Om a lot. We really can’t get enough of this place. The food is authentic, light, and incredibly good. It’s also very reasonably priced, with most dishes coming in at under $15. The chicken curry here is one of the best in this city, and we’ve also become addicted to the Bhindi Masala (an okra dish) and Vegetable Biryani.
Ultimately, you really can’t go wrong no matter what you order at Om, but we do recommend that you order from a table in the restaurant as opposed to a seat on your couch. Om definitely delivers well, but you should let this place put its best foot forward and have dinner on site. Plus, you and your couch could probably use some time apart."

Otherwise, everything appears to be exactly the same, including the menu: awesome and expensive.
Being that this Sushi Seki is on 23rd Street, as opposed to the priciest zip code in the country, it seemed a good opportunity to point out that there is actually a (relatively) economical way to experience all that this place has to offer - the Special Platter for Two. For $80, you get 20 pieces of sushi and two rolls, and nearly all of Seki’s greatest hits will be represented. That’s a pretty solid deal for you and a friend, and it will even leave some room in your budget for a bottle of sake.

Good Thai food, on the other hand, requires some digging. Thai food worth getting up off the couch? Not as easy to find. Thai food worth putting on pants and shoes for?!!? Borderline unheard of.
Enter SriPraPhai, a Woodside favorite that has been killing it in Queens for over two decades. A New York success story, SriPraPhai (pronounced see-PRA-pie, we think) was the brainchild of a Thai nurse turned appliance store owner turned baker turned restaurateur. Initially a small, hole-in-the-wall spot, the place has since expanded into a larger space to accommodate the masses. So if you show up during prime feeding time, be prepared to take a number and wait outside.
The menu at SriPraPhai is as thick as a Bangkok travel guide, featuring dishes from all over Thailand, from North's signature khao soi to a few pages of seafood dishes commonly found in the South. Waiters hustle through the space blindly -- so no walking and texting -- and food is served when it is ready, regardless of how much tabletop you have available. With prices ranging from $5 (steamed dumplings) to $17 (soft shelled crab), nothing here will cost you too much. And that's ideal, because this is the kind of place where you’re going to want to order big and eat even bigger, until your mouth is so on fire that you have to stop.
All in all, a meal worth the whole pants-and-shoes hassle."

",4.0,American,M. Wells Steakhouse,7.0,"Let’s get weird.
That’s all we could think to ourselves as we took our seats for dinner at the M. Wells Steakhouse. Between the awesomely unique meals that we’d had at their now-defunct diner, and the endless stream of “bone-in” burger and live trout photos coming out of this place, we were ready for a three ring circus of steakhouse stunts. Why else would we venture out to Long Island City to eat a rib eye?
What we got instead from the M. Wells Steakhouse was a pretty typical steakhouse experience - a sort of boring one. There are some interesting things going on here, but only really in the context of the restaurant’s location. It’s a beautiful space that was once an auto-body shop, with an open kitchen and a big wood-burning grill. None of that would be particularly out of place in Williamsburg, but in Long Island City, this is a restaurant unto itself. And that’s probably most of the story. The food is pretty good, but we found ourselves missing all that weird we’d hoped for. Sure, there was some powdered ketchup on our grilled wedge salad, and there’s bone marrow in the onion soup, but there were none of those crazy strokes of genius that the original M. Wells was so well known for. Where’s the steakhouse version of foie gras bibimbap? And why am I eating a run-of-the-mill lobster roll?
If you live in this area, or you find yourself here often, M. Wells is a decent spot for a nice dinner. You can even follow it up with a drink at Dutch Kills for a pleasant, albeit expensive, evening in Queens. Unfortunately, that’s as weird as things are gonna get. Queens."

How else do you think we can afford to eat out all the time?
Brooklyn may take Manhattan to school when it comes to a myriad of dressed down cuisines, but ramen isn't one of them. Naruto is good, Dassara is surely interesting, and Ganso is OK. But in general, the 718 serves ramen with a side of disappointment. Chuko though? This spot is the J-A-M. We're late to the party here, but everyone on Twitter who's been telling us to come here for so long was right. Welcome to our favorite ramen joint in Brooklyn. Chuko has a little bit of Momofuku Noodle Bar going on (don't they all), in that it's hip, cool, and constantly buzzing. They have a short list of ramen bowls, and also serve a small but well-executed menu of non-traditional Japanese dishes. The kale salad here is up there with the best of them, and their kimchi ramen with ground pork promptly moves into our top five ramen bowls in NYC.
The best part about Chuko, though, is the location. It's three blocks from Barclays Center, making this an ideal pre-game move for some noodles and a Sapporo.

This Spanish restaurant/wine bar from the folks that brought you Tia Pol, Txikito, and La Vara is very good, but we always had some reservations due to the tiny space and the fact that the thing El Quinto Pino has been best known for, the uni panini, can be your own first date worst enemy. Yes, it’s delicious, but it’s also packed with so much wasabi that it’s impossible to eat without tearing up and making ridiculous faces. And nothing says “get me out of here” like a girl who appears to be crying for no reason.
But now we’re happy to tell you that we can fully recommend El Quinto Pino as an excellent spot for a date, food-induced waterworks or otherwise. The reason for our newfound enthusiasm is that they have recently expanded into the space next door and set up a proper dining room with real seats. The menu has also been expanded to better suit two people looking for a sit-down meal, and they even take reservations. We’ve had dinner in the new room a few times now and have been really impressed with everything from the food to the service to the wine and sangria. “El Comedor at El Quinto Pino,” as it’s being called, is also doing lunch and brunch, in case you’re just looking for a first date with a really good sandwich.

lucky f*ckers get to work in the Chelsea Market building, and for that we're

We have a few favorite destinations in this great upscale food court,

Lucky Duck for something a bit more healthy. Now we can add Cull & Pistol into
the mix for anytime we've got the itch to throw back a dozen oysters and some
beers in a place without windows. (We have very specific cravings).
Cull & Pistol is a casual raw bar and seafood restaurant from the owners of
the adjacent market, The Lobster Place. The Lobster Place is a prolific
wholesaler of seafood to area restaurants, and their Chelsea Market storefront
is one of the best places to buy fish in town. So there's no question as to
the quality of Cull & Pistol's product. The food they make with that product
is pretty good too, as long as you know what to order. The question is, why
should you eat here, as opposed to the hundred other places in New York that
serve oysters and a lobster roll? The short answer is location. This isn't the
best lobster roll in town, but it's probably the best one in the neighborhood.
They also have a $1 oyster happy hour that you should be taking advantage of
if you work in or near this building. As a matter of fact, you should probably

Also, the name is awesome. Salt and fat
- our bodies prefer it to moisturizer.
We've all seen the Salt & Fat movie before. A catchy name inside a pig logo, serving up a swine-centric menu with a side of Asian flair. In Manhattan and Brooklyn, they're a dime a dozen, but out in Queens, not so much. The difference between dining at a hot restaurant in Manhattan and a hot restaurant in Sunnyside is like night and day. Salt & Fat is easily the coolest restaurant in a five mile radius, and even though there's a no reservation policy, you can walk in and get a table with zero issue during prime time. They greet you with free bacon popcorn, drink prices aren't insulting, and you can eat like kings and queens for under $50 a head. They're also the only restaurant we've ever been to that serves Thousand Island dressing with everything. Salt & Fat doesn't go out of their way to impress with a slick design like the others either. Instead, what you have is a restaurant that was probably once a used DVD store, and all they did to the space was add a kitchen and a bunch of pig paraphernalia. The orange lighting and stained drop ceilings remain, and make Salt & Fat feel more like a Chinatown dive than a any place a ""gourmand"" would dine. God, we hate that word.
The truth is, we wanted to love Salt & Fat more than we actually did. Every dish on the menu reads like a carnivore's delight, and while some items are incredible, like the BLT buns and the crispy pork trotter, others, like the pork belly and the fried chicken, completely miss the mark. If we lived in the neighborhood, we'd certainly be eating here all the time. However, we can't suggest making a specific trip out here on the 7-train just to eat another pork bun and lots of Thousand Island dressing."

Wallflower was created by a former bartender at Daniel, so the fact that this high-end watering hole has things on lock down doesn't surprise us. The menu is a nice compilation of crudo, cheese, pâté, and terrines for a light graze, along with things like short ribs and duck sausage for those looking to go all in.

We found this little place The Marshal, and you need to know about it.
The Marshal is a very small restaurant on 10th Avenue, on a picturesque block that’s also home to a huge gas station and a condo building that looks like something a child with poor depth perception built out of Legos. Hell’s Kitchen encapsulated. A friend of ours turned us on to it after he randomly met the owner in a wine shop. We decided to check it out, and it’s definitely the kind of place that would be owned by a guy you’d randomly meet in a wine shop. Everyone at The Marshal is exceptionally friendly. The food also happens to be excellent.
As a matter of fact, The Marshal reminds us a lot of a Hell’s Kitchen version of Upstate Beer & Oyster Bar. Both are great neighborhood restaurants with dedicated regulars, and they both share an appreciation for New York. Nearly everything that The Marshal serves comes from somewhere in our great state and is then cooked in a wood-burning oven. The food is simple and homey - as in the best thing on the menu is meatloaf. It’s exactly the kind of place that we’d visit weekly if we lived nearby, especially if we lived in one of those weird looking condos. Do those things even have kitchens?

Those smart people are opening up shops around town that serve Aussie espresso drinks with cool names like the “flat white” and the “long black,” and all of your coffee snob friends are buying in big time.
Little Collins is one of these new Australian coffee shops, but where it’s from is not what we find remarkable. We’re more impressed with where it is. Situated on Lexington Avenue at 56th Street, Little Collins is a total anomaly. This is the kind of sleek, trendy cafe that you expect to find in Tribeca or Brooklyn, not twelve paces from the world’s most disgusting TGI Friday’s. But the owners must have simply decided to act on what many of us who work in Midtown have known forever - there is nothing good to eat for breakfast or lunch around these parts. It’s about time someone tried to fix that.
Whatever the reason that Little Collins ended up in Midtown East, we’re incredibly happy that it did. I am a big coffee drinker, so I’m obviously glad to have this as a stop along my morning walk to work. The people are nice, they use fancy machines to make the drinks, and the place is always full of regulars (Australians). More importantly, though, we love coming here for the food they serve. Little Collins has an excellent menu of sandwiches and salads, and they’re all very reasonably priced. Two people can have a quick, high-quality meal in this place for around $25, or you can grab a sandwich and go for under $10.

And considering Jewish and Japanese people are responsible for some of our favorite food on the planet, we had a feeling this was going to be a good one.
Although Shalom Japan's name suggests a bit of a novelty shop, this is absolutely a serious restaurant. They're enjoying themselves a lot, and you can feel it in every aspect of the dining experience. But this is place is no joke. For instance, they're making cocktails with Manischewitz, which is hilarious, but they balance that with a well -curated wine list, plenty of craft beers, and a hand picked selection of sake and shochu. The same can be said for the food, which always includes a few items that will make you smile when you read the menu, and then you eat those things and your smile turns into to a dropped jaw. We were blown away by how the marriage of these two cuisines resulted in such delicious, bold flavors.
One thing about Shalom Japan that's for certain is that there's a lot more Japan than Shalom. The menu may start out with challah bread and end with a lox bowl, but everything else leans to the Japanese side, and that seems to work out just fine. Nearly everything we had here was excellent, and we ate a lot. Shalom Japan also offers a tasting for $65, which is a pretty good deal considering you get to sample the entire menu.

We’ve always loved this spot for its late night hours, but the sushi is pretty damn spectacular no matter when you eat it.
Today we bring you an updated review of Seki, not because the restaurant has changed since our initial assessment, but because we’ve really got this place dialed in now. In our early days of eating here, we would sit down and wander through some very good but fairly standard sushi orders, and then cap the meal off with one of their legendary spicy scallop hand rolls. That’s certainly not a bad way to operate, but it’s not the best way to operate. We’ve had countless meals at Seki since then and have wised up significantly to the game. So here we are to pass that wisdom on to you.
A meal at Sushi Seki is all about knowing two things: the few special pieces to order, and where to knock off an armored truck before dinner. If you do it up right, your meal will set you back $100 per person. It will also be one of the most satisfying sushi experiences ever. Especially if you can experience it on someone else’s dime.
Assuming you’ve got the money to spend (regardless of where it came from), follow this updated Food Rundown and reap the benefits of our tireless and insanely pricey research. You basically want to eat this place like Noah’s Ark, ordering each amazing sushi specimen two by two until your stomach and your bank account can take no more.

It had been a long time since we’d actually eaten in this restaurant, thanks mostly to the fact that reservations are nearly impossible to secure. We
finally managed to make our way in a few times in the last month or so and decided a review refresher was in order. Five years in restaurant terms is essentially a geologic period. And yes, that’s a dinosaur reference.
After our recent visits, two things seem apparent: Locanda Verde is at least as good, if not slightly better than it was back in 2009, and it’s also still
a serious scene. The food is consistent and generally excellent, and this is still one of the best celebrity sightings destinations in all of New York. The only downside is that along with that scene comes a pretty uncomfortable environment at times. Between the bar and the dining room, a lot of people get crammed into this space. And if you are a party of two, chances are good that you will end up dining at a very small table, in very close proximity to someone who will likely be wearing crocodile somewhere on their person.
If you can live with all of that, and you can actually manage to get yourself in, then Locanda Verde should be near the top your the list when it comes to the best restaurants in this town.

This quaint little restaurant has done phenomenally well over the last few years, thanks almost entirely to the fact that it's a real life manifestation of what Martha Stewart probably considers porn. There are baskets and baked goods everywhere, along with a bunch of knick-knacks that likely came from flea markets around the south of France, or Restoration Hardware. There's even a little bike that sits out front every day, just so you can imagine what it would be like to live in a world where bikes are decoration. Sounds nice, right? It is. At least until you meet the staff.
Somewhere along the way, success has gotten to Buvette's head. The servers always seem angry that it's crowded and angry that you're there, and we're not even exaggerating that. On at least three occasions in the last two months, we've been in for weekday breakfast and have been greeted by someone who genuinely seems annoyed to see us. And we're usually there early, before the crowds gather. For a minute we were thinking that maybe it was just us, but then we had two different friends tell us the same thing after having a meal here: ""that place was good, but why are they so mean?""
One theory is that they are training people to send them over to the new Buvette location that recently opened in Paris. But that doesn't really hold up because people in Paris are way nicer than this. Maybe they're just trying to thin out the crowds. If they're not careful, it'll probably work."

",3.0,Mexican,Papatzul,4.2,"Not that you need more options for this, but put Papatzul on the list for your next birthday/bachelorette party/big night out that starts with a mediocre dinner. As far as we can tell, Papatzul is basically where people who love Tortilla Flats graduate to when they get a boyfriend or a job where something is actually expected of them.
We didn't end up at Papatzul because someone we know named Lindsey was turning 27 again, but because a few different people mentioned it to us within the span of a month. Sometimes random coincidences happen like that, and we usually take those coincidences to mean that the universe wants us to eat somewhere. We're also always hoping to find some unexpectedly good Mexican food in this town. Unfortunately that's not what we found here.
Instead, Papatzul seems to be just more middle-of-the road Mexican that pairs acceptably with strong margaritas. It's the kind of place where you have to yell at the person sitting across from you, and should probably order everything the moment you see your server because you might not see him again for a while. There are a few highlights on the menu that are more than serviceable for a big group looking for a fiesta, but otherwise there's little to get excited about here. Unless, that is, you get really excited about paper hats."

",3.0,Thai,Somtum Der,7.6,"Authenticity is the name of the game at Somtum Der, an East Village restaurant with one other location - Bangkok. Apparently, New York City and Bangkok both share a similar problem when it comes to Thai cuisine, in that the majority of it is either toned down or sweetened up for consumer palates. Somtum Der is trying to bring the strong and spicy Isan flavors of Northeastern Thailand to both cities, complete with lots of fermented fish sauce, and Bird's Eye chilies, but probably minus the grilled field rats. Though if they had any balls, they'd have a New York City version of that dish on the menu too. Your move, letter grade department.
Som Tum is actually the word for green papaya salad, and a good portion of this menu is focused on examples of what a real authentic version of that dish tastes like. There are eight different papaya salads on the menu at Somtum Der, and almost all are a bit different than the ones that you'll find at your average Thai restaurant in New York. For example, the most authentic version, Tum Poo-Plara, has crab and lots of the aforementioned fermented fish sauce in it. It most definitely does not lack flavor, but that funky fish sauce is a taste that not everyone will find appealing.
I suppose that's the story with this place. We have really enjoyed our meals at Somtum Der, and the best things we've had are the dishes that remain truest to Isan cuisine. But you'll find a lot of other stuff on this menu that's there to appeal to a wider audience, and that stuff is way less interesting. The end result is a menu so big that it's easy to miss the really good food and end up with a mediocre dinner on your table. If it were up to us, we'd cut the menu down to the only the best and most authentic dishes, and if that means that some guy looking for Pad Thai has to eat somewhere else, then so be it. You don't want that guy anyway. You want the guy who comes here because he wants to drink a few beers and eat some larb that will burn his face off. And by the way, that guy would totally try some grilled rat. Just sayin'.
To that end, this Food Rundown is essentially what we think is a fail proof order at Somtum Der. We tried plenty of other things that we won't bother listing below because we liked them a whole lot less. Eat accordingly and you'll be happy."

",1.0,Tacos,Otto’s Tacos,7.4,"We’ve got a rule here at The Infatuation, which really only applies to me, because I am the main offender: No more East Coast taco complaining. We’ve beaten that horse to death, and we’re annoying even ourselves at this point. The good news though, is that after years of doing it wrong, there’s a crop of NYC taco joints in town that are doing it right. Los Tacos No. 1, Taqueria Diana[(http://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/taqueria-diana), and today’s review subject, Otto’s Tacos, are all bringing some much-needed West Coast flavor out East. You probably won’t be surprised to hear us say that we like where all this is going.
Otto’s is a taco spot in the East Village with a very simple menu and homemade corn tortillas. In true West Coast fashion, they cook them up hot and fresh every hour of every day, and they’re pretty much perfect. The tortillas are then filled with your choice of chicken, carnitas, seasonal vegetables, steak, or shrimp, and the end result is simple tacos that are both highly delicious and priced right at $3 and $4 a piece. If you’ve eaten a lot on the West Coast, you will appreciate Otto’s for that simplicity and sensibility.
Speaking of Otto, he’s the owner. You’ll surely meet him when you come by, as he makes it a point to introduce himself to each customer and ask for feedback on the food. He’s just an LA native who felt like he and his friends were being underserved by the current crop of Manhattan tacos. He set out to fix it, even though he had no restaurant experience under his belt. We like people, we like tacos, and we like problem-solvers. So yeah, we like Otto’s. A lot."

",3.0,Mediterranean,Glasserie,7.1,"A wise person (my mom) once told me that an effective way to make up your mind about something is to make a list of pros and cons, review it, and then make your decision based on which column has the most convincing things in it. I've applied that to many important decisions in my life, such as where to live after college and whether or not to buy a trampoline. Today I've decided to give it a shot with this restaurant review of Glasserie, so that you can effectively decide whether or not to spend your money there.
Pros:
- Awesome atmosphere. Maybe the best restaurant vibes in Brooklyn.
- Interesting food, influenced heavily by the chef's Israeli heritage.
- Lots of excellent vegetarian options on the menu.
- Great outdoor/patio situation.
- Square bar, ideal for scoping other patrons across the bar.
- One of the best things on the menu is bread.  
Cons:
- One of the best things on the menu is bread.
- Staff is too cool to have emotions.
- Portions are on the small side, especially if you are sharing.
- Lots of hype. Might be responsible for the term ""New Greenpoint.""
- Other patrons might be scoping you from the bar.
- Isolated location, unless you live in an abandoned warehouse nearby.  
The way we see it, those pros outweigh the cons, though there are certainly some significant cons Ultimately, we like Glasserie. But we might like it for the ambiance more than anything else. If you do decide to go, bring a bunch of friends, and try a few things to share. And let us know if you need help with any of the other big decisions in your life, like whether or not to buy a trampoline. That is a trick question."

",3.0,Spanish,Toro,7.8,"Boston brought us something, and it's not a Ben Affleck movie or a new sports team to hate. Instead we've been given an NYC location of the popular South End Spanish restaurant, Toro.
Sort of.
If you've ever been to the Toro in Boston, you probably know it to be a very busy, but pretty excellent little tapas joint with an open kitchen and about 65 seats. It's cozy and crowded, and that's all part of the appeal. Drinking sherry and eating pinchos in a small warm room in the winter is a pretty great way to spend dinner, especially when you can feel that everyone else in the room is having a good time too.
But the version of Toro that we got in New York is quite a bit different than its Boston counterpart. First of all, it's massive. There are supposedly 125 seats, which according to my state university education makes it just shy of double the size of the original location. But the 30 foot ceilings and huge bar area make the room feel much bigger than that. This Toro feel less like a restaurant and more like a dinner warehouse where food parties happen. Food parties with expensive ham. And when you consider the location they chose to open in, it sort of makes sense. The restaurant is on the 11th Avenue side of the same building that houses Colicchio & Sons and Del Posto, situated just north of the Meatpacking District. They're going squarely after the same people that frequent places like Catch and The Dutch, which is to say people that often care more about the scene than the food when they're deciding where to eat. So far, those people seem to like this place A LOT.
We like Toro too, for both the food and the atmosphere. Yes, we prefer the more intimate surroundings of the Beantown location, and yes, there are other Spanish restaurants in New York that we like more. But this New York Toro achieves the same feel good vibes of the original, and that's what makes it appealing. You can tell that everyone in this place is having fun, eating egg-on-a-spoon things and drinking out of porrons (see, ancient Spanish beer bong for wine). The menu is massive, and there are definitely some hits and misses, so knowing what to order (and having a reservation) is they key to having a good meal here. Whatever you do, don't let the server order for you. Last time we tried that at Toro we ended up with enough food to feed half of the Iberian peninsula, and a bill that added up to about half of its current GDP. All in the name of fun."

",2.0,Japanese,Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop,8.3,"There are eight vendors serving food and drink at Gotham West Market, including Infatuation favorite The Cannibal, reputable Brooklyn sandwich shop Court Street Grocers, and El Colmado, a Spanish tapas bar run by the dude from Tertulia. But the Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop is the one that's really got people fired up. This is the first-ever permanent NYC restaurant from international ramen icon Ivan Orkin, and if you find yourself wondering who that is and why he doesn't sound like a Japanese person, allow us to fill you in on that too.
Ivan Orkin is a white Jewish man who grew up in Long Island, majored in Japanese at the University of Colorado, graduated from the Culinary Institute of America, and ultimately opened up a ramen shop...in Tokyo. And not only did his ramen succeed in Japan, it has become one of the most critically acclaimed and popular shops in the country. As you can probably imagine, that's quite the feat for a foreigner, and Ivan's legend has been steadily growing since he got in the game in 2007. Aside from a few pop ups here and there, ramen fans in New York were relegated to reading about his stuff in places like Ramen Magazine, and yes that's apparently a thing that really exists. But now Ivan is finally here with a permanent Ivan Ramen location.
Like most of the other vendors in the Gotham West Market, Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop is cafeteria-style eating. You walk up to a counter, order your food, find a seat, and wait for your name to be called. Then what gets delivered to you is a bowl (or two) of seriously excellent ramen that we've decided we could eat every single day. The well-balanced chicken-based broth and the excellent rye noodles add up to an incredible soup that isn't nearly as heavy or nap-inducing as something like what you find at Ippudo. We also like this set-up, which is a piece of cake compared to the long waits at some of the other popular ramen spots around town. Here's to hoping that the 11th Avenue location make for manageable crowds. Ivan is also opening a flagship restaurant on the lower east side soon, so consider the Slurp Shop an appetizer to the forthcoming main attraction. Fire up your chopsticks.

",3.0,French,Cafe Tallulah,5.0,"I think we can all agree that the UWS would greatly benefit from a little downtown flavor. God knows the UES has, thanks to recent additions of The East Pole, The Meatball Shop and The Penrose, all breathing hip, new life into an otherwise tired #EEEEEATS scene. It's too bad then the UWS gets stuck with Cafe Tallulah leading the charge, a massive bi-level French/Mediterranean upstairs bistro and downstairs lounge. Clearly, ""flavor"" is all in the eye of the beholder, and unfortunately, the Cafe Tallulah crew thinks lounge chic is what the UWS needed. Sucks for us.
Remember, in the early 00's, when lounges were all the rage in NYC? There were tons of them, mostly in Chelsea, and all your friends who went to Wisconsin had their birthday parties there. Well, if you're looking to relive the old back room of Pop Burger glory days, take a trip to Cafe Tallulah. Metallic walls, plush red curtains, big artsy photos of models and of course, Ultra Chilled Volume 1 as the soundtrack. Moby into St. Germain into Theivey Corporation, bonafide elevator music we were all guilty of being into thirteen years ago. They even brought in someone from Employees Only to run the cocktail program. Bartender, a Cosmopolitan please.
Despite this restaurant already being on its third chef in ten months of existence, we found the typical bistro fare to be generally better than we expected. It's all hit or miss, and the appetizers are where it's at. One can achieve a solid and reasonably priced meal by pairing a tartare, a salad and the scallop app, which was the best thing we ate. Don't get pasta. The descriptions sound delicious, but the results shouldn't be served as restaurant food. The service was annoying. This is one of those places where, even for a table of five, the servers don't write down the orders. What's the point? They forgot to bring our beers, forgot to bring a salad, and forgot to bring an entree.
While Tallulah feels misguided for 2013, it's still a welcome addition to a hood that's desperate for any kind of of Action at the Bar. This huge space is in close proximity to Central Park, Lincoln Center, and is right in the nexus of everything on the UWS, so it can definitely come in handy."

",4.0,French,Per Se,8.5,"I got kicked out of Per Se.
Allow me to elaborate.
Back in September, I had a 5:30pm reservation for four on a Saturday night. One member of our group was coming in that day from outside of the country, and her flight ended up getting severely delayed. This presented us with an interesting dilemma - cancel the reservation and pay a $175 per person fee, or keep the reservation and hope for the best, meaning that she'd be late but not by much. We decided on the latter (because this is dinner, not live television) and headed to the restaurant. Once we got there, we explained the situation to the staff, who seemed annoyed but aware that they should at least try to be somewhat accommodating. 5:45 and 6:00 passed, and the hosts began to express some displeasure. Finally our tardy guest arrived at 6:15, and we were seated for dinner.
From that moment until the end of our meal, we had a pleasant and impressive experience, just as you would expect from one of the most acclaimed restaurants in the world. The food was excellent, and everything seemed to have turned out OK, despite the fact that we were very late for our reservation. Dessert, petit fours, and coffee were served, along with the check which was settled in a reasonably hasty manner. That's when things got interesting.
Not all that long after our check was paid - let's call it fifteen minutes - a staff member arrived at our table. This man in a suit chatted us up for a while with some small talk, and then explained that he would like to show us the kitchen. We obliged, because we are New Yorkers, and real kitchens are majestic places that we usually only see on vacation or Pinterest. About three minutes into our boring and seemingly pointless walkthrough, it occurred to me what was happening. We were being tastefully ejected. Sure enough, when our tour concluded, we were not brought back to the dining room, but through another door that led directly to the foyer and a hostess holding our jackets.
Now, before you decide who the real asshole in this equation is (me or him), consider this. I would argue that even though we were late, there would have been a much easier and far less dickish way to handle this situation -honesty. Had this guy simply walked up to us and said, ""I'm sorry folks, but we really need this table,"" we would have jumped up immediately and finished our conversation in the lounge, or even somewhere outside if they so wished. We're all adults here, as evidenced by the fact that we just spent a Vespa on dinner. But that option was never afforded to us. Instead, we got played.
Clearly this situation is unique, and hopefully not something you'd encounter if you decided to visit Per Se. But it's also not our first bad experience here. There seems to be this thing at Per Se where the staff acts like it's your privilege to be in their restaurant. Instead of a warm welcome, it feels more like you've been granted access to the king's palace, and they're worried that you're going to act like a commoner. Even when we came here previously to eat in the salon, our waiter treated us like we were sitting at the kid's table during family dinner, and I wasn't even the one who ended up spilling the wine. This guy dribbled on our placemat when he poured both of our glasses, and then he just walked away. That doesn't happen at Daniel, no matter where you're sitting. Then again, the staff at Daniel will also give you a tour of the kitchen that doesn't end in sadness. All you have to do is ask."

",3.0,American,Contra,8.6,"And the pendulum begins to swing back towards Manhattan. For the first time in a long time, a restaurant that you’d typically expect to pop up in Brooklyn has instead decided to settle on the Lower East Side. Contra, complete with its young risk-taking chefs, daily tasting menu, and earthen tableware, is now open on Orchard Street instead of on Bedford Street. It’s either the
beginning of a trend, or the end of one. We’re not exactly sure which yet.
Either way, Contra is important. It matters because it’s the perfect example of why this city is so f*cking great. What is possibly our best new restaurant of the year just managed to open with pretty much no advance press or hype, because everyone was busy paying attention to a bunch of other new places that probably won’t be relevant (let alone open) five years from now. Even our most enthusiastic of food enthusiasts seem to be still figuring out that Contra exists. But everyone is going to catch up very soon. You won’t find a $55 five-course menu that competes with this place anywhere in town, and that
includes Battersby. Contra is better than both of those places by a long shot.
And so just like we did, it’s only a matter of time before the old food world giants notice this place and crash in on it like a giant Godzilla with
Instagram. The New York Times can’t be far off, Dana Cowin will soon be posting photos from her table three nights a month, and you won’t be able to get a reservation without an internship at one of those places. We just hope that Contra can manage to stay humble throughout the process. There’s already a little bit of dude-attude going on with the service here, and that’s likely to get worse as popularity increases. How they handle the pressure will probably dictate whether a city full of critical diners with lots of options will keep coming back. This isn’t Brooklyn, you know.
The tasting menu at Contra changes almost daily, but take a look at the photos in the Food Rundown to get a sense of what’s available."

",2.0,Japanese,Ramen Yebisu,3.0,"When I was in college, I used to make ramen in my dorm room. I would plug in one of those electric kettles, heat up some water, toss in a block of dehydrated noodles and a pack of seasoning that was probably 90% bath salts and 10% artificial beef dust, and that would be dinner. Sometimes I'd even add a few dashes of hot sauce if I was feeling spicy. It's been a while since I've felt nostalgic for that stuff, but I found myself reminiscing after our recent visit to Ramen Yebisu. Why? Because I realized that I would rather be eating factory packaged sort-of-food than paying $12 for the ramen this place served us.
Ramen Yebisu sits on the corner of N. 6th and Berry in Williamsburg, right in the middle of a highly-concentrated area of Williamsburg shops, restaurants, and cheap looking condos, and just down the street from Music Hall of Williamsburg. It's the perfect place for a trendy new ramen restaurant, partly because of the foot traffic, and also because there's nothing like that anywhere this neighborhood. Unfortunately, Ramen Yebisu has failed miserably so far in filling the void. We have yet to meet anyone that actually likes this place, and on both of our visits it was pretty much empty on a busy Brooklyn weeknight. Word seems to be out that these noodles aren't worth your time or money, and we're here to confirm that just in case you had any doubt.
Our problem with Ramen Yebisu lies mostly with the broth, which always seems to fall flat. And that's not in comparison to the ramen on steroids that people are used to from places like Ippudo. We've had authentic Japanese ramen with mellow flavors, and we like it. But this stuff doesn't seem to have any flavor at all. On top of that, this restaurant seems to be out of order. The service is always confusing, and we found it to be a little bit messy, like they couldn't be bothered to pick up the straw wrappers or wipe down the tables. I know we're in Williamsburg where dirty is supposed to be cool, but guess what, no it isn't. Let's get a broom up in here."

",3.0,Seafood,Esca,7.6,"We’re nearly five years and 800 reviews deep here at Immaculate Infatuation, and it’s kind of ridiculous that Esca hasn’t gotten any love. It’s time to fix that. We’ve been coming here forever, usually accompanied by someone over the age of 70. While my Grandma sure does love Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich’s timeless fish and pasta spot, she’s not alone. Year after year, Esca remains in the conversation of the NYC elite. It’s always jam packed, mostly with the business and commuter crowd. 
For fish lovers, this is like walking into that amazing pet store that had the best selection of tropical fish when you were a kid. “Holy cow. They have Tetras, Swordtails, AND Kissing Gouramis!” Being the lone great restaurant in the horrible hot mess of an area where the Lincoln Tunnel, Times Square and The Port Authority all converge has actually been a great thing for Esca. Since there’s nothing even remotely noteworthy around here when it comes to food, Esca is the place to be.
As for the menu, the raw fish crudos are out of this world. Start with lots of them. Definitely get a pasta or two, we’ll get into that below. And when it comes to picking your fish entree, it’s all a matter of taste because the simple preparations are seasoned perfectly and you really can’t go wrong.
Reservations aren’t tough to come by at Esca, and during warm weather months, there’s also a great outdoor patio for maximum quality fish enjoyment. Despite minimal updates to a dated space over the years, Esca remains a safe bet for an excellent meal. It certainly proves that good food never goes out of style."

",2.0,American,Good Enough To Eat,7.0,"The Upper West Side may not be flush with noteworthy dining out options, but they certainly have one meal on lockdown - brunch. Good Enough To Eat has been an institution up in these parts for a good 30 years. It's essentially like going to eat at your Aunt's house in the country. You know, the one that hoards random kitchen chotchkies and cooks up a storm. They recently moved out of their homey, lived in upstate-in-the-big-city space, to a new, bigger room with nowhere near as much charm. The new spot feels like they decorated the local Irish pub with a bunch of Vermont flair, which is kind of sad. Regardless, G.E.T.E. is the jam for brunch.
Good Enough To's #EEEEEEATS are nothing fancy. Simple, heavy handed home cooking that's free of pretension. We're all about the biscuits with strawberry butter, the omelettes, the pancakes, the chicken salad and all the baked goods. Although they're most well known for their brunch, which you'll always have to wait in line for, G.E.T.E is serving all day long. It's a great spot for Moms to bring the strollers during the day and also a sleeper spot for local Dads who need to get out of the house for a couple hours to watch a game. Sitting at the bar with beer and burger in hand isn't a bad situation. Although it really doesn't matter at a place like this, it needs to be mentioned; the service is deplorable. Literally, non-existent. On our most recent visit, a single poor soul was handling the entire inside dining room. We had to walk up to the bar for water refills, mosey on over to the register to ask for a check and decided to start bussing the table next to us ourselves after it remained empty for a full half hour. You're welcome, 30 people waiting in line to be seated. We're trying to help you eat pancakes sooner rather than later because clearly, no one else is.
We'll end this review with a quote from one of our favorite wordsmiths Sloane Crosley, who summed up Good Enough To Eat pretty perfectly in her Friday Fives a couple years back. ""There are other brunches that will fill your stomach with better pancakes, cholesterol and a side of regret (egg!), but none look like the state of Vermont had an orgasm, put tables in it and is now seating…”"

",1.0,Bar Food,Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken,7.5,"When it comes to the modern gentrification of fried chicken, we consider the Bromberg Brothers of Blue Ribbon the OG. With due respect to Mr. Kennedy and Colonel Sanders himself, it was Blue Ribbon Brasserie's fried chicken that started this whole hipsterized food trend frenzy some 20 years ago. Where as some trends we grow tired of, and fast (Kale! Cronuts! Rooftop Gardens!), we'll never be mad an excess of quality fried chicken.
The Blue Ribbon restaurant group continues its brisk expansion with a fast casual establishment dedicated to their signature poultry. BRFC is, obviously, all about the chicken. They're frying up more wings, breasts and drumsticks than ever before, but that's not all. They're using the entire bird at BRFC, from livers to gizzards to necks. They also have a variety of chicken burgers, which, surprisingly, are pretty damn good. Who would have ever thought we'd enjoy eating a chicken burger? And then there are the fries, man. The f*cking french fries are incredible. McDonalds level. You know when our resident fried chicken expert, Rembert Browne of Grantland fame approves, you're doing something right.
Being that it's a low key, order at the counter type of place, Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken can be useful for all different kinds of situations, the most useful being the Late Night Eats situation. It's open until 2am, seven days a week. That's information you need to retain and put to use next time you're drunk and hungry.
Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken seems primed and ready to be reproduced and franchised all across the country. Whether that's the actual plan or not, we have no idea. America could only be so lucky. Watch your back KFC. The Bromberg bros are coming for you."

",3.0,Bar Food,Distilled,4.9,"We're not sure what recent market research indicated that Tribeca desperately needed two more upscale bar food restaurants, but that's what the neighborhood got this summer, and they opened up right next door to each other. Michael White's ""supper club"" The Butterfly and this new ""American public house"" called Distilled are about two hundred yards apart, and they both serve pricey cocktails and simple food in a relaxed setting. I guess the locals around here like their food casual and their cocktails swizzled. Or at least that's what these two restaurants are hoping. Also, why did that sound dirty?
We've visited Distilled a few times now and we're not particularly fond of it. First of all, the room is massive. This place feels less like a ""public house"" and more like an ""airplane hangar."" Second, there always seems to be a little bit of chaos going on, most likely as a result of trying to feed a full airplane hangar worth of patrons at once. The restaurant is usually packed full of people, most of whom are after a plate of chicken wings, thanks to a few local hype machines that called them out as the best in New York within a few days of the grand opening. We both tried them on separate occasions and can't say we were all that impressed.
Honestly, nothing that we've eaten at Distilled has impressed us, and we're at the point where we're definitely not going to keep coming back until something does. The restaurant has no vibe, and other than the drinks (when can we stop being so impressed with mixology?) we can't really find any redeeming qualities. What does it mean when one of the most popular things on the menu is the free popcorn they give every table? Probably that you should have dinner next door."

Mission Chinese is from San Francisco, the chef has an ombre, and Food & Wine Magazine thinks it's really, really cool. Han Dynasty is from Philadelphia, and nobody thinks anything from Philadelphia is cool.
Otherwise, there are some similarities at play between these two establishments, namely in the fact that both serve Sichuan cuisine, and both also showed up in New York with an extremely dedicated following. We were initially brought to Han Dynasty with a friend who is a hardcore enthusiast of the restaurant from his days in Philly, to the tune of eating the stuff about twice a week. I'm gonna guess that's not the best idea nutrition-wise, but that's the level people take it to with Han Dynasty. The people that love this place love it so hard that it's not even like they're eating anymore - it's like they're using.
Now that I think about it, our visits to Han Dynasty have actually been a lot like going with someone to a flophouse where they do drugs with a bunch of strangers. It's a mess of a restaurant with bare walls, people all over the place, and seemingly no one in charge. The staff seems to know many of the patrons by name, just like a dealer pretends to be a customer's best friend to buy some good will when things go wrong. And at this point, things go wrong a lot in this restaurant. We had a mishap of some sort during each one of our dinners, usually with our order being screwed up. We also noticed some distinct consistency issues when ordering the same dish on different visits. But we also found that we didn't really care too much. Why? Because the food is so good. The Dan Dan Noodles here are the single best example of that dish that we've ever had. The Dumplings in Chili Oil are incredible. The Hot Pot is tongue-numbing Chinese food euphoria. At some point it doesn't matter that you waited an hour to sit down or that your waiter brought over the wrong food. You just want more of this stuff.
Ultimately, that's all that matters for Han Dynasty. To use another drug reference that we learned in Breaking Bad (and not on the streets, Mom), this place just has a really good ""product"" that people want. Yes it has some flaws, and no, it will never be cool like Mission Chinese. But people will be lining up for the goods regardless. You can count us among the newly hooked users. So please keep an eye on us, and step in if things start to get out of control."

",2.0,BBQ,Morgan's BBQ,7.8,"Over the last five years, the barbecue scene in NYC has improved dramatically. We're no longer the laughing stock of the league, stuck with Rub, Daisy May's, and Hill Country representing our formerly smoker-less city. We'll never be Texas, Memphis, or The Carolinas, but thanks to a badass group of relocated expats and some learnt, dedicated locals, NYC BBQ has gone from being a joke to nationally renowned very quickly. Ladies and gentlemen, a former pit-master at the single greatest BBQ brisket establishment of all time, Austin's Franklin BBQ, is now smoking meats on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn. We have officially arrived.
Morgan's is one of the new kids on the BBQ block, generating all kinds of excitement and buzz right now. While it may be located in the heart of Brooklyn, only a couple blocks from Barclays Center, its indoor/outdoor set-up embodies a Texan aura. As we mentioned, Morgan's original pit-master, John Avila, who has since moved on, ran the smoke show for the royal Franklin family for a couple years in Austin. He's now moved north and brings with him a lifetime of meat smoking, as he started at a young age, being mentored by his father at their families restaurant. As if you needed another reason to check it out, rumor has it Morgan's is even shipping up University Of Texas girls to wait tables too. OK, we made that up. Regardless, Morgan's is a summer guide shoe-in, as the excellent outdoor patio is filled with ample seating and will certainly be a popular hangout spot in the warm weather months.
Texan vibes, a Franklin association and fun in the sun be damned, it'd be all be for nothing if the food sucked. Thankfully, that's not the case at all. We liked the 'cue a great deal. We can't wait to come back for more fatty brisket, pulled pork, beef sausage, and pork ribs, which were among our favorites. We also applaud the idea of smoked turkey. You rarely see that on a BBQ menu, but when done right, smoked turkey holds its own. Our one complaint is that the food temperature. None of our meats seemed hot enough, they fell in between lukewarm and warm, which isn't good. Still though, you can taste the love that goes into this stuff, and we're very lucky to have Morgan's in the mix."

",3.0,American,The East Pole,8.0,"Something is happening to the East 60s. It’s as if the neighborhood is stirring, slowly waking up from a deep sleep that it’s been in since, well, the ’60s. Here’s a little bit of history for you. Did you know that this part of town used to be home to the hottest singles scene in New York City circa 1965? And that the epicenter of that scene was the original T.G.I. Friday’s, on 63rd and 1st? Seriously. The pill had just been invented, and for some reason, people were flocking from all over the city to Friday’s for a cocktail and some casual sex, and maybe an appetizer sampler. Imagine that. There was a point in time where you could pick up something other than heart disease at T.G.I. Friday’s.
Clearly, times have changed, as this neighborhood is mostly inhabited by a bunch of rich people that probably remember those days. Rich people and me. I’ve actually been an East 60s resident for nearly seven years, and while I love it for many reasons, the dining and nightlife options are not among them. Other than a few key standbys, this area for the last several decades has basically consisted of places that are either marginally better or marginally worse than China Fun. That’s our median. Or at least it was.
Things appear to be improving around here when it comes to restaurants, and the most important improvement just came via a partnership between The Fat Radish and the Martignetti brothers, whom you probably know best for Brinkley’s. The two entities have teamed up to essentially bring The Fat Radish uptown, with some of the sceney sensibilities that the Martignettis are known for. We’ve been to The East Pole a few times now and can tell you that they hit the nail on the head. This place is exactly the youthful shot in the arm that this area needed. The vibe is decidedly downtown, the food is as good as it is at The Fat Radish, they stay open until 3am, and the staff are all very nice, or at least they are for now. These Upper East Side ladies can be brutal. On our last visit, we saw a few of them drinking white wine outside and chain smoking cigarettes, just looking for someone to talk down to. 
As a matter of fact, part of the challenge for the East Pole will be whether or not they can maintain some of the downtown appeal to this place, rather than surrendering it completely to the Real Housewives of You Aren’t On TV. And even in the best case scenario, this restaurant alone won’t resurrect the nightlife scene in the East 60′s again. At least it’s a step in the right direction. And a place for me to eat."

",2.0,Diner,Viand,7.8,"When was the last time you went to a diner? A real diner, not some kind of diner-inspired restaurant concept in Noho that serves avocado toast. It's been a while, right? Well then sit down for a minute, because it's time we had a talk.
I am going to assume that you've been in New York for a significant amount of time. Actually, let me be more precise and venture a guess. You moved here about four years ago, right after college. You've got a pretty good job, some Ikea furniture, and a handful of friends that you predominantly communicate with an Emoji. You go out to dinner three nights a week, and you probably do brunch once or twice a month. Forty percent of these meals take place in the East Village. Kale is present in nearly all of them. You are, at least in Immaculate Infatuation terms, an average New Yorker. And you're missing the whole point.
Back in the olden days, the restaurant scene in New York was much different. We don't need to fully explore the history of dining for the purposes of this discussion, but let's just say that there was a time when the most intriguing pastry-hybrid in the city was a black and white cookie, and if you wanted one, you went to your neighborhood diner. As a matter of fact, when you wanted pretty much anything that wasn't cooked by a French guy or served with chopsticks, you went to your neighborhood diner. And when you showed up, they probably addressed you by name. They probably also knew exactly what you were going to order. When was the last time that one of the hostesses at Vinegar Hill House addressed you by name? Never, unless it's to tell you that the wait will be another two hours.
When I say that you're missing the point, I mean that we've all apparently forgotten about the great New York City diner, and what it means to a community. We're more interested in the new hot spots - places that we visit once or twice right after they open and then never go back to. But the New York experience is really about making this gigantic metropolis feel smaller. We're really all just looking for a few comfortable places with familiar faces in them to retreat to after a long day. Viand is one of those places. This diner on Madison Avenue has been serving its neighborhood regulars since 1976, and it also happens to have one of the best turkey club sandwiches you can find anywhere. But that's not what makes it great. What makes Viand great is the fact that every time you eat there, you'll see someone walk in that the staff knows by name. Maybe it's the stately older woman that they refer to as ""Abuelita."" Maybe it's the dad with his kids coming in for a milk shake. Or maybe it's one of the several women who frequent this place that look like a mix between Hilary Clinton and a very expensive hooker (this is the Upper East Side after all). Regardless, it's awesome, and it makes us happy that places like this still exist. So stop missing the point, and go to your local diner every once in a while. You probably need to take a break from the kale anyway."

Oh, so you mean they serve mediocre food five days out of the week, but then they totally step up their game for poached eggs and scones? F*ck, we should go.
That's pretty much the story with Cafe Colette. This place is always in the mix when people talk about brunch in Williamsburg. Not that we ourselves are participating in that conversation, but we do know a handful of 24 year olds. They love brunch.
From what we can tell, Cafe Colette does seem to do weekend daytime food pretty well, and they also have a very good espresso and coffee bar situation set up. But what about the other five days of the week? Judging by the several meals we've now had here, this place is very average. Average except for one thing. The burger. I know what you're thinking - every place like this has a good burger. They are, after all, a staple of brunch menus. But this one is seriously good. Best in Brooklyn good. Ready for the kicker? They do a great plate of brussels sprouts too. And would you be surprised to learn that they also have a very good cocktail menu? Didn’t think so. Isn’t this exciting?"

We weren't around back in those days, so we're not going to be the ones to give you a detailed history of the place. But if you're looking for a really good read that will definitely make your meal at The Odeon more interesting, take in all six pages of this Vanity Fair article before dinner. Let's just say...we missed all the good stuff.
As for the current state of affairs at The Odeon, it's still a beloved fixture of the neighborhood. It may not be the same downtown destination that it was thirty years ago, but they still serve very respectable bistro food and stiff drinks, and brunch is always reliable. But there's really nothing on this menu that's going to blow your mind. As a matter of fact, I suspect that this restaurant probably never served particularly spectacular food, but traded more on the currency of having Andy Warhol and John Belushi amongst their list of notable regulars. I guess when those people are hanging around your restaurant, all you really need to serve is a good plate of fries, and maybe some good drugs. Not that we'd know anything about that. These days in Tribeca, you're more likely to stumble into a Patagonia store than you are a good time. At least The Odeon is still around to remind us of what we missed."

",2.0,Ramen,Jinya Ramen Bar,4.5,"Maybe there's a reason why D. Chang hasn't unleashed Momofuku Noodle Bars all over the country yet. Maybe it's because Momofuku is simply too good for the rest of America to appreciate. With that in mind, it's no wonder that Jinya is the ramen brand set to franchise like crazy, because this place is as average as they come. Which means the dude in head to toe Aeropostale is going to love it.
A ramen import by way of Los Angeles and Canada, yes I said ramen from Canada, Jinya's 2013 expansion plans include NYC, Vegas, Seattle and Houston for starters. Us spoiled New York ramen fiends shouldn't be getting overly excited though. Unless, of course, you enjoy slurping noodles to the sweet sounds of Katy Perry and the Black Eyed Peas. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a big addition to the noodleless West Village, Jinya is a ramen bar that belongs at the mall. Right in between Rainforest Cafe and Panda Express.
While Jinya Ramen Bar is super slick looking, it also feels extremely formulaic and completely soulless. Yup, that's mean, but that's the kind of treatment you receive from Immaculate when your soundtrack features Top 40 hits from five years ago. I'm sure their origins are rooted in Japan somewhere, but nothing about this place feels authentic at all. Which would be fine if the food was great, but being that it's not, it just makes it easy to hate on. Jinya is by no means terrible. The ramen is fine, just lacking in any kind of bold flavor. We tried three different bowls, none of which gave us the salty satisfaction ramen usually gives us. The buns are a bummer too, violating the cardinal bun rule of too much bun.
Maybe the West Village is just desperate for ramen. Maybe everyone just left their Aeropostale at home. Maybe we're just too spoiled. Regardless, judging by the crowds, Jinya's NYC outpost seems to be doing just fine. All we can tell you is to temper expectations. There is way better ramen to get into in this city."

Let's demonstrate with a hypothetical: Gyros. New Wave bands of the 80's. Devo the Greek's House of Meat Wraps. How does a Spicy Morrissey with a side of tzatziki sound? Pay me.
OK, so maybe it's not that easy, but Glaze Teriyaki certainly makes it seem that way. We stumbled across this place one of our recent Midtown lunch excursions, having no idea it's actually the third location in New York, with another that just opened in San Francisco. The only reason we found out about Glaze was because we walked by and noticed the line of people out front and a sign on the door that read, ""Our teriyaki has been blessed by monks and Tupac."" Obviously, we jumped in line.
Glaze Teriyaki is ""Seattle-style"" teriyaki, which probably means nothing to you unless you're from Seattle or really well versed in teriyaki. We are neither of those things, but we can now tell you that Seattle-style teriyaki is pretty f*cking delicious. It's also cheap and seems relatively healthy, or at least that's what the presence of brown rice would lead us to believe. Then again, you could lay a piece of pudding-filled birthday cake over some brown rice and we'd be eating it all proud like we made good choices today. So maybe don't take our word on the nutritional value of this stuff. But do take our word on the fact that Glaze is a fantastic addition to your lunchtime rotation if you work in Midtown. We have been a few times now and really like everything we've had - even some of those ""healthy"" options. We even tried some teriyaki tofu the other day. What, you're surprised?

",4.0,Japanese,Sushi Of Gari Tribeca,7.8,"Is it really necessary for us to review another outpost of Sushi Of Gari considering our love for this place is well documented? Probably not. However, we just dropped a truck load of cash at the Tribeca outpost, so we’re definitely going to need a review out of this deal. Apologies if we sound like a broken record here, but, when it comes to omakase in NYC, Gari remains one of the best. And speaking of the much maligned sushi scene of NYC, it can actually be pretty damn impressive. If you’re rich.
For us, there are few culinary pleasures in life that exceed sushi bar swagging at Gari, watching an old master fish sculptor slice up some heavenly creations destined for our bellies. Sushi at Gari isn’t simple, and it certainly ain’t cheap, but the inventive ideas they come up with are on par with intricate entrees at a five star restaurant, all executed on a small pieces of raw fish. We only do it once in a blue moon, because if we went as much as we wanted to, we’d be broke.
While we’ll always hold Gari in high regard, the quality of their newer reproductions has been slipping a bit. While we were sad to see strange, pre-packaged Gari sushi available down in The Plaza Food Court, we were less bummed about its recent Tribeca annex. After all, it makes sense. Fishing in the sea of deep pockets is smart money. Unfortunately, this Gari location is our least favorite yet. The downstairs dining room is completely sterile, and while the upstairs sushi bar is serving up their signature deliciousness, it just doesn’t feel the same. That, and the toilet isn’t as high tech as the one on the UES. We’ve come to expect greatness not only from your fish, Gari, but from your toilets.

It’s more of a bar with food than it is a restaurant, but the expansive menu, including weekend brunch, makes it worthy of a full review. This place is tailor made for the mid-20′s crowd that now lives on the LES and populates B&W on the regular. You know, the ones that move down here once they’ve realized they’re still single and too old for Murray Hill. It’s a useful spot to hang with friends, get drunk and eat some above average bar food. The menu has some surprises, and isn’t too typical. It’s all a little pricy for what it is, which certainly affects the rating here. None of the plates are exactly photo worthy, but much of the food tastes a lot better than it looks.
As we are all aware, there are not a lot of great places to eat AND watch a game. What’s most impressive about Boulton & Watt and what makes it super useful is its ability to be a sports bar when it wants to be. They camouflage a bunch of flat screens all around the room, which are usually off and not an eyesore. Tasteful TV placement is a tough line to toe, yet they do it well here. Our first time through, we were pissed because we were under the impression there were no TV’s, and thinking this would be the perfect local spot to watch games. Our bad.

",3.0,Fusion,Khe-Yo,6.4,"We were really excited for a second when we hit Marc Forgione's new restaurant in Tribeca, Khe-Yo. At first, it seemed like this place was going to be our very own Little Serow, a much celebrated Northern Thai restaurant in Washington D.C. that is our undisputed favorite dining destination in that city. We've been aching for a spot like that in this town - something a bit more traditional and authentic than say, Kin Shop, but with the same ability to wow us with new and creative ways to present the flavors. Unfortunately, Khe-Yo only got us half way there. Which, if we're talking about D.C., would geographically be Delaware. So yes, Khe-Yo is Delaware.
Generally, we liked this restaurant. It's a nice place with nice people (as is Delaware), and we really loved a lot of the food that we ate, mostly in the first half of our meal. Which brings us to our overall point. Khe-Yo feels like something of a half measure. The beginning of this menu is everything we love about the food from Southeast Asia. It's shareable, full of flavor, and often best eaten with your hands. The Crunchy Coconut Rice and Duck Laap salad particularly blew our minds, and the Pork Belly and Shrimp Crispy Rolls didn't suck either. And then we got to the entrees. Maybe it's because Laotians don't really eat $33 plates of Black Bass, or maybe it's just that they haven't quite figured out the formula in the kitchen, but for some reason the entrees in this restaurant really run into problems. Our Pork Jowl Red Curry was so salty that it was inedible, and even if it wasn't, the pork jowl bits were more like rubbery little fat nuggets than they were delicious pig face meat. The same goes for our sodium-crusted Lemongrass Spare Ribs that we could barely finish due to concerns for our blood pressure. The Bell & Evans Grilled Half Chicken wasn't bad, though it also wasn't particularly remarkable, and the Chili Prawns were about on par with any above average shrimp dish in Chinatown. Thank god for sticky rice.
We're certainly not experts on this kind of cuisine, but our ultimate assessment of Khe-Yo is that they should have gone all the way. It feels like the chef felt compelled to create a menu of entree dishes to appease the locals, rather than fully committing to the idea of many small dishes to be shared at the table and eaten with glorious handfuls of glutinous rice. But who knows? Maybe a half measure is exactly what this Tribeca neighborhood wants. Maybe they're happy with a mere taste of these ethnic flavors, so long as they come packaged in a familiar dinner-time format. Either way, it looks like we're going to have to keep making trips to DC. Or maybe Laos. Is there a bus that goes there?"

But just in case you were wondering where one might find such an opportunity, look no further than Osteria Cotta on the Upper West Side.
Let's quickly review why this place sucks so bad. First of all, the food is mediocre at best. It's a menu full of unremarkable pizzas and pastas, and f*cking truffle fries. Wanna know how to tell that a restaurant has no original ideas? When they put truffle oil on something and then take pride in telling you how good it is. The service here is also suspect, in that it's pretty much a bare minimum approach to each table. You'll probably see your waiter twice, and he might not make eye contact with you either time.
But the worst thing of all is what's going on in terms of ambiance at Osteria Cotta. This is a spacious, rustic wine bar that inexplicably plays the biggest hits from Z100 four years ago inside the restaurant, and the music is turned up so loud that it's annoying from the street, let alone a seat at the bar.

It's a great escape from the drag of a busy Tuesday - an escape to dumplings.
That background on how we ended up here is important, because upon first inspection, the Radiance Tea House looks like a place that your estranged ""free spirit"" cousin would probably hang out in. You know, the one who skipped college to follow Phish around for a decade before settling in some small town in Arizona where everyone has their own tee pee. You don't have any cousins like that? I guess that's what growing up in Colorado gets you. Anyway, once you really survey the situation at Radiance, you'll realize that it's way less eccentric than all that, and is really just a great little place to get some grub, drink a pot of tea, and maybe peruse a text about Buddhism. We find ourselves in here from time to time to do exactly that - except for the Buddhism part. I figure if I'm too ADD to read, I'm probably too ADD for that religion.

",4.0,Italian,Quality Italian,7.8,"From the team that brought you Quality Meats, welcome to Quality Italian, or as we like to call it, Midtown’s Carbone.
Now, there are probably at least a few of you out there that scoff at the suggestion that a restaurant anywhere near Midtown could be compared to a fixture of the downtown “scene” like Carbone, and to that we say, good luck out there being the coolest person ever, and also stop using the word “scene.” You sound like an asshole. We’ve actually heard from a few people that we trust (and who are pretty cool) that they prefer the old school Italian grub here to the stuff at Carbone, and that’s got our attention. So does this chicken parm pizza that everyone is talking about. More on that shortly.
After a few visits, we’re not ready to say that we like this restaurant as much as the one that they are most definitely taking some cues from. But we do like it a lot. We like the food, we like the service, we like the space, and we even like the “scene,” which is far from stuffy, but still formal enough to function as a post-work or pre-theater destination for those eating in this area for that purpose. We’re also particularly fond of the small street-level bar and shop beneath the massive restaurant, which has a garage door that opens out to the sidewalk and serves drinks, snacks, sandwiches, and something called gelato cake.
But our favorite thing about Quality Italian is how they have managed to take this concept of the new classic Italian restaurant, complete with table-side preparations and waiters in bow-ties, and made it work by melding it with what they’ve done successfully down the street for so many years - a steakhouse. This place actually feels less like a new concept than it does an update on Quality Meats, with more pasta, some meatballs, and little touches like “gorgonzola dolce” that make a filet mignon sound vaguely more Italian. All in all, it works really well.
And then there’s the aforementioned Chicken Parmigiana for two, which is really just a giant meat pizza and has become something of a calling card for the restaurant. Let us be the ones to tell you that you don’t need to spend the $60 it’s gonna cost you to try it. We found it to be bland and uninteresting, and honestly, this place is better than that. Save your money for the pastas, any sea-born appetizer, and those vaguely Italian steaks instead."

But we’ve been eating here pretty much constantly since it opened, and it’s starting to become a problem. Apparently a daily bowl of hot pork fat and liquid sodium isn’t part of the ideal health plan.
For those of you who are more practiced in the art of self-restraint, this new Ippudo is nothing but great news. You don’t need us to tell you that this part of the city needs better restaurants, and having an Ippudo at your disposal for after work drinks and dinner or Pre-Theater Eats is a game changer. The most important question, though, is how this new location stacks up to its now legendary predecessor downtown. When it comes to the food, we find it to be essentially the same. There are some differences on the menu in terms of the small plates and non-ramen options, but everything we’ve eaten has satisfied like Ippudo should. The room is a bit smaller and certainly more sterile, but that’s to be expected - this is Midtown, and this part of the city is not zoned for cool restaurants. It’s a union thing.
But the best thing about this new Ippudo, at least for now, is that you can actually get in. We visited on a recent Saturday night, and the wait at 7:30pm was only about 30 minutes. By 9:00 it was free and clear. We don’t know about you, but we'll trade the aesthetic pleasures of Ippudo number one for the wait times at Ippudo number two any day.

For instance - please don’t invite me to a surprise birthday party three months before it’s scheduled to happen, thereby enslaving me to weeks upon weeks of watching what I say around someone who is way too old to be celebrating insignificant birthdays anyway. Congrats on turning 32, here’s a cupcake. Additionally, you probably don’t want to give me any sensitive information about the girl in your office who is totally sleeping with her boss, the fact that your roommate got an STD, or the cheat codes to BioShock Infinite. As a matter of fact, I don’t even want the code to the hallway bathroom at the doctor’s office. I just can’t be trusted not to share that information, either accidentally or because I don’t care.
Which brings me to Bohemian. This “secret” restaurant behind the Japan Premium Beef butcher on Bond Street doesn’t have a published phone number. You’re supposed to obtain it from a friend who has already dined in the restaurant, just as they do at the original location in Japan. It’s basically a marketing gimmick, and it’s one that always seems to work in New York. People love to feel like they have the hook up. So after hearing chatter about this place since it opened up back in 2009, we finally played the game, tracked down the number, and made it in for dinner. And as you might imagine, we felt the need to talk about it. Bohemian is amazing.
What impressed us the most about Bohemian is that it’s not impressive because it’s exclusive. Usually, these “hidden” or “private” restaurants are a huge let down, like when you actually get inside the Soho House and see that it’s nothing but a bunch of trust fund dudes and the least famous Jonas Brother hanging out together. Much to our surprise, the food is absolutely excellent here, and the environment delivers, too. And the key to it all is simplicity. The room is small and vibey and very relaxed, with couches and lounge chairs and low profile tables. It’s about as perfect as a Date Night restaurant can get, because it’s comfortable. As for the food, you might think a secretive place like this would serve some crazy sh*t like blowfish sashimi or live scorpion tacos. But instead, the best things to eat are a whole branzino with brussels sprouts and olives and Wagyu beef steaks from the butcher out front. There’s even a reasonably priced tasting menu at $55, and they were playing old school Phoenix for two hours straight during our dinner. Not bad.
So now that you know about Bohemian, all you have to do is figure out how to get the phone number. Good thing you’ve got a friend that’s bad at keeping secrets."

",3.0,American,Harding's,6.0,"God bless America. For she's provided us with many gifts, like freedom, and capitalism, and restaurants. And at Harding's in the Flatiron District, you can celebrate all of those things at once, by eating short ribs. This truly is the land of opportunity.
We've visited Harding's a few times now, and each time we're a bit taken a back by the size and scale of this place. It's like a Planet Hollywood that's been dedicated to the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt, and seems to typically be about as crowded as you might imagine that idea would warrant. Let's just say that the restaurant is equipped to feed the entire population of the original thirteen colonies at once, and yet is in absolutely no danger of ever having to do so. There are just too many tables, and not enough demand.
Don't get us wrong. Harding's is by no means a bad restaurant. It's actually pretty solid, and they've got a good bar and a nice staff that make the place more appealing than the food probably would on it's own. But it's just too big of a room. There's no sense of intimacy, and there's so much space that heading to the bathroom from your table is like packing up and heading west on the Oregon Trail. There's no guarantee that you're going to make it back, and you're probably going to lose someone along the way. At least it won't be from starvation."

",2.0,American,Sweet Chick,8.1,"Chicken and waffles aren't a duo we generally get excited about. Granted, we're not from the South, so it's possible the real thing has eluded us. Lazy attempts as ironic menu items around here have always left us feeling like the chicken and the waffle are two completely separate species, not meant to make sweet love in your mouth. But things done changed. Sweet Chick now has us thinking differently.
A recent addition to the corner of N. 8th and Bedford Avenue in central Williamsburg, Sweet Chick is our kind of neighborhood spot. It specializes in fried chicken and waffles, but it's not a one trick pony. There's a full menu of simple, yet well executed Southern eats, a fun cocktail list, and great selection of local beer on tap. It's the kind of spot we gravitate toward, with a unpretentious vibe, good people, and a communal atmosphere. Expect to be surrounded by lots of tattoos and old school Outkast. Like, the entire ATLiens record too, not just Ms. Jackson. Sweet Chick can also be utilized as simply a watering hole -a solid place to hang and booze with friends. The kitchen is open until 2AM, which makes it one of the best Late Night Eats options around, perfect for a post-show hang at Music Hall of Williamsburg.
We're not sure what the end game is here, but Sweet Chick has got the branding element to this whole niche food theme down. Think Meatball Shop, but for chicken and waffles. We'll assume expansion is inevitable, which is a good thing for all of us."

",3.0,Australian,The Musket Room,8.1,"There are times in life when you’re pleasantly surprised. Like when you decide to rent The Change-Up, assuming you’ll fall asleep thirty minutes into it and end up laughing your ass off throughout the entire movie. Or when you wind up at a restaurant that hasn’t received much fanfare, not expecting much, and having an incredible meal. Which is exactly the good fortune we fell into dining at The Musket Room.
The Musket Room is a new restaurant in Nolita from Chef Matt Lambert, whose resume includes the kitchens at PUBLIC and Saxon + Parole. Now with his own spot, Lambert continues to cater to the fashion friendly downtown crowd, however now he can truly cook his own food, and that’s a good thing. Lambert’s cuisine is inspired by his roots in New Zealand, and his dishes have a flair for the beautiful and the delicious. It’s unique, different and memorable. Serving sizes are definitely a bit on the small side, but that’s overshadowed by how unique and tasty everything is.
Interesting flavor and texture combinations litter a menu of impressive hits at The Musket Room. It’s an unassuming restaurant, but one that prides itself on excellent service and a serious Kiwi heavy wine program. On one of our visits, the sommelier saw us browsing the wine list and asked if we wanted to taste a couple. Of course we did. She brought over three glasses and poured us samples of a few different options for us to decide from. Those small touches go a long way towards creating a lasting first impression, and sets the table for a great meal.
The key to dining at The Musket Room is to get seated in the back room, which is easily one of our new favorite meal settings in NYC. It’s a nice big room, but not jammed with tables. There’s an airy vibe that overlooks a beautiful garden where they grow much of their greens and edible flowers. It feels like you’re in a rich person’s upstate escape house - not Manhattan. Pleasant surprises all around."

",3.0,Korean,Madangsui,7.4,"It seems like lately, all of the Korean food we’ve been eating has been of the “trendy re-interpretation” variety. Meaning restaurants that are either attempting to elevate Korean cuisine, or make sliders out of it. And we’re totally fine with that - we really like places like Hanjan and Danji and Momofuku Ssäm (still).
But every once in a while, we get a craving for a more traditional meal - one that only a trip to K-Town can satisfy. The only problem with that is that there are about a million of these restaurants within a five block Midtown radius, and to the non-Korean or inexperienced eye, they all look pretty much the same. And we are neither Korean nor particularly experienced.
Madangsui is a spot that we’ve visited a few times now, and while we’re certainly not experts in the field, we do know that we like it here quite a bit. The menu is big, and there are definitely some less-than-memorable things on it. But if you stick to a few of the key items that they do best, you should come away happy. For instance, you absolutely want to eat a seafood pancake. Those are incredible here. You’re obviously going to want to make use of the grill that sits in the middle of your table, so you’ll need some bulgogi and marinated short ribs for that. And you also probably ought to have a bibimbob or two for good measure. Add all of that up with the endless ban chan (side dishes) that come with the meal and a bunch of beers, and you’ve got a good night for four to six people laid out in front of you. Best Korean in K-Town? Who knows. But Madangsui definitely does the job when we’re in the mood for a Korean meal that doesn’t involve ramps."

Like when you were a kid on Halloween and you’d come home and eat your candy so fast that you’d throw up everywhere. Or the first day of college spring break, when you’d finally get to Panama City and then you’d throw up everywhere. You know...from the excitement.
Or when you go to a new restaurant and have a few great meals, and then proceed to drop a 9.0 rating on the place like it’s the gastro-pub version of Eleven Madison Park. Such was the case with our initial review of Allswell. Let’s just say that we got a little worked up.
Only ten other restaurants on Immaculate Infatuation have an equivalent or higher rating than our initial review of Allswell. And while this place is very good, subsequent visits have demonstrated that we might have gotten a bit carried away. The restaurant hasn’t necessarily declined in overall quality -Allswell is still putting out very good food - but the problem is that they change the menu daily, and things therefore become somewhat inconsistent. And when you’re talking about what sets a great restaurant apart from a legendary restaurant, consistency usually has a lot to do with it.
Ultimately, Allswell still remains one of our favorite dining establishments in Williamsburg, and we strongly recommend that you check it out for dinner if you haven’t yet. As a matter of fact, we’re pretty sure that lowering the overall rating on this place will also lower some expectations, and that’s a good thing. Then maybe you’ll catch it on a great night and have a 9.0 meal yourself. Just try to control your excitement. And do your best not to throw up."

",3.0,American,Thistle Hill Tavern,7.1,"Thistle Hill Tavern has a peculiar back-story. This restaurant initially launched in 2010 with a press release heralding the involvement of Fat Mike -lead singer of the legendary band NOFX - as partner and proprietor. Now, we have the utmost respect for Fat Mike, and NOFX, and punk rock or whatever, but let's be honest - with the current demographic that would even remotely care about his involvement (dudes in their thirties who peaked at seventeen), that kind of billing only matters if you're selling $15 tickets to a Hudson River concert cruise. A restaurant in this part of Brooklyn is a whole different story, as evidenced by the fact that the experiment was seemingly unsuccessful. The ownership team has since brought in Dale Talde of Top Chef fame to right the ship, and Fat Mike's headline has been reduced to a tiny callout at the bottom of the website that reads something like: ""Fat Mike was in a band, and here's his Wikipedia page.""
We never made it into the previous iteration of Thistle Hill Tavern, but have visited since Talde's involvement and can say that we like what we've seen so far. This is a classic neighborhood restaurant in every sense of the word, and it seems to fill a void in the area by being a simple and reliable standby for dinner and drinks and everything in between. One of the most telling things we noticed about Thistle Hill was the amount of people eating solo at the bar (more than two). That's a good indication that a restaurant is serving the neighborhood, and we can understand why people would want to come in here to eat a burger and read a book. The staff is nice, the food is good, and the drinks are too.
The only words of caution that we would issue would be to say that just because a ""Top Chef"" is involved, don't think that this is some kind of dining destination. For instance, if you live in Tribeca, you probably don't need to spend forty minutes riding on various trains just to have a meal here. You'll quickly realize that you came all that way to eat at a 2013 version of Walker's - and that's a compliment to Thistle Hill. If you want the true Top Chef bus tour experience, hit up Talde, Catch, or the trash cans out in front of Padma's Lower East Side apartment building. That woman throws away some delicious things. So we've heard."

",1.0,Burgers,Harlem Shake,7.5,"We realize that's it's a bit preposterous for The Infatuation to review new Harlem openings, while at the same time ignoring the salt of the local earth who've been at it for years. We're going to fix that. We promise to hit the glistening pavement hard. Get ready Amy Ruth and Sylvia, because we're coming for you. But first, let's do the Harlem Shake. Not the dance, the burger.
In their defense, Harlem Shake had picked out their name before it was a whole thing. They sort of stepped in sh*t, actually. There would have a bunch of excitement surrounding their hip new burger and shake spot regardless, but who's to turn down a little extra fanfare because of a name? All press is good press, it's just a shame Baauer didn't actually DJ the launch party.
Harlem Shake falls somewhere in between Johnny Rockets, Shake Shack, and Cafe Habana. It's a Quick Eats situation, with all kinds of cultural flavor. It's real flavor too, not the artificial kind. The owners all grew up in the area, are active in the community, and will be donating part of their profits to local charities. They're not cutting corners here either, they're using the good stuff in terms of ingredients; Pat LaFrieda meats in their burgers and Blue Marble ice cream in their shakes.
The burgers here are certainly unique. Harlem Shake takes a thin, double patty route, which is a different plan of attack than their peers. Their jerk sauce is excellent, and can be taken advantage of in the form of a chicken sandwich, hot dog, or fries. Also, as you would expect, the shakes are on point. We especially liked their namesake red velvet creation. The attention to detail at Harlem Shake really impressed us. We loved the TGI Friday's style buzzer that lights up when your food is ready, which purposely mimics the lights on the marquee. They've got solid beers on tap and serve Mexican Coke. Those little touches go a long way. We foresee Harlem Shake being a neighborhood staple for a years to come."

",3.0,Fusion,RedFarm,7.9,"Two years ago, we reviewed this buzzing new “dim sum” restaurant in the West Village, and decided that how much you will like it probably depends on what you think a dim sum dining experience should be. We’ve since been back a few times to check in on the joint, and RedFarm appears to be exactly the same as we remembered it - just with more hot people.
RedFarm is not the place for the person that shows up in Chinatown at 11am, ready to battle it out with 100 other people for the best shrimp dumplings and chicken feet from a rolling cart. This is not an authentic dim sum experience, and if you go in expecting that, you’re probably going to hate it. RedFarm is more suited for people who know dumplings better as “pot stickers”, and maybe have a little trouble with chopsticks. And it also now seems to be a popular destination for people who are famous or think they’re famous because they were in Hamptons magazine once. There’s a serious “see and be seen” situation going on in this tiny little restaurant.
Aside from the crowd observations, we’re happy to report that the food seems to have only improved at RedFarm, though we still like the things from the dim sum menu more than we like the entree-type dishes. The name of the game here is creativity, and the more creative things coming out of the kitchen tend to be the most satisfying. Order the Pac Man dumplings, the Katz’ pastrami egg roll, and the dumplings that look like stingrays, and you’re pretty much guaranteed to have a good meal. You’ll probably have a good time too, assuming you like to people watch. (You do)."

",4.0,American,Charlie Bird,8.7,"Charlie Bird means New York. Or at least that’s what the introduction on the restaurant’s website says. There’s a Beastie Boys quote up there, too, just in case you needed some extra convincing as to just how New Yorky this place is. Tough to argue with that.
Now, obviously, no one thing can truly embody the essence of New York City, except maybe the Empire State Building and our general distaste for other New Yorkers. From there, we each make something a little bit different of this place. Charlie Bird’s particular New York seems to be some kind of snappy downtown “cool,” mixed with an emphasis on good wine, good food, and hip-hop music (see: boom box artwork). That’s a New York we know well, and yes, I just said “snappy.”
Let’s forget about the concept for a moment and talk about what really matters. We love Charlie Bird. We love it a lot. This place already ranks among our favorite restaurants in town, and they haven’t been open for very long. Yes the food is excellent, and more on that soon. But what’s really got our attention are two things that these people already do better than almost anyone else: service and wine. On those fronts, Charlie Bird gets a 10.0. This is a somewhat casual restaurant with a five-star staff who are professional, nice, and really good at what they do. There are no white tablecloths here, but you will be attended to like there are. The wine list is similarly excellent and extensive, but treated informally. Want to try something? Cool. There happens to be a half bottle behind the bar they’ll pour from for you. Finished your glass before you finished your oysters? Before you even realize it, they’ll come top you off so you’ve got something left for the last few bites. That stuff goes a long way for us, and it will for you, too. It’s amazing how much good service matters.As for the food, most everything on the menu at Charlie Bird is fantastic. This is an American restaurant with some Italian influences, which is pretty much what every American restaurant says now so that they can put pasta on the menu. Upon first inspection, we actually thought this place might be L’Artusi with oysters, in which case we were going to have to commit ritual suicide out of respect to the chef and the knowledge that we had found true enlightenment. But it’s not quite that. Not yet. Charlie Bird is damn near perfect, but they have some slight consistency issues.
Which brings us back to the concept. Maybe the one true universal thing about this city is that we expect the best out of everything and everyone. Once we see the promise in something, we demand perfection. So yes, Charlie Bird is New York in the sense that it is both phenomenally good and also somehow not quite good enough. If they can fine tune their menu and improve on a few small things, this very well could end up being one of the highest rated restaurants on this site."

Like its predecessor/older brother (who it shares space with), ABC Cocina is all about seasonal ingredients, lots of vegetables, a giant menu of small plates, and an excellent and extensive cocktail menu. ABC Cocina isn’t reinventing the wheel, but what they are doing is serving some of the better Latin-inspired eats in this city - including an $8.50 taco we don’t hate ourselves for buying. The tacos at ABC Cocina are amazing - but the tacos are just the tip of the iceberg. There are a lot of ways to build an excellent meal here, as long as you’re prepared to pay for it - dinner here adds up quickly. 
Another thing you should be prepared for: a space that looks like it could be in Vegas. As in Le Cirque Vegas, not Guy Fieri’s Vegas Kitchen & Bar - but still, Vegas. It’s colorful, it’s sparkly, and the place definitely feels like a production, but one you actually want to have a birthday or fun date night in. 
So what’s next for the ABC Carpet & Home restaurant empire? We predict a third spot on the exclusive top floor of ABC Carpet & Home. A secret elevator, a roof cabana, monkeys, and a menu of finger food that can be eaten off lighting fixtures instead of dishware. You’re welcome for the idea, Jean-Georges."

",1.0,Greek,Souvlaki GR,7.3,"You might be asking yourself, what is Souvlaki GR, a seemingly unremarkable Lower East Side restaurant and food truck doing with a review on The Infatuation? Good question. We'd never considered eating here until we needed some late night grub after a show at Bowery Ballroom. But after wandering around for about twenty minutes at 10:30pm on a Tuesday and realizing that we'd never be able to wash the shame of San Loco off our souls, we wandered in to get our Greek on instead. And we've gotta say, these little souvlaki wraps are six bucks well spent.
Apparently souvlaki is a common street food item in Greece. It's basically a charcoal grilled meat, wrapped in a pita, with french fries stuffed inside. Yes, it's random. And yes, it's delicious. We took down a few different varieties, and went in on some of the other menu items after that. At the end of the day, we came away glad that we gave Souvlaki GR a chance. Is it going to change your life? Not even close. But it might save it in a pinch, when your only choice is this or the burrito place across the street that people throw up in from time to time.

Shaggy is awesome, and don't you even try and suggest otherwise. But ""Beautiful Girls"" is really hard to get past. I felt like I was having dinner at Sushi Samba in 2007.
Playlist critiques aside, Jin Ramen is a great little restaurant. Tucked under the 125th Street subway stop, this place turns out some really good ramen and (obviously) pork buns. I'd say it's a hidden gem, except it's well known amongst the Columbia community and Harlem locals, and is always busy. Each time we've visited, the dining room has been packed with a mix of students and neighborhood types, slurping up noodles and bumping to the sounds of Now Vol. 26.
Before you get ready to make a trip up to parts of New York City you've only seen from the inside of a Metro North car to eat some ramen, let us tell you how we think Jin stacks up to the other spots around town. This is definitely not Ippudo, and Totto Ramen beats it by a mile. But those are the best in town. If you like Hide Chan and Rai Rai Ken, you're going to love this place. It's not quite as authentic as either of those, but you'll definitely be satisfied and full of pork fat and sodium by the time you leave. Our biggest critique here is that we didn't love the noodles - they seemed a little tough and too much like the ones you get out of a package. But the broth, especially the spicy pork, is incredible.
Ultimately, Jin Ramen is absolutely worth a trip if you're looking to get some variety into your ramen rotation, and if you go to school at Columbia and haven't already hit this place, you need to do so immediately. I don't know what college is like these days, but ""eating ramen"" meant something entirely different at Colorado State University...and it usually involved filling up an electric kettle in the water fountain at 2am.

The Moti Mahal name is world-renowned for a few signature dishes from the Mughlai cuisine of India, including some of the best tandoori chicken you can find anywhere in the world. And thanks to a guy who owns a few other Indian restaurants in town, you can now find it on the Upper East Side. This location of Moti Mahal Delux opened in July of 2012, and they've already bagged a two-star review in the New York Times and built a loyal following among the Indian food enthusiasts in town.
We recently checked out Moti Mahal Deluxe for dinner, and despite not knowing much about the intricacies of Indian dining, we do know one thing - this place is really, really good. As a matter of fact, this might have been the best Indian food I've had in New York, and even though I don't eat it all the time, I do have functioning taste buds. Plus, we clearly aren't the only people that feel this way. The dining room at Moti Mahal is packed every night.
As we mentioned, there are some signature dishes here that you absolutely must order, but it's a huge menu, and you probably can't tackle them all in one sitting unless you're eating with a really big group. We'll cover some of the can't-miss items in the Food Rundown below, but our best recommendation is to follow the advice of your waiter and come here a few times to try different things.

Yes, we're probably going to review the new French place that some guy who isn't French just opened, just like everyone else that writes about restaurants will. But we also do our best to shine a light on some of the other really good establishments around town that don’t have PR teams pimping them out at every opportunity. Not every restaurant needs a press release.
Spicy Village is squarely in the latter category. Even though the New York food royalty is up on this restaurant (none other than Danny Bowien of Mission Chinese has admitted to borrowing recipes), we can promise you that they don’t have a PR team here. And we certainly wouldn’t recommend that they hire one. As a matter of fact, if they're going to spend money on anything, the first thing they should invest in is a dimmer switch for those fluorescent lights. Or maybe some plastic plates and cups, instead of styrofoam. In other words, this is not a place you want to take a date. Spicy Village is a restaurant for you and a few friends (they can’t accommodate parties larger than six) to eat some cheap, delicious Chinese food. And when we say cheap, we mean cheap - on our last trip here our group of five got stuffed for $10 per person, including tip. And you can catch a buzz for virtually nothing, since it’s also BYOB.
A few of the dishes are forgettable, but there are enough gems on this menu for us to recommend it wholeheartedly if you have a couple of adventurous friends to join you. Just bring some cash and a six pack, order a few dishes to share, and you’ll go home happy."

I had no idea that there were people on this part of the island, let alone noteworthy restaurants. In my mind, this neighborhood is basically a hospital and a bunch of empty apartments that you see on Craigslist for $1400 a month. Is that a murphy bed in that photo? Yes it is. Welcome to New York, kid. But ask any of your sushi-obsessed friends, and they’ll tell you - Tanoshi is the real deal.
That’s actually exactly the story that led us to Tanoshi Sushi. One of our own omakase-obsessed friends was raving about it a few weeks ago, and then it seemed like suddenly everyone we know was trying to get a reservation. And getting a reservation is no easy task. Tanoshi is only ten seats around a counter, and they do three seatings a night. It used to be that you had to come to the restaurant at 1pm to put your name on the list. Fortunately, they now accept online reservations.
Luckily it didn’t come to fisticuffs for us to eat here. After a full omakase meal with some appetizers and a few other extras thrown in, we’re happy to tell you that Tanoshi is as good as people say it is. This is one of the best sushi experiences you can find in New York City, and it comes at a better price than all of its contemporaries. The basic omakase starts around $95, which is pricier than it was a few years back, but also still more affordable than some of the city's other top spots. It also helps that it’s BYOS (bring your own sake).
Ultimately, Tanoshi is a restaurant that's worth checking out, especially if you’re one of those sushi obsessives we keep mentioning. We’re betting you’ll like this dingy little hole in the wall more than whatever your current overpriced go-to spot is. You may even find yourself coming up to York Avenue every once in a while just to eat here. Maybe you should scope out some real estate while you’re at it.

For that one day a year you decide to stay local and drink with co-workers, you could do a lot worse than outdoor tacos and margaritas at Tequila Park, the new seasonal restaurant on the second floor courtyard inside the Hudson Hotel.
Believe it or not, the tacos at Tequila Park are actually pretty damn good. They're a little bit tiny and a lot expensive, but that's to be expected in a place like this. The important part is that neither the tacos nor the margaritas are offensive, which is usually what you find when Midtown hotels start hopping on the latest dining trends. A word to the wise, don't roll up on Tequila Park expecting to eat or drink right when it opens at 4pm. Even on a Friday. We went last week on a half-day summer Friday, and were bummed that the tacos and tequila were not flowing until at least 4:45. They should fix that. People want to rage at the end of the week when the weather's warm. Or maybe that's just us.
At the end of the day, Tequila Park is definitely a useful option to have in the tool belt, as long as you're aware of what you're getting in to. This is a hotel. People in ridiculous outfits from both Italy and Iowa will be present. And it's expensive. $16 margarita expensive. If you're OK with all of that, you can surely have some open-air fun here. Especially if you have a corporate card."

",3.0,French,Little Prince,6.5,"Here’s what we can’t understand: How is it possible for someone to invest god knows how much money into opening a restaurant in New York - probably at least a million dollars - plus endless amounts of time and energy and emotional strife...only to end up staffing the place with a bunch of people who are f*cking baffled by the concept of serving food to humans?
This was a difficult review to write because we really wanted to love this place. Little Prince is a restaurant in Soho with so much promise, but every time we’ve wanted it to deliver, it’s let us down a little bit. Kind of like your really smart cousin who just can’t kick the weed and sleeps in his car every once in a while. You know he has greatness in him, but he just keeps disappointing you. And it always comes down to discipline. Our meals at Little Prince have been good examples of both those analogies.
On our first visit, we showed up for dinner on a Thursday night and had a really nice time eating some classic French bistro food, though we admittedly ordered very simple things and chalked up some of the small inconsistencies to a busy evening and early stage kinks. But then we returned a few weeks later on a quiet weekday night, and some of the true problems with this place shined through. Big problems. First of all, if there is one thing you can’t afford to screw up when you operate a French restaurant, it’s technique. You cannot serve a classic Lyonnaise-style frisée salad with so much vinaigrette that it could also sort of be a soup. Your simple roast chicken can’t be over-salted to the point that it almost tastes like jerky. And, most importantly, you can’t hire a bunch of waiters because they look cool, even though you could very easily convince them that “poulet” is the French word for swimming pool. That sh*t doesn’t work. Especially not in New York, and especially not with Balthazaar a few blocks away making you look bad. Don’t get us wrong - everyone at Little Prince is very, very nice. But you’d have to think they could find a few people that know not to fill a glass of wine to the very top like it’s the last one on earth. We like to drink and all, but we’d prefer not to need a straw.
I suppose what we’re getting at is that Little Prince would benefit greatly from a little bit (a lot) of fine tuning. This place has to figure out how to be a consistently good restaurant - from the kitchen to the wait staff -before it becomes a Soho go-to. There are too many other places nearby that offer the same experience, only better. See you at Raoul’s."

",3.0,American,James,7.9,"Have you ever sat down at a restaurant, read the menu, realized it’s full of the same stuff you see all the time, and assumed the meal that you’re about to eat is either going to suck or make you fall asleep? Well that’s what happened to us at James. Let’s run through the list of things available for dinner on any given night at this restaurant: Kale salad? Obviously. We were surprised it wasn’t served with some kind of ramp dressing. Pork belly? You know it. Roasted Chicken? Yup. Diver scallops? A “spring” pasta? Skate? Hanger Steak? All present. A burger? “The best you’ll ever have. It will change your life,” according to our server. You get the picture. We were of the mindset that unless Amanda Bynes came out of that kitchen high as f*ck and holding our food, this meal wasn’t destined for greatness. We were wrong.
The menu at James may not be all that original, but damn does it deliver the goods. This place reminds us of a Brooklyn version of Five Points, another restaurant that makes simple food seem exciting by making it taste really, really good. We actually enjoyed our meal at James so much that we decided to take our waitress up on that burger challenge...and had one for dessert.
The moral of the story here is that sometimes we just need to chill out. There are so many ridiculous dining trends to obsess over, but at the end of the day, it’s hard to beat well-executed, simple food. Thank you for the reality check, James. Now, who wants to go eat some bark and rocks at Atera?"

",3.0,French,Lafayette,8.1,"Hundreds of restaurants open in New York City every year, but only a few open with the press, fanfare, and excitement of a Hollywood blockbuster. At this point, Andrew Carmellini should be referred to as food game James Cameron. The dude goes big. Real big. He’s learned how to manipulate all the right loud-mouthed, powerful people into his corner and can roll out a restaurant better than anyone else in this city. Which is exactly why people have been talking about Lafayette, his new French monstrosity, for what feels like forever. We were in the minority when we dropped a so-so rating on Carmellini’s last big premiere, and we’ll continue to stand by our “good, not great” take on The Dutch. But this time around, we are happy to report that we’re fully buying the hype. Balthazar, you had a good 16-year run, but it’s time to step aside. Lafayette is now the quintessential French bistro of bustling downtown NYC.
Lafayette is an impressive place. It’s a massive restaurant in a space you’re probably familiar with, previously home to Chinatown Brasserie and Time Cafe. The huge room is populated with cushy booths as far as the eye can see, and there isn’t a bad seat in the house. And even with all that space, people are still spilling out of every crevice, drinking at the bar, having a croissant at the bakery in the front of the restaurant, or gathered in the downstairs cellar/private dining room/late night party lounge. It’s really crazy just to see how much there is going on in this place at any particular moment, and yet Lafayette keeps it’s sh*t together pretty well.Part of that successful execution seems to come because Lafayette is most certainly not cutting corners. Close attention is paid to every detail, and therefore the service is pretty much flawless. And even with all the bells and whistles here, it’s the simple things that impressed us the most. From the fresh-baked bread, to the french fries, to the butter lettuce salad, the basic things tend to be the most memorable. From there, scoping the massive menu here is kind of like browsing at your favorite store: you want to buy everything. Raw bar, meats and cheeses, crudo, tartare, handmade pasta, steak frites, bouillabaisse, rotisserie chicken for two, wood fired things, dessert... the options are endless. We were actually considering holding this review until we had eaten every dish on every menu. Not because it was necessary, but because we wanted to. Then after four trips and nearly $1,000 spent, we figured we’d stop right there. At least until one of us qualifies for a loan or something.
Lafayette isn’t going to be the best meal you have this year, but it’s definitely going to be one of the most fun. It’s a restaurant that’s Perfect For a lot of things, most of which involve scoping out Action at the Bar and Scoping Hot Girls/Guys. Recognizable celebrities amongst them, Lafayette is crawling with A-Listers. The beauty is that Lafayette treats you like one, even if you’re not. We have a feeling this blockbuster is going to continue to rake it in at the box office for a very long time."

",4.0,Japanese,Kajitsu,8.4,"Last fall, you might remember that we were very proud of ourselves for discovering Kajitsu, an incredible little East Village restaurant that we later found out had a Michelin star. Apparently we’re really good at discovering restaurants that already have Michelin stars. Have you guys heard about this place, Le Bernardin? It’s supposed to be awesome.
Just as we had finished dropping a very high rating on Kajitsu and remarking on what a special restaurant it is, they decided to close up shop and move to a larger space in Murray Hill. We can only assume it was all of that demand that we (and not the Michelin star) created. Either way, it rendered our old review pretty much useless, so a trip to the new Kajitsu was in order. Twist our arms.
We’re happy to report back that the food at Kajitsu is still exciting, interesting, and mind-bogglingly good. The menu is exactly the same: a four-course and an eight-course tasting menu, exemplifying the all-vegetarian practice of Shojin cuisine that originated in Buddhist monasteries. But now this restaurant is exactly where it should have been all along - in a space that properly reflects the fact that high level sh*t is happening all around you. The dining room is situated on the second floor of a townhouse, appointed with beautiful wood paneling, slate floors, and wood tables that look like they’ve been taken from the trunk of some mythical Japanese tree that understands human feelings. It’s a very “zen” room, but it is also unmistakably one where world-class food is being served. And we’re pretty sure that was exactly the point of the move. Kajitsu is such a special place that it deserves to be part of the conversation when it comes to essential New York restaurants. But it wasn’t ever going to get the recognition it truly deserves in its old location, a few steps below street level on a dirty block that ends at Tompkin’s Square Park. This new restaurant is a far more appropriate setting, geographically situated so that more of New York City is likely to experience it, and aesthetically designed so that they can acquire a few more of those Michelin stars. Which, mark our words, they will."

",2.0,Spanish,The Ten Bells,7.2,"Despite being an obvious pairing, wine bars that actually serve good food aren’t something we come across very often. There are certainly a couple of solid spots, but for every one that’s good, there are ten wine bars that most definitely suck. The Ten Bells, a longtime staple on the Lower East Side/Chinatown border, is a wine bar that’s been on our internal Hit List for a while. Although we’d been a couple times for drinks and oysters, we’d never rolled up with the intention of having dinner until last week. And you won’t find us doing it this way again.
Don’t get us wrong - we really like The Ten Bells. It’s a beautifully laid out space, with a nice bar, plenty of room for hanging, an incredible wine list made up entirely of organic and sustainable wines, and an oyster happy hour every damn day. But despite also having a large menu of mostly Spanish small plates, eating a full-blown meal here is unnecessary. The cooked food just isn’t very good. It is, however, still a very useful destination for a number of different reasons. Ten Bells is a great choice for a First/Early in the Game Date, where you can load up some oysters and a cheese plate and let the merengue music do the rest. It’s also a good pre-game spot before a meal at The Fat Radish, which is only a few blocks away. And if you’re seeing a band at Bowery Ballroom, this is an excellent option for a nightcap after the show.
If The Ten Bells wasn’t so Perfect For all of those things other than food, it’d get a significantly lower score. That being said, if you’re simply coming here for drinks and oysters, increase this rating at least an entire point. Oh, and bring the green. It’s cash only."

",3.0,American,Lavender Lake,7.9,"So technically, Lavender Lake is a bar. Actually, not technically at all - I have no idea what the technical specifications would be to discern a bar from a restaurant. Maybe one of those urinal troughs. It's probably safe to say that if your establishment has one of those, you aren't eligible for a Michelin Star.
Anyway, most people would tell you that Lavender Lake is a bar, and it's best known for having a large and awesome back patio. We actually ended up here recently for the sole purpose of doing some Summer Guide research (that's now the terminology we use for any time we drink beers and eat food outside), and were indeed impressed with both the indoor and outdoor spaces and the huge bar with many things to drink behind it. But what we found to be really remarkable about Lavender Lake is the fact that they have pretty damn good food too.
Ultimately, a place like this could very easily get by with slapping a mediocre burger and some finger foods on a menu, just to keep people sober enough to avoid falling into the nearby canal on their way home. But Lavender Lake seems to have put some care into curating a small but solid selection of bar snacks and entree sized plates. We absolutely loved the burger here, and some of the veggies we had were exceptional as well. And eating these things in the sun with an IPA on the side is not a bad way to spend a Saturday. Just be aware that this place gets really crowded by about 4pm on a nice weekend afternoon, so you might end up sitting with your burger on a bench near some plants, rather than at a real table. At least you know you won't have to pee in a trough when nature calls, because this is a restaurant. Or wait. It's a bar. What's the difference again?"

",2.0,American,Feast,7.3,"We're all familiar with the current New York restaurant trends - bakery by day/restaurant by night establishments, nose to tail cooking, never-ending tastings that cost as much as a small car. Feast is a new restaurant in the East Village that checks off a lot of those boxes. It is indeed a bakery during the day, and they most definitely embrace the ""whole animal"" mentality at night. But, as suggested by the name, this is not an expensive tasting menu situation. Feast is a meal meant to be shared amongst friends. You sit down and they load up your table, Thanksgiving style.
Feast's concept is fun. We definitely give them credit for mixing it up and taking a different approach to restaurant dining, and making it affordable in the process. The menu here consists of two different meals: a ""farmer's market"" vegetarian feast ($38 pp) and a ""nose to tail"" meat feast ($48 pp). There's also the option to order from a separate a la carte menu, just in case feasting isn't in your nature. In theory, it all sounds wonderful. But we took issue with the set up once we realized we had to abide by all kinds of rules. We don't do well with rules. Especially at the dinner table.
Here's the deal - feasts at Feast are made for two people, so you and your dining companion need to agree on either meat or vegetarian. You can't each order your own. If there's more than two and less than four of you, you're kind of f*cked. We had three people in our party and were frustrated by the fact that you can't order two meat feasts and one veggie feast. I begged and pleaded with our server, trying to reach a compromise by asking for single servings of select dishes on the veggie feast instead of the whole thing. But they weren't having it. She was visibly annoyed by our attempts too, which just made the situation worse. The most frustrating part is that each dish comes as a small duo. Would it really be that hard to stuff a singular eggplant with risotto and broccoli rabe instead of two? We think not. At any rate, we pushed on, and (menu gripes aside) we wound up enjoying our meal here. We were impressed with the imagination on display in dishes like the Oxtail Steak n' Eggs and the Lamb Shank Lasagna. It was also nice to have a huge table of food to eat from at your leisure, along with a reasonably priced and well curated beer and wine list to drink from. No single thing that we ate absolutely blew our mind, but this is definitely a restaurant we'd come back to, especially when we need a place for a Big Groups meal...as long as we've got an even number of people.
Nose To Tail Lamb Feast

Carpaccio
Razor thin slices of raw lamb are wrapped around honey crisp apple strips, drizzled with almond shavings and served with a delicious and spicy cognac mustard. The portion size is tiny, but the flavor is large.Merguez Stew
This was our favorite dish of the appetizer feast - a quail egg sitting in the middle of a tomato and lamb stew. It tasted like breakfast, which seemed to be a bit of a theme here. I guess that's what happens when you double as a pastry shop during the day. We're not complaining.Shepherd's Pie
Conceptually, this was really cool. It's a personal pastry of sweet potato pie, with a delicious square of lamb belly on top. But while it looked and sounded great, but it wound up being two separate components that just didn't work well together. The lamb belly was delicious, but it just kind of sat there on top of the dry, unforgiving pie.Roasted Pepper Salad
Sliced roasted peppers in a rich French onion sauce (soubise). This is sort of a sloppy mess, but it has all kinds of flavor. We liked it.Lasagna
The most impressive dish of the night. This lasagna is a wide, thin layer of pasta, wrapped around lamb shank, wrapped around goat cheese, and topped with broccoli rabe. This is different. This is interesting. And this is delicious.Rack of lamb
Let's call this good, not great. Our lamb was a little dry, and there was so much herby crust that it actually detracted from the flavor of the meat. At least it photographed nicely.Potato Gratin
Potatoes and cheese. Obviously good.Fricasse Of Winter Vegetables
Also known as a brussels sprouts salad with pearl onions and butternut squash. This ended up being one of our favorite dishes at Feast. ""Butter To Flour""
Dessert was insanely delicious here. It was essentially a sweet pizza with pear and maple walnuts on top, and a side of bourbon and lightly sweetened cream to add to the goodness.
A La Carte Menu

Steak N' Eggs
Hello insane breakfast for dinner. This was crazy in the best way possible. Shredded oxtail, on top of soft toast with a fried egg and béarnaise sauce. Incredible.Smoked Salmon
Yikes. This was terrible. The salmon was served as a filet and was nearly raw and kind of cold. And the apple fennel slaw was soaked in a not-so-tasty cider. No thanks.Chicken N' Dumplings
Big chunks of chicken are paired with a ""liver gnocchi"" and crispy pieces of chicken skin for added crunch. It's a nice use of many different chicken parts, but we probably wouldn't order this again."

",3.0,Mexican,Añejo,7.0,"Añejo Tequileria is one of the best restaurants in New York, assuming you’re either 1) on a diet, 2) looking for a second dinner, or 3) just had your stomach stapled. We say that because while it's pretty good, the food here isn't really the focus. The menu is actually quite short - there are many more pages of tequila options than there are things to eat. We found that to be a bit odd for a Top Chef-helmed restaurant.
Añejo is the brainchild of season who-knows-what contestant, Angelo Sosa. He was the guy that didn't win, but the guys hated and the girls loved. Or maybe the girls hated him and the guys loved him. Who can remember anymore. You get the point. You also might remember Angelo from the first establishment he opened after his stint on the show, Social Eatz, which has since closed...probably because of the Z. We liked that restaurant, and there are some things we like about Añejo too, even though its food offerings are a bit limited. As we said earlier, what is on the menu here is pretty good. But they also take the “small” in “small plates” really seriously. We almost had to start a new category called “Perfect For: Tiny Servings” for this review. So if you come here starving and looking to stuff your face with Mexican food until you can’t walk, know that you’ll have to order just about everything they offer, and are likely to end up with a bill as big as the one you get from Time Warner Cable every month by the time you're done. But if you’re just looking for a couple good tacos and a killer tequila selection, this is your spot. And the margarita that the Village Voice called the best in NYC last year? Yeah, it’s pretty damn good, and you’ll get more than three sips out of it. The rest of their tequila-based cocktails are worth trying too.
The only problem that we have with Añejo other than the price/food ratio is the space itself. It’s always full and the crowd is usually attractive, but the tables are so tightly packed that every seat in the place might as well be at a communal table. That's good for creating a lively atmosphere and a few opportunities for eavesdropping, but you don’t have nearly as much space as you’d expect to when you’re spending $14 on a plate of two tacos. Particularly all the way out here on 10th Avenue. Añejo could be a great neighborhood hang if they dropped the prices a bit and got rid of a few tables. As it is, this is a better place for drinking than eating."

We don’t tend to speak in absolutes, and we don’t typically like jacking up your expectations for a meal by telling you it’s the number one best anything. But we have no problem making the statement we did today about Speedy Romeo. Why? Because places like this are what keep us going. We love nothing more than discovering a true neighborhood restaurant, and then finding that the food in that restaurant is also incredible. There is also nothing better than when you can tell that the people who frequent that restaurant really feel like it’s partly theirs, just because they live nearby and the staff is nice to them when they walk in the door. We certainly felt that way after a few visits, even though it took us 45 minutes and three subways to get there. That’s what’s going down at Speedy Romeo.
If you’ve heard anything about Speedy Romeo or done a little bit of research, it’s pretty likely that you got the impression that this is another Brooklyn pizza joint. You wouldn’t be entirely wrong about that - they most definitely make pizzas here, and their pizzas are awesome. But what really blew us away about this place was the rest of the menu, the entirety of which is cooked over wood flames. You see, when Speedy Romeo’s chef and owner decided to convert this old auto body shop into a restaurant, they decided not to put in any gas lines. So there are no stoves or convection ovens in the kitchen. There is only fire. And chef Justin Bazdarich, a guy who trained under Jean Georges, knows what he’s going with it. The Kansas City Strip Steak here is one of the best steaks we’ve hand in recent memory. The burger is excellent. And yes, those pizzas that everyone talks about are very good, too. As a matter of fact, everything we have eaten at Speedy Romeo has thoroughly impressed us. So much so that they have us talking in absolutes. Put it on your Hit List and make the trip.

For the price and the quality, you can't touch this (that was fun, right?). It's a restaurant that belongs in the ""best of"" conversation when discussing NYC's top tier of lower end sushi spots. And we have you to thank for turning us on to it. Some friends who lived in the 'hood who used to swear by it, and it was also the venue for NSieges' winning photo in our #NemoBites Instagram Challenge. So that's neat.
It turns out that Momoya has a serious cult following outside of just people that we know in real life and a few that we have met over the internet. We recently went for dinner and got there as the soon as doors opened, and within thirty minutes every seat was taken and a wait began to pile up. I guess people are smart. Despite a plethora of sub-par sushi options in the area, they seem to know how to sniff out the highest quality fish. And though Momoya might not be home to the best sushi in all of Manhattan, they certainly do a good job of focusing on the basics while keeping a few popular tricks up their sleeve. One of those tricks is this moderately sloppy yet also insanely delicious spicy tuna crispy rice, which happens to be incredible. The sushi and sashimi are solid here too, and if you're careful, you can get out with a reasonable tab on your hands. Just go easy on the Sapporos."

",2.0,Japanese,Ootoya,7.3,"Otooya is basically the Japanese version of the Cheesecake Factory. We mean that in the nicest way possible, because the food here doesn’t suck. But this restaurant is a huge chain in Japan, and they have an enormous menu that’s a bit daunting (though not laminated, thank god). So it’s the easiest comparison to make. There's also a big host station at Ootoya, where you will inevitably be informed of a one hour wait and asked for your phone number so they can call you when you're table is ready. It's essentially a step short of handing you one of those blinky buzzer things. And some crayons.
Eventually, you'll be called upon to return to the Ootoya Factory (usually much sooner than that hour wait you were quoted), and you’ll be guided into a huge, two-level space and greeted by a friendly hello from the staff – all of the staff, at the same time, loudly. You will then sit down and realize that this is one of the few restaurants in New York (and certainly the only one at which you can spend less than $20 per person for dinner) where the tables are far enough apart that they don’t have to be pulled out to sit down, and where you won’t hear every word of the conversation next to you. We’re quite not sure how they manage to have that much space at this price point, but we didn’t ask any questions. We’re not trying to anger the Yakuza.
On each of our trips here we were the only white people in the restaurant, which we usually take as a good sign for the quality and authenticity of the food. And it was. Though there are better versions of some of these dishes on the menu at other Japanese places in town, there’s no place that has such a wide, consistent selection. We tried everything from the noodles to the sushi to the pork, chicken, and beef dishes, and it was all delicious and satisfying. You can order the main courses a la carte or with “set” dishes of miso soup, pickles, and egg custard for a couple bucks more. Fair warning: although the egg custard looks like flan, it is in fact not flan or any other sort of sweet dessert. If you dig in expecting something cold and sweet, you will be unpleasantly surprised. Other than that sole miscommunication, the wait staff is extremely helpful. And that’s a good thing, because if they weren’t we would have sat there paging through the menu until the place closed. There’s probably some stuff on this menu that you’ve never seen before, and that your server might steer you away from. For instance, apparently white people don’t usually like Japanese yams. We wouldn’t know, because our waitress successfully talked us out of ordering them. Probably a smart move after that “custard” surprise."

",1.0,Mexican,Tortaria,7.6,"New York will never be the taco city. We know that. We can't win 'em all, and considering we have pretty much everything other cuisine on lock down, we probably shouldn't get too upset about it. Also, it gives us a reason to actually look forward to traveling to LA. Tacos aren't the only form of delicious low-brow Mexican cuisine though. One avenue NYC hasn't driven down yet is the torta. Enter Tortaria, a new-ish cafeteria which focuses on the glorious Mexican sandwich it's named after. We're surprised more people aren't talking about this joint, because it's a diaper dandy (sorry, I've been watching way too much of the NCAA tournament).
We went in not expecting much, but left pleasantly surprised by what's going on at this place. Quick, specialty fast foods are something lower Manhattan now thrives on, and Tortaria deserves to be mentioned alongside their fellow low-cost, high-reward brethren like Luke's (lobster rolls), Bobwhite (fried chicken), Caracas (arepas) and Mile End (sandwiches). Tortaria has some issues, which we'll get into, but the food certainly isn't one of them. The menu is large, yet focused. There's a Mexican sandwich and a taquito for every palate. And that guacamole, oh hell yeah. It's ridiculous. Each and every batch is made fresh to order and is crazy good.
Before arranging to meet your new online love interest here, you need to be prepared for what goes on. This ain't the spot for sexy time margaritas. There are lots of drinks on the menu, including fresh fruit cocktails and a laundry list of tequila choices, but they take an insanely long time to actually get and the bartender is probably also the dishwasher. Go to Mayahuel for date night. Tortaria is more like an NYU dining hall - overflowing with college kids and serving quick eats on the cheap. In BusBoy talk, which I now find myself using way too often these days, ""Tortaria is a thunderdome of Mexican sandos, with mad kids posted up lookin' to snack tough and chill out. You feel me?""

And for that matter, did we need a new Spanish restaurant opening on the absurdly over-crowded Lower East Side? Definitely not. Actually, let’s say from now on that the LES is officially full. Sold out. There’s no more room for anything, and that includes but is not limited to: bars, lounges, pizza joints, places that sell Vietnamese sandwiches, restaurants operated by any company called “The (Something) Group,” music venues, Miami-style condos, and Rag & Bone stores. Take that stuff to another place that could really use the economic development, like the West 30s, or North Korea.
As you might be able to tell, we haven’t exactly been lamenting the absence of good Spanish food in this city lately, nor have we been dying to hang out anywhere near the Lower East Side vortex. But a friend was in town, and for one reason or another we ended up this ’hood in search of something new and good to eat. Luckily, we’d heard some nice things about Cata, a new tapas restaurant on Bowery that for some reason also specializes in gin and tonics. I guess you’ve got to specialize in something.
After now having more than one meal at Cata, we are here to tell you that this is place is actually really good. Say what you will about the fact that the traditional tapas restaurant is starting to feel tired (I said that), but the food on this menu is very solid and reasonably priced. We also like the room a lot. It’s well appointed and large enough that getting a table here isn’t a huge pain in the ass, but it’s also not so big that it feels impersonal. The communal tables and long section of counter seating also make for an informal vibe, which is then magnified by the super chill wait staff. It’s a nice change of pace from the all the small, cramped restaurants around here that are full of waiters who think they’re the James Franco of food service. Don’t worry, dude. You’re gonna break out any moment.
Despite all of the angry things we started off saying in this review, we’re actually really glad that Cata decided to open its doors in this over-crowded part of town. We may not need another Spanish restaurant, but we can always use more restaurants that do what they do well and make people feel like their money has been well spent. We will definitely be back, if only to reacquaint ourselves with the gin and tonic. Pretty sure the ones I had at Cata were the first since my second senior year of college. And I’m also pretty sure the ones I drank back then didn’t have small batch gin and/or ice in them."

",2.0,Japanese,Bozu,6.0,"For all of the things that Williamsburg does have when it comes to restaurants, one thing it doesn't seem to have is excellent sushi. We've been trying for a while now to find a place worth visiting twice, but for some reason that's been elusive. Maybe there just aren't enough big money spenders in this part of the city to for a really high quality sushi establishment to survive. The good stuff tends to be expensive, and therefore the best sushi tends to live in places where platinum and corporate cards live too. Like Midtown.
Unfortunately, we don't want to eat in Midtown, and we find ourselves in Williamsburg from time to time. And there's only so much fried chicken and Brooklyn Lager that a guy can consume in one neighborhood*. So our search for great sushi in Williamsburg continues, and it most recently lead us to Bozu.
Here's the kicker, Bozu isn't even really a sushi restaurant. It's ""Japanese Tapas,"" because of course it is. I think what that means is that they have all kinds of inventive small plates on the strange tiny plastic menu they hand you, a few of which we tried and cared for very little. What that also means is that you won't find straightforward sushi here either. What you will find are sushi ""bombs,"" which are basically rice and fish and other stuff pressed together into a neat dome shaped thing. The bombs we liked.
Overall, Bozu is a weird little restaurant that has very obviously been around since before Williamsburg's restaurant scene blew up. You know, back when SEA Thai was the only other game in town, and you had to have funky lounge beats and club lighting in the dining room to stay up with the game. Needless to say, we don't love the vibe at Bozu, and we didn't love the service either. The staff is entirely Japanese, and while they are all very nice, the kitchen seems disorganized and slow. The food in general didn't impress us much, aside from a few of the bombs which were actually pretty good. Check the Food Rundown for more details, but let's just say Bozu is not the Williamsburg sushi we're looking for. Maybe nowhere is.
*Redacted: There is no such limit to said consumption."

",2.0,American,The Saint Austere,6.4,"This is a very difficult review to write. Not because The Saint Austere has bad food or because we had a bad experience or because one of our cell phones was stolen by a homeless person outside the restaurant, as happened to one patron (shout outs to both the restaurant staff for quickly calling the cops and the cops for quickly arriving on the scene). It’s hard to write simply because we feel so utterly ambivalent about this place. There's just nothing new or interesting going on here. As a matter of fact, you’ve seen all of the dishes at The Saint Austere at other restaurants in the city. Scratch that, at every restaurant in the city. It almost seems like the chef went on an eating tour and collected menus before he made his own. Octopus? Yep. Meatballs? Sure. Pork Belly? Check. Bone Marrow? Of course. Beet salad? The menu wouldn’t be complete without one! And here are your fish, steak, and chicken entrees. Or maybe we could interest you in a meat and cheese plate? The only thing missing is a f*cking kale salad.
As for everything else, the decor here is as generically predictable as the menu: exposed brick walls and tin ceilings with wooden communal tables. The good news is that there is a great wine list with very reasonable prices, and the staff is really friendly. If we lived in the neighborhood, we’d probably stop in, sit at the huge bar, and order the polenta and some vino once in a while. As a matter of fact, that seems to be what goes on here - lots of people from down the street hanging out and eating serviceable food. We're all for places like that. But just know that this is definitely not a restaurant worth making a special trip for."

",4.0,Sushi,Sushi Yasuda,8.4,"There are three simple rules for having a mind-blowing eating experience at Sushi Yasuda: 1. Sit at the sushi counter. 2. Order the omakase. 3. Sit back and enjoy. If you want to complicate things and add a fourth rule, we’d recommend closing your eyes while you chew. You’ll look like an idiot, but you don’t want anything distracting you from this fish. Yasuda is known for having some of the best sushi in the city, so we came in expecting a lot, and it still blew us away. The rice is excellent - slightly warm with just the right amount of vinegar. And we think it goes without saying that the fish was perfect, but we’ll say it anyway - the fish was perfect.
When you sit down, you’ll be handed two things: a short menu that features a few kitchen dishes and drinks, and a sheet featuring the day’s sushi choices. The sheet will likely have fish on there that you’ve never heard of before, unless you majored in marine biology. No worries. Just say “I’ll have the omakase,” and the chef will serve you about 20 pieces of the best fish they have that day. Depending on what you get served, it will cost somewhere between $100-130 per person before drinks. And it’s worth every penny. If you’re not that adventurous or are saving up for a special occasion (although you should really save up for this special occasion), you can also order a la carte. But be warned that although the a la carte menu doesn’t look that pricey, the pieces of sushi are pretty small, and it will take quite a few to fill you up. After our 24-piece omakase meal, some of us could have kept going for another 10 pieces or so. My credit card company wishes I had. Now I just have to figure out who to call about this interest rate. I’m not even sure Discover has a phone number anymore.
While the fish was fantastic, the overall experience wasn’t perfect. The service was very rushed. We were seated at 9:30, and we were finished, paid, and standing outside by 10:35. That’s a quick window in which to eat 20+ pieces of sushi, and especially quick if you consider what that means you’re spending per hour. The chef served the pieces two at a time, which pressured us into eating the first one quickly so we could get to the second before the fish warmed up and the rice cooled down. Even worse, one of the sushi chefs had customers who finished before we did. He took off his chef’s coat, stripped down to his undershirt, and starting cleaning his station. While we were still eating! Nothing encourages an appetite like watching a skinny-fat Japanese guy’s gut jiggle while he scrubs something. On the other hand, the restaurant was filled some extremely good-looking people, so we’ll call that a push. We were pretty sure that the girl sitting next to us was on one of those ABC Family shows that people in their twenties watch. Can someone invent a Shazam for celebrity faces? It just goes to show that if the fish is good enough, people will gladly eat dinner two blocks east of Grand Central. Well, at least marginally famous people with TV sitcom salaries will."

",3.0,Pizza,Paulie Gee’s,9.0,"You know you live in an amazing city when both Paulie Gee’s and Roberta’s exist in it. Most major metropolitan areas would be lucky to have one incredible, inventive pizza restaurant like this, let alone two. And that’s not to mention the countless other legendary, more traditional pizza places we have in New York. At some point, you just start to realize that you probably won’t ever be able to live anywhere else in the country and be truly happy. Good luck moving away and eventually coming to terms with the fact that a place called Tony Brooklyn’s New York Pizza in the mall near your house is your best option for a pie. That’s right. The mall. Better pick up some Zoloft on the way there.So, right about now, you are either reading this review somewhere in New York and agreeing with everything I said in that first paragraph, or you’re sitting in front of your computer in Philadelphia, getting ready to write us some angry email about how you guys have great pizza, too. But before you hit send, let me assure you that you don’t. Sure, you might have some spot in your ’hood that does a decent Neapolitan pie, and you might even be able to find a respectable slice from time to time. But you do not have a Paulie Gee’s. You don’t have a place that combines creativity with quality like this. And you don’t have a place that makes you feel this good when you eat there. I’m not sure I’ve ever been this satisfied while stuffing pie after incredible pie down my throat, drinking a hoppy craft beer from Brooklyn. Every single thing we’ve ever eaten at Paulie Gee’s has been better than the next, from the pizza with sopressata and spicy honey on it, to the one with gorgonzola and dried cherries. And to top it all off, they make vegan pizzas that are actually really, really good.
So while you’re sitting there thinking about whether or not Papa John’s will put some jalapeños on your cheeseburger pizza tonight, those of us here in New York will be making the tough decision of whether we hit Paulie Gee’s or Roberta’s for dinner. Maybe we’ll just go to Paulie’s and eat the Roberta’s tribute pizza they have on the menu.
God damn we’re spoiled."

",1.0,Mexican,La Superior,7.4,"La Superior is a very cool little Mexican taqueria. This restaurant has always reminded us of a Williamsburg version of Café Habana, but with slightly-less- awesome food. The place is always packed, the staff are more interested in each other than they are in you, and it’s cash only, but I suppose that’s all part of La Superior’s charm. At the very least, it’s always a good situation where you can fill your belly with tacos and booze and not empty your wallet in the process. On our last visit, we sat down with a group of eight, ate and drank damn near everything on the menu, and got out for $23 a head, thanks in large part to their $10 margaritas that come in a pint glass."

",3.0,Filipino,Jeepney,7.9,"You might have heard by now that we're awfully fond of the Filipino crew known as The Maharlikans. We jumped on their bandwagon very early, almost three years ago when they showed up on the scene as a brunch only pop-up in the East Village. They've found lots of success since then, continually evolving and expanding, and adding Filipino cuisine to the wide list of ethnic foods that are well represented in New York City's restaurant scene. And not only has the local food community embraced the Maharlika team, but they even have Padma's stamp of approval...and she's on TV sorta.
Jeepney is Maharlika's second East Village restaurant, and this one is a take on a Filipino gastropub. That means lots of unhealthy, delicious creations made with a laundry list of ingredients that you've probably never heard of before. Here's the good news: If you like the idea of eating various pig parts in some sort of spicy chili sauce, you're going to love this joint. If that's some version of a recurring nightmare you've had over the last few years, this probably isn't going to be your favorite restaurant. And you should maybe talk to someone about that. Jeepney has a fun vibe, with boobs on the wall and a soundtrack that jumps from funky salsa to 80's to old school hip hop and 90's rock. We were impressed when ""Black Hole Sun"" came on the stereo and the entire staff went for it, in unison, like it was 4AM at Sing Sing Karaoke. This is our kind of establishment, that's for sure.
With Maharlika, which remains their better restaurant, and now Jeepney, Filipino food is quickly becoming one of our favorite new discoveries. Some of the food at this new restaurant is familiar gastropub fare, but with a twist that makes it different and unique. We loved the burger, which is made with a mixture of beef and Filipino sausage and served with spicy banana ketchup and aioli. There's also a full fried fish with chili peppers and a tomato-onion salsa is like nothing we've ever had before. And then there are things that are entirely new to us, like bulalo - a beef short rib stew with bone marrow. A couple cons: Jeepney is not cheap. For this kind of food, the prices are a bit steep, something that stings a little more due to the fact that the restaurant is cash only. It's still worth a trip though. If you want to get real crazy, come on Thursdays, which are Kamayan nights, Jeepney's spin on the Filipino traditional pre-colonial communal feast. No plates. No silverware. You eat with your hands. Sounds like a great first date idea to us."

",3.0,Latin,Xixa,8.1,"The folks from Traif have a new Mexican(ish) restaurant, and they've elected to name it Xixa, pronounced ""shiksa."" For those of you ladies out there who aren't of the tribe, that's basically what a Jewish guy's mother might call you once the two of you started dating - at least when she's talking to her friends. Add that up with the name of their first place (""traif"" is a word for non-Kosher things like pork and shellfish), and we're officially impressed with both the food these guys cook and their acumen for coming up with restaurant names that might piss off the nearby Hasidic community. If there's a Hebrew word for ""unholy bread monster,"" it's definitely going to end up being the name of a bakery someday.
We've said for a while that we think Traif is an excellent and under-appreciated restaurant, and now that we've been to Xixa, we're even more convinced that this team is putting out some of the best food in Brooklyn. Xixa is a small restaurant with a big, Mexican influenced menu, and it's full of interesting and delicious things that are worth a trip to South Williamsburg for. There are about thirty different small plates on the menu here at any given time, and in our experience, ten to twelve of those things will absolutely blow your mind. The rest are inspired-but-decent at worst, and absolutely none of it is going to bum you out. As long as you've got someone to guide you through the menu (Immaculate Infatuation at your service), you should have a pretty exceptional meal at this place.
Really, the only thing that's standing in front of us and an even higher rating of Xixa is a fairly serious conceptual flaw. You see, everyone that you encounter at the restaurant will explain to you that this menu is meant for sharing. They'll tell you to order a bunch of stuff and split it amongst the group. And then they'll start bringing you plates that are completely the opposite of ideal for sharing. Interested in those steak tacos? I hope all four of you aren't, because it only comes with three tortillas. Those duck lettuce wraps sound good, don't they? Well, they are. But they only come with a few pieces of lettuce, and there's hardly enough of the delicious fixins on the plate to finish off more than one wrap. You can read more about it in the Food Rundown, but essentially, this place can be frustrating for anyone not dining in a group with odd numbers. Maybe we should start a new category called Perfect For: ""Dinner With A Third Wheel,"" and put Xixa at the top of the list.
There are a few other things we could gripe about too (inconsistent service, cramped dining room), but ultimately Xixa is a restaurant you absolutely need to visit in the very near future. The food that's coming out of this kitchen is really, really good. And if you haven't been to Traif yet, you need to put that on your Hit List too. Cheeky names aside, these people know what they're doing."

",3.0,American,Maysville,8.0,"Add another good restaurant to the list of reasons that this part of Flatiron along Broadway might finally be turning the corner. Ever since the Ace Hotel opened a few years ago, we’ve been waiting for this area to become something more than a place for weirdos to sell cheap luggage on the street. And it just might finally be happening. Between the new businesses and the New York startup community deciding to settle around here, this neighborhood seems to be benefiting from some fresh investment. That’s exciting news for everyone - except the guys looking to sell you a suitcase/maybe stab you.
This one block of West 26th Street is a particularly good example of our food-focused optimism for Flatiron, as it’s home to not only Hill Country and our new favorite Korean spot Hanjan, but also Maysville, a restaurant from the folks behind Char No. 4 in Brooklyn. Much like Char No. 4, this new spot is all about brown liquor, and they serve an excellent menu of things that have been “smoked and charred” to go along with a massive selection of bourbon and whiskey. But this is definitely not a BBQ restaurant. This is an American restaurant with Southern influences. You’ll find far more smoked fish here than you will slow-cooked meat, and there are also lots of vegetable and seafood-focused dishes that are both interesting and delicious. We made two trips for dinner to Maysville, and on both visits were totally impressed with the quality and creativity of the food. Not that we had low expectations - but we think we’re just a little bored with restaurants that are somehow paying homage to the American South. Fortunately, Maysville is anything but boring.
There are, however, two small grievances that we feel need to be mentioned along with our very high rating of this place. First of all, at both of our dinners, our server seemed a little bit lost. Ok, not lost - clueless. To the point that when we asked about one of the bourbon drinks on the menu, she speculated that it might be rum. Yikes. Also, Maysville is a really loud restaurant. The main bar/dining area is big and sparse, and lots of people hang out here for drinks after work. The end result is a room that amplifies the conversations of many buzzed people into one load bourbon-fueled roar. It’s hard to hear yourself think, let alone hold a discussion. If you’re looking to have a proper meal, we recommend making a reservation for a table in the smaller, more intimate dining room in the back. You’ll be much happier. We also recommend doing a little research before you come, so that you don’t have to depend on the expertise of the staff to guide you through the menu. At least not until they’ve had a few more months on the job."

unmarked subterranean restaurant is a unique and amazing place. It's a dining
experience that stands out, makes you feel special, and leaves you
wanting more. And when we're investing a good chunk of money in a meal, that's exactly
how we want to feel.
This isn't your typical Japanese style omakase situation
of being sped through 20 different pieces of fish on rice. Kyo Ya is a kaiseki
style Japanese meal, which according to our research (Wikipedia), is a ""type
of art form that balances the taste, texture, appearance, and colors of food.""
Think Blue Hill, but for Japanese food.
You won't find typical sushi here. Aside from their signature pressed sushi,
the raw part of the menu is all sashimi and not just any sashimi - this is
fish of the highest quality that's been labored over, dressed up, and served
in one of many beautiful handmade vessels. The menu is mainly cooked dishes of all different styles, textures, and flavors - many of which you've never tasted or heard of before.
Speaking of service, that's one of the best parts about Kyo Ya. When dining
here, you're immediately made to feel a part of the Kyo Ya family. The staff
are warm, friendly, and attentive. The menu can be confusing, but they make it
a point to offer up an education, which we greatly appreciate. You can get the
full experience with one of their $95, $120 or $150 tasting menus (all of
which must be arranged at least a day prior), but sitting at the bar, ordering
a la carte, and watching Chef Sono do his thing is how we usually do it.
There's a permanent menu of Kyo Ya fan favorites, and also a seasonal menu
that's always changing. No two trips to Kyo Ya will ever be the same, and
that's exactly why we like it so much."

The last time I was lucky enough to score this kind of view for a chew was senior prom at Windows On The World, may it rest in peace. Becky Chase, what up girl? Remember that night? Me neither. So when we heard about a modern Korean restaurant on the 39th floor of an office building bordering on K-Town, what do we do? Get over there.
We rolled into Gaonnuri knowing nothing other than that it was up high and served Korean food. Unlike your typically divey K-Town establishments, this restaurant is about as sparkling and immaculate as it gets. It's a massive space with multiple rooms and floor to ceiling windows overlooking the bright Manhattan lights. Eats with a view, indeed.
Gaonnuri is a bit like a restaurant from WALL•E, with waiters carrying around iPads and wearing ear pieces. The menu at Gaonurri is nuts - it's nearly seven pages long, covering all the Korean bases, plus a $105, seven course tasting menu for those who ball hard. The dishes from those many pages are hit or miss. Some, like the steak tartare, are awesome. But others, like a dry bossam and an underwhelming bibimbap are let downs. The pace and overall service also tends to be a bit weird, and interactions with with wait staff can be awkward. Must be the iPads.
Although it's right around the corner from Madison Square Garden, you won't find us hanging at Gaonurri before a Knicks game or a One Direction concert. At the end of the day, this is only a restaurant we'd return to for the right occasion. Like prom."

None of us here at The Infatuation are currently in a position to drop a minimum of $450 a head for dinner before booze, tax, and tip. And the CEO of Goldman Sachs won’t return our phone calls, so it looks like our plan to have him buy us dinner there and discuss ""investing in the website"" is on hold. I guess we read all those Jim Cramer books for nothing. Luckily, Neta is run by two chefs who learned their stuff from Masa himself, so now you can get a Masa-lite experience with a slightly more manageable check at the end. It will only cost you an arm instead of an arm and both legs. Sorry, I’ll stop making jokes that my Dad would like.
While Neta is certainly less expensive than Masa, it unfortunately isn’t your best option if you want to spend good money and get fantastic sushi. We've had much better meals at 15 East and Sushi of Gari, and were hoping this place was gonna bring it harder for the cash it cost us. For example, on my recent visit, my party sprang for the larger omakase – $135 per person, also known as “a sh*tload of money” – and we weren't exactly $135 worth of impressed. From what we could tell, it wasn't much different than the cheaper ($95) option. Our waitress told us that the more expensive omakase featured “three more savory courses and additional pieces of sushi.” We were expecting a larger variety of sushi. Instead, we got the same sushi they serve everyone, but got two pieces of each roll instead of one. Maybe we should have asked for clarification, but that wasn’t what we were hoping for when we handed over a suitcase full of bills. Ultimately, Neta would be a much better experience if you go and pick a few pieces of fish and the small plates that they do best. There are some incredible things to eat here, but there are also some duds on the menu. It's also probably a much better experience if you have endless money to spend. Then again, so is everything."

As we're all well aware, barbecue isn't a game we play on home ice here in New York (hockey reference?). It's not native to this land, and try as we may, there are only a few smoked meats in this town that can hang with the good stuff south of the Mason Dixon line. Mighty Quinn's is one of them.
Mighty Quinn's got their start at Smorgasburg. A former drummer from Houston was smoking meat in Pennsylvania and driving it in to Brooklyn every weekend. Soon people started lining up for it. What started as a personal obsession for the pit master suddenly became the obsession of pretty much everyone in Brooklyn. Mighty Quinn's would sell out of food every weekend, and quickly became the most popular vendor at Smorgasburg. Now, having fine tuned their craft as a pop-up, they have unleashed their Texas meets Carolina ""Texalina"" BBQ on the East Village. Get excited. Because Mighty Quinn's first brick-and-mortar home is the real deal.
The reason you should be so excited is that the food at Mighty Quinn's is most definitely not the ""good by New York standards"" kind of BBQ that you'll find in so many other places. This is legitimately bad ass BBQ that you could just as easily be eating under blue skies in cowboy boots and a pair of Wranglers. Mighty Quinn's meats are so juicy and tender they sweat beautiful little fat droplets, and it's so smoky and flavorful that no sauce is necessary. The sides are great, and the good selection of craft beer and simple design and layout of the restaurant make this place highly conducive to stress free, unrestrained BBQ smashing. Mighty Quinn's may have only opened a few weeks ago, but it's already clicking on all cylinders. There's even a garage door ready to be lifted once the weather turns."

As we all know, any respectable home for the scruffy hipster artist types better have a good place for them to congregate, eat breakfast, drink coffee, and talk about how broke they are. Egg certainly wasn't the first Williamsburg restaurant where this kind of morning gathering could happen - but it's always been the most important. This place has always been a staple for the neighborhood, and they take a very serious, farm-to-Chuck Taylor approach to their food. So serious that they even have their own farm outside of the city.
Even though we don't live in Williamsburg, Egg has been in heavy rotation for what seems like decades at this point (probably since 2009). We love this place. There's no bullsh*t here, just a stark white space with friendly service and reasonably priced, high quality food. The only downside? Don't even bother trying to compete with the crowds on the weekends. It's an absolute zoo. Monday through Friday is when you want to hit Egg, especially if you've got business in the 'Burg.

",3.0,Mexican,El Toro Blanco,4.7,"It's time to pull the plug on the expensive taco thing. Too many people are trying to pull off elevated restaurant tacos, and at this point, if we're paying six dollars per fish taco, that f*cker better be filled with great white shark meat. It's one thing if you're doing Mexican and really pushing the envelope -like at Empellon Cocina. But fancy tacos just don't get the job done anymore.
We were really looking forward to El Toro Blanco, mostly since we like Chef Josh Capon's cooking. Lure Fishbar is consistently solid, and we're big fans of Burger And Barrel. Unfortunately though, we won't be singing this new restaurant's praises. El Toro Blanco only further fuels the ""NYC doesn't know how to do Mexican"" fire.
We will say that Capon and his guys have done a good job making El Toro Blanco a nice space with a great vibe that makes us want to drink tequila. We certainly did some of that that. As for the eating, there are a few highlights on the menu, like the guacamole and some of the brunch items - specifically the Enchiladas con Huevos. But the tacos, which are the focal point of the menu and arrive displayed on platters like bottle service at a club - are a big fail. Most of the three bite, $4-6 wonders we tried didn't even warrant a second bite. The service is suspect too. We've dined here a number of times now and had one waiter who wouldn't have payed attention to us had we been sitting in our underwear, and another who sported serious attitude for no good reason. Some of our entrees also showed up at the table cold. The whole experience just gave us the feeling that El Toro just doesn't have their sh*t together. And honestly, when the best thing on our dinner table winds up being the side of corn, that's a problem. As is a $12, three sip El Toro Margarita that tastes like it's made with bottled Cuervo Margarita Mix.
Ultimately El Toro Blanco is a trendy spot that's Perfect For some Action At The Bar and a is slightly less of a party than what you'll find a few avenues over in the Meat Packing District. The food just isn't all that good. But judging by the consistent crowds, that won't matter much in the grand scheme of things. We may be over the expensive taco trend, but clearly there's a market for it. Especially in this part of town."

What we can tell you is that we'd love this place too if we lived down the street. But when it comes to traveling this far for dinner, there are probably other restaurants in the area that we'd rather be. So why the local love affair? I think there are a few things that make Locanda Vini e Olii so popular around these parts. First of all, the food is good. It's genuinely Northern Italian, and if you're impressed by authenticity, this menu will push your buttons. Second, the restaurant itself is ridiculously charming. They basically converted an old pharmacy and made it look like Il Buco in Brooklyn. It's prime Date Night material based on aesthetic alone, and honestly, if you can't close the deal after bringing someone to a cozy, rustic restaurant like this, then you're probably going to be alone forever. Third, there's an excellent wine list that's very reasonably priced. And finally, the staff is really, really nice. So add that all up, and it's no mystery why the people of Clinton Hill, Ft. Greene, and Brooklyn in general are so fond of this restaurant.
Ultimately for us, even though there was a lot we liked about Locanda Vini e Olii, we just didn't love it enough to slap a crazy high rating on it and send people from all parts of the city rushing to dinner here. We are spoiled in New York in the fact that there is a restaurant like this in almost every neighborhood around town. Consider yourself lucky if this one is yours."

",3.0,Italian,Trattoria L'incontro,8.1,"Trattoria L'incontro was not likely to be a restaurant we would ever actually go to, let alone one that we would review. At least that's what we thought two years ago, when we were here to shoot some video content with one of our artists. It's not that Trattoria L'incontro seemed like a bad restaurant at the time. It just seemed like a really corny restaurant. And it was in Queens.
Fast forward to present day, and here we are ready to tell you that Trattoria L'icontro is not only awesome, but worthy of a trip to Astoria with a group of your friends. If you currently live in Astoria, probably none of this is news to you, and you're probably just annoyed that we are writing about your neighborhood like it's a Mexican border town. ""Can you believe we actually went there!?"" Sorry about that. We're learning.
So what changed? For starters, we pulled our heads out of our asses. All it takes is about five minutes of research online to figure out that people go absolutely apesh*t for this place. We also finally started getting into some new parts of town to eat food, and Astoria is one place we know we need to visit more. So we put a dinner with some friends at Trattoria L'incontro on the books, and what do you know...we loved it.
What's funny is that all of the things we initially took to be a sign of suckage, were actually quite charming. The restaurant is basically what you'd imagine Little Italy in Long Island to be. Everything is over the top and overstated. The walls are sponge painted. The hosts and servers wear earpieces like some kind of guido secret service, or the staff from an Old Navy in Naples. There are more ""specials"" than there are things on the actual menu. The chef's name is Rocco Sacramone, and he looks and acts like a guy that Ray Liotta would play in a movie. But none of that turned out to be bothersome because it's all honest. No gimmicks, just really good Italian food and really nice people. So listen when we tell you to jettison any preconceived notion and take some friends out to dinner here. Trattoria L'incontro is the perfect place for one of those ""once a year"" kind of meals where you eat way too much and come home with a purple mouth. Especially during the holidays."

",3.0,American,Jacob's Pickles,7.0,"Jacob's Pickles has been or our list for a minute now, after hearing from many sources that it's one of the few/only Upper West Side restaurants with great food and a downtown vibe. We are always trying to get out in the UWS more often, and yet we always seem to end up at random restaurants that either suck or have a number in their name, which means it will suck. I'm sorry but I don't have to eat at a restaurant called Figaro 81 to know its not gonna be good. So when people start telling us about a place in the neighborhood that's focused on pickles and biscuits, and looks like a huge rustic cocktail lounge, we're listening.
After a few visits we have come to the conclusion that Jacob's Pickles is indeed one of the better and cooler restaurants on the Upper West Side. People pile into this place, and we can understand why. But if it were downtown, you'd hear considerably less about it. The food here is a creative menu of comfort cooking, built mostly with things like fried chicken, gravy, fried pickles, and the aforementioned homemade biscuits that are the size and density of a commercial cinder block. It's basically the kind of food that gave Paula Deen the pancreas flu, but served in a New York City setting. The problem though is that much of it is a snooze. There are a few key items on the menu that'll make you happy and also very fat, but the rest of it is forgettable. Things like mac 'n cheese that should be easy and satisfying end up tasting bland and uninspired for some reason. As for the pickles, those are great, but when they fry them, the arrive at your table in a heavy, soft batter not unlike what you'd find on a corn dog. We prefer ours a little more crispy.
At the end of the day, Jacobs Pickles is great if you need a spot for drinks or an Upper West Side dinner meetup with someone you know will embrace the heavy bar food. There are some good beers available, and they also have a pretty solid brunch, assuming you're planning on taking a nap after it. But it's not a restaurant with traveling for.
Fried Pickles
As we mentioned above, we weren't crazy about these. They're very doughy, to the point that the batter almost tastes like a doughnut. We'd prefer them to be salty and crispy over sweet and pillowy. Order them if you're craving something fried, but temper expectations.Matzo Ball Soup
This soup was actually our favorite thing at Jacob's Pickles...by far. It's a huge bowl of delicious homey goodness with thin noodles and big hunks of chicken.Honey Chicken & Pickles
These ""Southern Biscuit Sandwiches"" are the best section of the menu, but you better be hungry. They're HUGE. This one is a massive biscuit with fried chicken tenders, honey, and a pile of shredded pickles on top, and then another biscuit on top. It's delicious, but good luck picking it up. You're gonna need a fork/shovel.Mushroom Gravy Smothered Biscuit
Another good ""sandwich"" that's really just a huge pile of food that happens to include bread on the top and the bottom. The gravy is tasty, but you can feel it hardening your arteries as you eat.Wild Catfish Tacos
These fish tacos are probably your best option if you're trying to take in less than four thousand calories in one meal. Unfortunately, they're not very good."

",3.0,Middle Eastern,Almayass,7.9,"I’m not exactly sure that New York City was in desperate need of an Armenian/Lebanese restaurant, but this stateside opening of Almayass, a Beirut-based establishment with locations across the Middle East, is very exciting for at least three or four of us here.
At first glance, Almayass looks a lot like what you might expect a new Middle Eastern restaurant in Flatiron to look like. It’s a nicely appointed room with white tablecloths and a vaguely Mediterranean looking tree hanging over a few of the tables. Small speakers in each corner play a strange mix of loungey hotel beats and what I believe to either be the Arabic version of Michael Buble, or music from the movie Aladdin. The staff is worldly, and while they don’t all seem to hail from this specific region, everyone looks the part. Very few have two discernible eyebrows. Ultimately, if you’ve ever walked into an upscale Greek restaurant, you’ve seen this movie before.
What makes Almayass exciting though, is its unique brand of cuisine. Almayass not only focuses on traditional Lebanese food, but also Armenian food, because the two cultures are so tightly knit. There has been a large Armenian population in Lebanon for centuries, and the best things that both of these peoples eat are on display at this restaurant. For someone like me with ties to both cultures, this place is heaven. The problem though, is that I’m not sure that Almayass will be heaven for you if this food doesn’t connect you with some version of home. It’s a fairly formal and expensive restaurant, which means it’s not the place to take a big group of friends who are just looking for some hummus and a falafel. Almayass is more of a [perfect_for slug =“dinner-with-the-parents”]Dinner With The Parents[/perfect_for] version of Tanoreen or Balade. And if your parents are Lebanese or Armenian, jack this rating up a full point. You’d be hard pressed to find a better restaurant for a family meal and some nostalgia on the table. Just don’t tell grandma what you paid for some of the same stuff she cooks in her sleep."

",1.0,Japanese,Tabata Noodle,7.0,"There isn’t much we love more than a warm bowl of ramen. We all know the East Village is where it’s at, but Midtown has slowly become another part of town where us noodle junkies can get a proper fix. There’s Totto on the west side, Hide-Chan to the East and Crave Fishbar, while not a traditional ramen house, serving up an incredible bowl of handmade noodles with chili glazed hake. Plus, Ippudo is coming in the not so distant future. Thankfully, us Midtown lunchers are no longer stuck with average bowls from Sapporo and Menchanko-Tei to quench that craving.
Tabata is another option to get on the Midtown ramen radar, especially if you either work in Times Square or commute to Jersey via Port Authority every day (sorry about that). It’s nothing fancy, a small ramen house that sits on the corner of a bus exhaust pipe and hell. 40th and 9th is a block you should never actually be walking on unless of course you’re headed directly to Tabata. It's nothing fancy, just a straight up soup shop without any bells and whistles. They clearly spent no extra money to spruce the place up, however, they did splurge on some sweet cartoon caricature shirts. We kind of wanted to buy one.
While the restaurants we mentioned above are head and shoulders above Tabata, this is still very solid soup. They’re known for their signature Tabata Ramen, a coconut flavored noodle soup. They also do a mean spicy sesame flavored Tan Tan Men soup. We have a feeling we’ll be hitting this hard all winter."

If Sandy were to permanently conquer lower Manhattan, what would we have missed the most? A bagel with belly lox, cream cheese, tomato and capers from Russ & Daughters, the LES institution of smoked fish and Jewish ""appetizers"" that's been around since 1914. You know a place is the real deal when it's equally beloved by the old guard of Jewish immigrants as it is by their children and their children's children. And it ain't just us Jews. Everyone loves a good bagel and lox. It's a New York tradition.
We usually don't review bagel joints. Sure, we've got plenty of love for H&H; (RIP), Murray's and Ess-a-bagel, but you won't find them on The Infatuation. Russ & Daughters isn't your typical bagel place. This is a smoked fish museum of deliciousness that people come from near and far to experience. The guys behind the counter, most of whom have been there for decades, are professional sandwich makers. There's an art form to it, so don't rush them. The way they hand cut the Nova, smear the homemade cream cheese, angle the tomato, thinly slice the onion, and finish it off with a couple capers takes dedication and focus. You can taste the love in every bite. Take a number, find a small crevice of available real estate, and wait your turn. Try and avoid accidental tuchus contact with an old Yenta and keep your eyes peeled for A-list celebrity sightings. You never know who you might run into."

",3.0,Spanish,La Vara,8.5,"Assuming you still read other websites and magazines for restaurant reviews (magazines?), you've probably heard about La Vara, this new Spanish restaurant in Cobble Hill. The other guys have written about it ad nauseum because of its well-known husband and wife chef/owners who also operate Txikito and El Quinto Pino in Chelsea. Those two places are extremely well respected, and though we're not quite as in love with them as everyone else seems to be, we can understand why people are talking about La Vara opening in Brooklyn.
I think ultimately we are just bored to death with Spanish restaurants. We have so many of them in this city, and they're all essentially the same. The menus hardly vary from one to the other, and they all attract the same clientele. Sorry if I don't sound excited about the prospect of another night eating croquetas next to a table full of drunk girls trying to relive a semester abroad from 1997. We've also been burned in this scenario before. This time last year, the very same people hyping La Vara were freaking out over Tertulia, a new Spanish restaurant from another well liked chef. That one turned out to be a big let down.
Luckily, La Vara bucked the trend and has us excited about Spanish food again. Instead of rehashing what we've already seen so many times, chefs Alex Raij and Eder Montero decided to do something different by exploring the influences that the Jews and Moors had on Spanish food over the centuries. I can't tell you exactly what that influence was, because I remember absolutely nothing that I learned in school. What I can tell you is that the end result is not some crazy departure from the small plates that you're familiar with, but the dishes are just more interesting and include some elements that you might not expect to see on a Spanish menu. It's also a quaint little restaurant on one of the nicest blocks in Brooklyn, making it both Perfect For Date Night and an amazing Neighborhood Hang if you live in the area. Just make sure you brush up on your Spanish pronunciations before you go. The servers here do not f*ck around when it comes to rolling an ""r"" or saying ""gracias"" like ""grathias."" Let's just say we did a lot of pointing at the menu."

You’ll probably hear some combination of Golden Unicorn, Jing Fong, Dim Sum Go Go, and maybe even East Manor in Flushing, assuming you’ve got some real showoffs in your midst. Nom Wah Tea Parlor will surely come up, too, as it should.
For the novice dim sum consumer (“that means dumplings, right?“), it can be really difficult to discern where to find the best Chinese meal of tiny portions in this town. We’re certainly not experts, and after doing tons of research and surveying Twitter, we essentially ended up just flipping a coin. Luckily, the coin landed on Nom Wah Tea Parlor last weekend, and we had a very successful meal. But there are definitely a few key parameters by which you should make your dim sum dining decisions. Let us explain why Nom Wah worked for us.
First of all, we were high on Nom Wah because we didn’t feel like having to fight an angry lady with a pushcart to get some food. Dim sum traditionalists will tell you that this is all part of the experience, but as far as we’re concerned, we’ll take the food without the conflict. Everything at Nom Wah is made to order and delivered directly to your table (plus, the service is friendly). Second, the simple fact that this place has been operating since 1920 tells us that they’re doing something right. The restaurant feels like a relic from a different era, and the food seems to have changed little as the decades have passed.
Check the Food Rundown for details, but Nom Wah is very simply an excellent place to eat some good dim sum and have a little fun. Is it the best in the city? We’ll leave that to the experts to decide. Hint: None of your friends are experts."

We have to say though, that while we enjoyed our time with John Brown, we didn't quite go crazy over the BBQ the way others have.
You know us. We're always down to tackle a full spread of assorted smoked meats, but nothing we ate here had us thinking best BBQ in NYC. Part of that may be because they were out of their best and most celebrated meat, the brisket burnt ends. We were there early too, at like 7pm, so we can only imagine that being out of the ends is a regular occurrence. We loved the lamb sausage and pulled pork, but the brisket definitely wasn't incredible, and the ribs and sides were kind of a bummer. We did, however, really like the overall vibe of this place. The Smokehouse recently re-located from a small Astoria space to a larger hub in Long Island City, complete with a big boy beer garden, a live music stage, picnic tables, and copious amounts of hangout space. It's gonna be a prime candidate for the Summer Guide 2K13. Unfortunately, they haven't updated their Google Maps location to LIC, yet and we were moments away from taking an incorrect train to the wrong spot. A word to the wise - make sure you know where you're going, and don't trust the map on your phone. If it's Apple Maps, you're probably f*cked either way.
At the end of the day, if you and your crew appreciate trays full of BBQ and massive bootfuls of beer, John Brown should be on the radar. Just temper expectations, and pray for burnt ends."

",2.0,BBQ,Ducks Eatery,4.6,"We ended up at Ducks Eatery a while back after reading all kinds of business on the internet about how amazing their chicken wings are. After a few visits, we are ready to report back that a) the chicken wings aren't that good, and b) we have absolutely no idea what is going on at this place.
This ""restaurant"" (it's really more of a bar with a small menu) is so random that here's how our first visit went down. We popped into Ducks on a Wednesday night for some wings, and ended up eating home made beef jerky, St. Louis Ribs, some trail mix (?), a bite or two of brisket, a giant bowl of mystery noodle soup, and exactly zero wings. Why? Because we had to throw in the towel before the wings arrived. By that point there was a vicious sectarian battle between rival spices raging inside our stomachs, and we were too confused by what we had just eaten to carry on.
A second visit dedicated to wing consumption was also unsuccessful. The hickory smoked jerk chicken has way too much rub on it, and the wings are huge like they came off of a condor. No thanks. For some reason, everything in this place is so over spiced, over smoked, and overthought that none of it works. The beef jerky has squid ink on it. Why?
If it's wings you're after, do yourself a favor and hit Pok Pok or Pork Slope. If you're looking for some BBQ, get out to Fette Sau. We don't really know what to tell you to come to Ducks Eatery for...except maybe to have a drink and some trail mix. Or you could just go camping.
Chicken Wings
As we mentioned before, these wings are too big, too hard to eat, and way too heavy on the jerk seasoning. A little restraint would go a long way. So would a smaller chicken.Beef Jerky
Another menu item that's really more of a bar snack, this beef jerky has been cured in squid ink, which does...something. Maybe it makes it darker. It certainly doesn't make it taste much different than the rest of the beef jerky that we've eaten over the years.Yakamein
This vaguely Asian noodle soup is apparently popular in New Orleans, and our waitress insisted that we order it. It looked a lot like ramen, but had more of a lime/lemongrass flavor to the broth. It was probably the best thing we ate at Ducks, but we wouldn't order it again.St. Louis Ribs
These were big, dry ribs that tasted like they spent too much time in the smoker. Go eat ribs somewhere else.Brisket
This is definitely our highlight from the menu at Ducks. Probably because it was well cooked and properly seasoned. It seems to be a limited menu item, so if you're there, ask about it."

",3.0,Seafood,Aquagrill,7.9,"Aquagrill falls into a certain category for us - one that only includes three or four other establishments. We're going to call it ""SoHo Restaurants That Don't Give a Fck"" for the purpose of this review. Others in the category? Blue Ribbon Brasserie and Raoul's. And what exactly do we mean when we say they ""don't give a fck?"" Certainly not that the service is bad. Aquagrill and the others all take very good care of their guests. What we mean is that these places have been around for decades, and as countless restaurants and restaurant trends come and go, they remain standing - unaware and uninterested in the fact that every single new spot in the East Village either has a pork bun on the menu or some guy that looks like Charles Dickens with a swizzle stick making $14 cocktails. These are restaurants that have white table cloths and still give you a bread basket. And they're still packed every night even though bread baskets are NOT cool.
What's funny about the timing of this long overdue review of Aquagrill is that what they do best - raw oysters - are the hot new restaurant thing of the moment. Everyone either has oysters on the menu or has ""oyster bar"" in the name of the place, like some sort of insurance in case the rest of the food on the menu sucks (see, The Dutch).
Aquagrill has been putting up dozens on the half shell since 1996, and there are very few places that do it as well as they do. On any given day you'll find fifteen varieties, and they're all fresh, cold, and perfectly shucked. That alone is a good reason to come here - if we were rating Aquagrill on raw bar alone it would be a 9.5.
Unfortunately, the rating comes down a bit when you get into the rest of the food here. As you might expect, the menu is almost entirely made up of various seafood offerings, and it ranges from pretty decent to very good. It all depends what you order. We've found that some of the fish entrees can be a bit boring, and that they often rely on things like truffle oil and sesame ""crustings"" to elevate a dish. After a few bites, you get a little tired. That said, this is the perfect restaurant for a group of vegequarians to get their fish on, and it's also a nice environment for Dinner With The Parents or a downtown business dinner. Just make sure you order a sh*tload of oysters...and don't expect the bartender to make you a sazerac. He'll probably just give you a whisky."

Preconceived notion fail on our part, apparently. Each of the three times we've been here, it's been nothing but crickets in this place. Weird, considering that Monkey Bar was Vanity Fair kingpin and seasoned restaurateur to the stars Graydon Carter's big purchase a couple of years ago. I guess there ain't much money left in magazines these days, huh?
We're actually surprised more people don't flock to Monkey Bar. It's a fine restaurant, especially for Midtown which is filled with overpriced letdowns kept afloat by tourists and suits who don't know any better than to plunge their money directly into the dumpster. If you book lunches for your boss, get this on the radar. They may drop some serious corporate chang here, but at least they'll eat well and get the royal treatment. On each of our visits, we were brought out extra dishes from the kitchen for no apparent reason. We're into that. We're also into the classy, but not-soooo-stuffy atmosphere at Monkey Bar. The retro-chic room comes complete with a massive mural dedicated to the good ol' days and plenty of big ass comfy red booths to get your cush on. That's all well and good, but the real reason we keep coming back is the bread. Wow. It may be the best meal starter yeast in the business.

Monkey Bar Chopped Salad
Each time we've come, the chopped salad has changed. Our favorite was this one
- greens, tomatoes, chickpeas and pickled onions.Shrimp Cocktail
A pretty standard shrimp cocktail. Our one complaint was that the shrimp were a little soggier than they were crispy. We like it best the opposite way.Steak Tartare
It looked amazing, but the result was less than stellar. The huge chunks of beef were just too big and the potent meat flavor was overwhelming. Pass.Maine Lobster Club
We love lobster sandwiches. They are one of our favorite things. This one was a big time bummer. There was way too much bread and not enough lobster. This sad lobster club was a waste of money and should be removed from the menu. Or, they should serve it with at least double the amount of lobster and remove a layer of unnecessary toasted bread.Monkey Bar Burger
It's a $22 burger, but it's worth every penny. The blend of chuck, short rib and dry aged steak give it a real meaty flavor. The burger is juicy beyond belief and comes topped with sweet and sour peppers, garlic aioli and pepper jack cheese. It's one big, delicious mess and one of our favorite real deal burgers in midtown. Plus, the fries are incredible as well. So yeah, you should probably order this.Potato Gnocchi with Field Mushrooms
Gnocchi? Not really. More like mashed potato dumplings. All good though, we still enjoyed it. There were probably two sticks of butter in it. Good luck with those two extra hours in the gym the following morning.Pappardelle with Lamb Ragu and Spicy Relish
A rich, satisfying plate of pasta. We thoroughly enjoyed the thin pasta ribbons drenched in sauce are can confidently suggest ordering this.Rohan Duck
Our waiter suggested the duck and the kitchen delivered the goods. We really enjoyed it. Two thick, blood red slices of breast are sauced in a delicious reduction and paired with a roasted corn salad and grilled peach.Peanut Butter Ice Cream Sandwich
Save a bit of room for dessert, because you're ordering it at Monkey Bar. We ordered the chocolate mousse and our waiter decided it was necessary we try the ice cream sandwich too. Good move, sir.

The whole neighborhood is full of “cute” restaurants, nearly all of which are Perfect For increasing your odds of gettin’ some action (or finding your soul mate or whatever). But there are different destinations for different situations, and Aria serves a certain purpose. This is the wine bar you want if you want things to get handsy.
What we mean by that is that this place has “let’s meet for drinks and then drink too much and then make out on the street” written all over it. Aria is a picture perfect, cozy little room, ideal for a first date experience. You can sit and have a few glasses of wine while you get to know each other, and assuming things are going well enough to turn drinks into dinner, the Italian small plates here are very, very good. But what makes Aria particularly Perfect For Drunk Hook Ups is the fact that they also have a full bar and are constantly bumping some sort of Euro party music playlist. The next thing you know, you’ve followed four glasses of Barolo with three shots of tequila, and you’re not so much sitting in your stool as you are half-standing and trying to rub your crotch on Prince Charming’s leg.

",4.0,French,Daniel,9.1,"It's an interesting thing, finally eating at Daniel after having been to so
many other Daniel Boulud restaurants first. Clearly this is a world-class
dining establishment, as evidenced by a bunch of Michelin stars and Barack
Obama visits. But we've had enough bad experiences at his other restaurants in
town (DBGB and Boulud
Sud) to wonder if
the Boulud way is one that two idiots like us can truly appreciate. We know
good food when we eat it, but classic French dining is not what this site was
built on.
Knowing that, it shouldn't surprise you when I say that while I was very
excited to finally be going Daniel for dinner, a part of me was a bit
skeptical. Restaurants like this either live up to your expectations or they
don't. There's no in-between. I was sure this would be a good meal - but would
it be exciting? Only time would tell. Time and lots of money.It turns out that our meal at Daniel was absolutely incredible. It lived up to
all expectations and even exceeded some. To start, the service was perfect.
Never once did we get the French guy stink eye - only friendly and attentive
stewardship from people who know what you want better than you do. The food is classic, with little deviation from standard French practice, but it's also
inventive and insanely satisfying. We ate a lot, and not one thing let us
down. What surprised us though, was how lively the restaurant was on a
Saturday evening. Considering that this place is situated in the
epicenter of old money New York City, we expected to see nothing but cranky
old ladies wearing fur and treating the bus boys like personal property.
Instead, we found lots of young couples and people from out of town who were crossing this place off their bucket list. It's a nice environment, especially
if you eat in the salon area that's a bit more informal and upbeat.
Ultimately, Daniel is one of the best dining experiences we've ever had, and
we're glad to be saying that. And while this definitely doesn't change the way
we feel about the other places of his that we're less fond of, it does add a
little bit of context, and help us understand why people are still giving this
guy money. If someone hit me up right after this meal to invest in a ""downtown gastropub modeled after CBGB's"" I probably would have done it. 
Good thing I've got all my money tied up in this little gold mine of a website instead. Who wants to buy some banner ads?
The menu at Daniel changes regularly, but take a look at the photos in the Food Rundown to get a sense of what's on offer."

",3.0,American,Dudley's,7.1,"Not long ago, this tiny restaurant on Orchard and Broome was adorably named Little Giant, conceivably because the food was big, while the restaurant was incredibly small. Unfortunately, the food wasn't quite big enough to keep the place afloat for more than a few years, and a new restaurant now occupies the space.
Dudley's is the new establishment that's now opened up in this still tiny dining room, and it's brought to you by the folks that run Australian bar and restaurant hot spots Kingswood and Ruby's. It's got the distinct feeling of a place that's gonna be a hot person hang out, regardless of whether or not the food is good. We hung here on a recent summer evening and had a really good time eating, drinking, and scoping the clientele...almost like we were in a nice part of the West Village as opposed to one of the worst parts of the Lower East Side. The food didn't blow our minds, but we came away glad that this insane neighborhood has something a bit more...neighborhoody again.
The menu at Dudley's is large and varied, from light bites and vegetable starters to sandwiches and hearty entrees. We recommend leaning heavy on the first half of the menu, and also having lots of drinks. There are a few very delicious things to eat, but there are also some let downs on the menu that you should know to avoid. Either way, this place is far more about the hang than it is a memorable meal. Go in with the right expectations and you'll be glad it's there."

",3.0,Pizza,Otto,5.5,"There was a time, back around 2003, when we thought that Otto was pretty exciting. I had just moved to the city, read the book Heat, and was all about eating Mario Batali food wherever I could. Remember that this was before a sentence like ""new restaurant from a Food Network celebrity"" meant sh*tty food at the hands of the Neelys. Otto was pretty good, pretty unique, and worth a trip every now and again when we felt like eating pizza that we didn't have to point at through a glass sneeze guard.
Fast forward to 2012, and we can't stand being anywhere near this place. Not necessarily because the food is bad (it's not great), but because it's an overpriced tourist trap that seems to exist only to make Eataly look civilized and affordable. On our last visit we had two glasses of wine and a plate of olives and it cost us nearly sixty bucks. No thanks. There are plenty of other places in this city to get an awesome pizza and a few glasses of wine without having to do so crammed next to a guy who tried to pay for his meal with a fistful Euros from a Gucci fanny pack."

",3.0,Pasta,Lavagna,7.9,"The East Village has its share of Italian restaurants for you to choose from, and good ones at that. We've spent plenty of time at Lil' Frankies, Max, and all the rest, but Lavagna was the one that we'd been neglecting for some reason over the last several years. Maybe it's because Lavagna (Italian for ""lasagna"", we assume) has a bit of an older clientele than the others. Our friends never really talk about this place like they do Frank or Supper, and we only do things that all of our cool friends are doing. I tried a cigarette yesterday.
Even though it might not be the coolest of the East Village Italian restaurants, Lavagna is right up there with the best. The place has been in business since 1999, and it's still busy every night. Chalk it up to an excellent and consistent menu of pastas and entrees that keep the regulars coming back, exceptional daily specials, and a really good wine list. It's everything that you want a cozy Italian restaurant to be, and it's not even all that expensive. The service can be a bit...abrupt at times, but for some reason we kind of like that here. They are so busy making good food for people that they have no time for your bullsh*t indecisiveness. So don't take it personally when your server is less than amused with your witty banter at the table. And whatever you do, definitely don't try dropping that lasagna joke. You'll get thrown out on the street."

",2.0,Bar Food,The Brooklyneer,7.4,"Has it really gotten to the point where Manhattan needs a bar that celebrates the culture of Brooklyn? Apparently it has. We were skeptical of The Brooklyneer in concept alone - it’s got a big mural of the Brooklyn Bridge on the wall, and a bunch of food on the menu that’s named for the neighborhoods there. It’s almost so ridiculous that for a while we were convinced it was all just an elaborate joke from the people at The Onion - “Manhattan Bar Serves Food From Brooklyn, Idiot Foodies Actually Eat There.”
After getting over the initial ridiculousness of it all, we’ve actually warmed up quite a bit to this idea of Brooklyn on Houston Street. The Brooklyneer is most definitely a bar with food, not a restaurant with a bar. But in terms of bar food in New York City, this is some of the best around. It turns out that Mile End hot dogs and artisan pickles are hard not to like, and they make a few sandwiches here that are straight up amazing. The place has also proven to be useful hangout, despite the fact that it can be a crowded mess some nights. They’ve got all of our favorite beers on tap (Captain Lawrence, Kelso, Sixpoint, Coney Island) and a drink we think about all day Agua Escondida, which almost makes it worth battling all the nine to fivers hanging out here after work.
Oh, and for all you crazy intense soccer fans out there, The Brooklyneer is the place to watch. They take their fútbol very seriously, so you and all your MLS fan friends can come watch “matches” here. Just kidding. We all know there’s no such thing as MLS fans."

",3.0,Italian,Rosemary’s,7.1,"Rosemary’s is essentially Meatpacking, but for the West Village. As for the food? It’s OK. This is more a place you come to hang with friends and have some wine than anything else. 
The wine list is well-priced, and serving sizes are small, which is fine because most of the clientele here have a 7am SoulCycle class to go to in the morning. We’d recommend going heavy on the pastas and sampling an entree or two. 
The more impressive element of this place is that they run a tight ship. The intimidating line to check in (they don’t take reservations) and raucous bar area makes this place look like an absolute zoo, but things are kept in order. You’ll most likely be sitting at a table before your allotted wait time is up. And if not, the bar area is vast and populated. Go make some new friends."

",1.0,Bar Food,The Penrose,7.5,"Prediction: By the year 2022, once all this horrible Second Avenue subway construction is done, the Upper East Side will officially be cool. As more and more people are forced uptown due to the preposterous downtown rental market, the UES is suddenly sprouting some reasonable consumption junctions. No longer are neighborhood residents stuck with places like Dorrian’s and Brother Jimmy’s, because high-quality bar/restaurants have slowly started popping up. First Jones Wood Foundry, then ABV Wine Bar, and now, the biggest and most earth-shattering of the bunch, The Penrose. Tell the construction workers there’s no need to blow the horn on 2nd between 82nd & 83rd. The above ground explosion has already happened.
When the book is written on the future transformation of the Upper East Side, there will be a whole chapter about how The Penrose revolutionized the social experience up north, paving the way for other not-terrible places to follow in their footsteps. Despite only being a week old, The Penrose has already replaced J.G. Melon as the most popular watering hole/face stuffing establishment on 2nd Ave. It’s the latest all-purpose hangout from the folks behind downtown hot spots Wilfie & Nell and The Wren. Judging by the immediate raucous crowds, their reputation of hosting a good time has preceded them.
As you can see, we are impressed with The Penrose. They’ve succeeded in seamlessly making the UES as cool as it can possibly get, and there’s no shortage of action. This massive restaurant is room after room and bar after bar filled with seas of people. The space just seems to go on forever. The beer selection is well thought out and priced nicely, but the food is what’s endeared The Penrose to us. The menu is concise, cheap, simple, and exactly what we want to eat at a bar with a volume level of this magnitude. The spicy beef sandwich is delicious, the burger solid, and their fried pickles are some of the best we’ve ever had.
Someone on Twitter asked us not to blow this place up before the neighborhood could enjoy it. The Penrose didn’t need any of our help - it’s already bananas."

",1.0,Fast Food,Sticky's Finger Joint,7.8,"""Get fingered.""
That's the slogan at this fast food joint in the Village, and it's perfect. Why? Because you're gonna get it.
""It"" in this case is not an actual below the belt handshake, but a wide array of genius chicken finger flavor creations, ranging from Buffalo to General Tso's to Cordon Bleu to an insane salted caramel thing that looks like this. Sticky's is basically stoner food at it's best and most ridiculous, and it's no accident that it's a few blocks from NYU and open until 4am on the weekends. Talk about a fail proof business model. Sticky's also proudly claims to use only the highest quality chicken and ingredients, which is nice to think about as you cram a deep fried piece of poultry that's been filled with mozzarella into your mouth. Thank god that thing lived cage-free.
We've got to admit that even though we aren't Sticky's target audience, we kind of love this place. We sampled pretty much every variety of finger this place has to offer, and they were all excellent. I guess you don't have to be blazed to enjoy a chicken strip that's been made to taste like sushi, or one that's covered in tortillas, guacamole, and something called ""cray"" sauce. Just know that you probably aren't gonna feel good about yourself after the fact. I suppose that makes the slogan even more appropriate."

",3.0,French,Marché du Sud,7.3,"The market-meets-restaurant concept is not a new one in New York City, and Marché du Sud isn't all that new either. A few years ago, this place opened up in the East Sixties aiming to be a ""French version of Citarella,"" presumably without all the awful people shopping in it. The market portion of the restaurant sells a wide array of imported products that people from France and people that wish they were from France get nostalgic over, and there is also a bakery, a butcher, a wine bar, and a partially enclosed garden on site. Not to mention the restaurant itself, which specializes in Tarte Flambée - basically a French pizza for those of us that need our food explained in children's terms.
Even despite the fact that Marché du Sud sounds a little bit on paper like France Pavillion in Epcot Center, the food here is pretty damn good. We happen to really like those pizza things, and the restaurant also serves very well executed French classics that are simple and delicious. The bakery is a great spot for a croissant and some coffee, and there's even an unexpectedly excellent burger on the lunch and dinner menu. It's all a little bit strange, especially when you take into account that they play the absolute worst music you could ever imagine at remarkably high volume, but Marché du Sud is an underappreciated restaurant in this area. It's not something that you need to make a special trip for (save that for Epcot), but neighborhood-types take note. This place will surprise you."

",2.0,Seafood,Lobster Joint,7.4,"Somehow, someway, despite existing for well over a year, Lobster Joint in Greenpoint eluded us. We're idiots. This joint f*cking rules.
Until now, none of NYC's interpretations of the dressed down seafood shack actually led us to believe that we were anywhere near a beach. But even though it isn't exactly located close to marine life (unless you count the East River), Lobster Joint accomplishes this. They may not have a pool or any sand, but we're rocking our bathing suits and flip flops here anyway. The restaurant has a laid back approach that you don't often find in NYC. We love the the order-at-the-counter-and-we'll-bring-out-your-food system which works great with the spacious, open air dining room. There's also a nicely sized, well maintained Outdoor/Patio Situation littered with picnic tables and umbrellas. If you're a seafood freak like we are, prepare to be in heaven. If it comes from the sea, they put it on a bun. And you'd be hard pressed to find any joint better suited for summertime Day Drinking than this one. We could hang here all day sucking down beers, fried clam strips, and lobster rolls.
Speaking of lobster rolls. We may be throwing down a high rating on the Lobster Joint based on the overall experience, but when it comes down to straight up roll vs. roll, we still think Luke's is the best. The Joint has them beat everywhere else.
Fried Clam Strips
These strips couldn't have been fried any better, and the sheer amount of them was breathtaking. Eight bucks well spent.New England Clam Chowder
The chowder here is really good. It's thick and creamy with an ideal clam-to-potato ratio. Definitely order this, but try not to fill up on it. There's too much other goodness to be had.New England Lobster Roll
It's true that we'd rather eat Luke's claw meat lobster roll over this one if we had to choose. But The Joint's roll is no slouch. The lobster salad is light on the mayo, with lots of substance.Connecticut Lobster Roll
We're usually not fabs of the lobster roll served warm, but LJ's CT roll is where it's at. If we're ordering one item and one item only, it would be this. We loved the simplicity of the toasted bun, warm lobster, and drawn butter.Lobster Club Roll
Lobster salad with bacon and avocado? Sign us up. Trust us, it's as good as it looks.Crab Roll
The crab roll was the one sandwich we had that we wouldn't order again. The lump crab didn't taste like much. Skip it.Clam Roll
This one, however, is awesome. It's exactly the same as the appetizer clam strips, but on a bun this time.Crispy Oyster Roll
You can't find a fried oyster roll as simple and delicious as this around NYC. Get it.Lobster Dinner
We don't crave a full on lobster experience much when we're in NYC. We need to be out by the beach or somewhere that doesn't smell like hot garbage to get into that mode. If we were to ever need our fix though, this is absolutely where we'd come. $36 gets you a steamed 1 3/4 pound lobster with red potatoes, corn on the cob, coleslaw, and pickles. You don't have to cook it, and you don't have to clean it up. You just have to eat it."

",1.0,Latin,Coppelia,7.0,"We were pretty fired up about Coppelia when it opened. A latin-themed diner from the good people behind Infatuation favorites Yerba Buena and Toloache? Sign us up. Sadly, we weren't overly impressed the first time we went. Neither were we on the second, third, fourth or fifth. We keep coming back though, despite not being blown away by the food. Here's why.
Coppelia is CHEAP. We're not talking affordable by NYC standards, we're talking cheap in Des Moines, Iowa. The majority of the menu clocks in under $10 which makes it possible to eat like a king and get a beer for under $20.
Being that it is so cheap, it's hard to hate on the food all that much. You could be doing a lot worse. Coppelia's pedigree almost works against them because we hold Yerba Buena in such high regard. However, we need to keep in mind that this is just a diner. And if this was a random diner we stumbled into knowing nothing about, we'd have found a diamond in the rough.
Another reason we're cool with Coppelia is because it's open 24 hours. This may be the city that never sleeps, but when it's 4am and you need to eat, there really aren't that many solid options. This is one of them. Additionally, Coppelia is centrally located between the West Village, Chelsea and Meatpacking making it convenient anytime you're on the West side. More importantly, the best part about Coppelia is that it's right next door to one of our favorite establishments in NYC - The Donut Pub. Skip dessert and go for a black & white cookie.

",3.0,American,Clyde Frazier's Wine and Dine,7.0,"Just to be clear, if there's a basketball court inside a NYC restaurant, that restaurant is not getting below a 7.0 from us. Especially one that doubles as a shrine to the legendary Walt Clyde Frazier. Please keep that in mind as you read this review.
Our love for the Knicks is well documented, so you shouldn't be surprised that we'd geek out over a restaurant like this. Throw in the fact that Clyde and his friends - we've spotted Earl The Pearl, Tiki Barber, and Justin Tuck on different occasions - are all hanging out here, and it's easy for sports fans to get lost in a world of star struck excitement. But this isn't a Dave & Busters. This is an attempt at a legitimate restaurant, and we need break it down as such.
In truth, without a basketball court and Clyde's involvement, we wouldn't be talking about the Wine and Dine. The restaurant is massive - it takes up an entire city block. We were there for a Rangers playoff game and it was barely a quarter full, which makes us wonder how they stay in business. The layout is clunky too, and while we like the idea of life sized Clydes on the walls and his tie collection lining the ceiling, it all comes off feeling a little sterile and strange. Exhibits A & B: the custom Clyde-ism cocktails that come in ridiculous spring break style martini glasses, and the bottomless beer mugs that come floating in an ice bucket. Weird.
On the bright side, in terms of restaurants reserved exclusively for Sports on TV, which is exactly what Wine and Dine is, the food is pretty damn good. We love the sweet and spicy wings, and most everything else trumps whatever you'd find at the local sports bar near your apartment. Sure, it's everything's a tad expensive, but we'll happily trade a couple of bucks for some quality Clyde time.
As a full body of work - basketball court, crazy martini glasses and all -Wine and Dine is pretty impressive. You just don't see things like this in NYC very often. If you're a hoops fan, it's a must visit. 10th Ave is a hell of a lot closer than than the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, MA. And if you have no idea who Clyde Frazier is, please ignore everything you just read."

",2.0,Italian,Eataly: La Birreria,7.7,"We don't typically write about the many NYC beer gardens, due to the much higher presence of dudes and brewskis than actual quality food typically found in them. But this beer garden on the roof of Eataly might be the exception to that rule. In fact, you'll be hard pressed to find one with a larger variety of good things to eat, and the crowd is much more pleasant up here than in the tourist packed insanity that exists underneath it.
In fairness, La Birreria is more like a rooftop restaurant than it is a true ""biergarten."" It's a far more organized operation than the typical mess of community seating and standing around found at its authentic German counterparts, but as a result, the place also loses some of that beer swilling, get-drunk-with-a-stranger charm. Reservations for La Birreria are a must, though you can also stroll in unannounced and put your name on a list. Should you choose that route, expect to be quoted a 45 minute wait and invited to ""take in what Eataly has to offer."" For us that usually means pre-gaming with a bottle of wine and some meats and cheeses in the La Piazza section, but maybe not everyone wants to drink before they start drinking. I guess you could shop?
Once you make it upstairs, you'll enjoy a surprisingly calm environment with a varied menu of Italian food options, including the prerequisite beer garden sausage offerings. Oh and there's also beer. We're big fans of Birreria's cask conditioned house brewed ales, and there's also an extensive list of other draught and bottled options, along with some wines. That all might sound a little too fancy and put together for the average beer garden goer, but at the end of the day, that might be why we like it. We'll take good food and a laid back atmosphere over polka bands any day."

Neither of us are 22-year-old models, nor are we the people trying to have sex with them. On the other hand, it's supposed to be a restaurant, not just another Chinatown cocktail den like Apotheke, the other joint these people own. Sounds like fair game to us.
Pulqueria is basically a carbon copy of La Esquina Brasserie in Soho. It's a subterranean space that looks like some kind of Mexican dungeon, and there's a lot of drunk people in it. But the food at Pulqueria isn't nearly as good, and it's in Chinatown. I imagine it's perfect if you love to eat chips and spend a lot of money on cocktails with cilantro in them, but for us, this is just an exercise in misery. The music is loud, the service sucks, and this place might as well be selling guacamole like night club bottle service. Everything is really overpriced, and even if you spend the money, you still get treated bad. At one point on our first visit, we asked the waitress to split our check into thirds on three credit cards, and she brought over a calculator and told us to do it ourselves. Really. That happened. I guess it's not cool to split the bill. But we've got a tip of our own for Pulqueria about not being cool. You know what doesn't go with the word ""hot spot""? The word Groupon.

Tartine is a quaint little French café that's so female friendly they might as well have a puppy named Gosling out in front that fetches gossip magazines. This is what little girls in the Midwest picture in their mind when they dream about moving to the big city to do fabulous things and eat brunch. It's a shame that they'll all just end up spending most nights at Catch. But dare to dream anyway, right?
People who know and love Tartine tend to fall into three categories: girls, people who live nearby, and people who go to BYOB restaurants. So yeah, girls. The place has all of about fifteen seats, and has been in the neighborhood for two decades, sitting quietly on one of the best corners in the West Village. Brunch is their most popular meal - to the point that people line up down the street waiting for a table on most fair weather weekends - but dinner is perpetually crowded too. We've always found the food at Tartine to be consistently solid, and even though it's never quite awe-inspiring, the aesthetic appeal and the value make this a good place to know if you're in the neighborhood, or just looking to eat well without mortgaging your future. Yes, it's Perfect For the ladies, but Tartine is also Perfect For anyone who wants to have a nice dinner with their favorite bottle of Yellowtail from the cellar (the fridge).

Despite a fast and furious expansion plan that could have easily doomed the brand, it seems that each new opening from this group brings a positive new angle to the growing empire. They seem to really understand that the most important factor is the food, which is never compromised and always consistent. The fact of the matter is that the Blue Ribbon name is as reliable as Mariano in the ninth - before the shagging fly balls incident.
Blue Ribbon Sushi Izakaya may be the most ambitious Blue Ribbon yet. The room reeks of hotel restaurant, but they’ve done a good job at minimizing the hoteliness and making the restaurant feel warm and friendly. The low-rise communal tables and big booths make this an ideal destination for dinner with a huge crew of friends, as does the massive (maybe too massive) menu. The good news is that there is definitely something for everyone - vegetarians, sushi lovers, and meat freaks alike. Our advice is to order a lot and make sure to cover all the important stuff - fried chicken, fried rice, skewers, chicken liver mousse and - wait for it - cold vegetables. That’s right. Vegetables.

",3.0,Mexican,Gran Electrica,8.1,"We’ve done plenty of complaining about the lack of good Mexican food in New York, and to be honest, we’re sick of talking about it. Saying there’s no good Mexican in this city is tantamount to saying that Times Square sucks. Not exactly breaking news. But today might be the day that we can finally put an end to our griping. 
Gran Electrica, a restaurant from the folks behind Colonie, might be the first place we can think of that’s serving simple, excellent Mexican food without any gimmicks. There’s no secret basement tequila dungeon, nor is there a VW bus parked inside. There’s no guy with a guacamole cart, and we have yet to see anyone on staff wear a lucha libre mask. This is simply all of the best things about Mexican food served in a lively restaurant with killer drinks. If we knew where to find that upside down exclamation point on this keyboard, we’d be using it a lot right now.
For those of you who know your Mexican food well enough to understand the nuances, here’s how Gran Electrica gets down. The menu is full of street food-type small dishes - tacos, gorditas, quesadillas, etc. - and you will also find some of the real native staples like posole and tlacoyos. Everything is super fresh and relatively light (no smothered enchiladas here), and there’s authenticity present in all of it. We love the fish tacos, the gordita, everything from the mariscos section of the menu, and the plate of pork ribs that’s served with a side of homemade tortillas. As mentioned previously, the drinks are incredible, too, and the restaurant has a big back garden that sits directly under the Brooklyn Bridge. The only downside? Waits can be north of an hour during prime time, and there aren’t a lot of other options in the area. You’re going to have to cram yourself into the bar and have a few (a lot) of drinks while you wait it out. At least take comfort in the fact that you aren’t standing outside single file like they are for Grimaldi’s next door. Those people look way too sober."

How bold. The restaurant is a joint venture from one of the guys that opened Kesté and a Neapolitan pizza maestro from the old world who could probably make sweet love to your girlfriend if he wanted to, even though he's in his seventies. Or at least that's what his Wikipedia page says.
These two experts put their heads together and came up with Don Antonio, a place that offers more pizza varieties than you could ever want on one menu, and does so in what has to be the least appealing place to eat pizza imaginable. It's basically a nondescript Midtown bar with Euro beats constantly bumping at a level just loud enough to drive you crazy. The pies we tried at Don Antonio were all pretty good, but this is definitely not best of New York City territory. It's not even best of Midtown territory. The flash fried Montanara pizza that garners much of the attention here pales in comparison to the one at PizzArte a few blocks away. So do most of the pizzas now that we think about it. And to top it all off, Don Antonio was just shut down for a few days by the health department. Maybe they should have spent a little less time DJing and a little more time cleaning up."

When that happens, you’ll likely pass by Tartinery, a shiny looking new restaurant and wine bar just down the block from those places. We are here to ask that, despite the fact that there’s an indoor tree and some hot French people inside, you keep on walking.
Not too long ago, we found ourselves in exactly that dinnertime situation, and crammed into the overcrowded bar at Tartinery to try and figure out what the exactly goes on in this crazy place. We had a few glasses of wine and decided that the entire concept appears to be to draw in females with exposed brick and French dudes, and then convince them that open faced sandwiches are the new South Beach Diet. I’ve actually never seen a restaurant more determined to market to women. Not only are there about twenty different types of quaint tartine sandwiches on the menu and lord knows how many organic wines, but there’s also a full slate of fresh juice options, and they play Colbie Callait and the Plain White Tees on repeat because someone definitely told them that American girls love those songs. We made the mistake of going back for brunch recently, and I’m actually shocked that this place doesn’t offer a pilates class.
As you might have started to gather, the food at Tartinery isn’t nearly good enough to make you look past the fact that it’s just some dude’s idea of a girl’s ideal restaurant. The space is unappealing, the menu is all over the place, and somehow despite all of that, Tartinery is usually pretty packed -which makes it an even less desirable place to spend your time. If you’re really desperate to stay in Nolita and/or talk to French people, go to Cafe Gitane or Public. Ask nice enough, and those places might even put on your favorite Colbie Callait song, which is hopefully none of them."

",1.0,Bar Food,Earl’s Beer & Cheese,8.0,"Earl’s probably holds the record for smallest restaurant ever reviewed by The Infatuation. It’s literally the size of a college dorm room and actually has a similar vibe. Remember how much fun boozing in the dorms used to be? I miss listening to Feeder and sitting on the floor playing caps. Damn were we good at that game freshman year.
We weren’t surprised to find that Earl’s is right in our wheelhouse. If an establishment serves a grilled cheese with pork belly, kimchi, and fried egg, there’s a pretty good chance that we’re going to like it. And like it, we do. Earl’s menu of pig and cheese heavy snacks pairs perfectly with the small but righteous selection of draft beers that they have on tap. Head up north sometime to check it out."

",2.0,Diner,Jack's Wife Freda,7.2,"Ladies who brunch, pay close attention. We are about to present to you a brand new spot for your Chronic Brunch rotation, and one that's gonna make you look like the coolest person in your group, or pack, or whatever it's called when more than three of you gather.
Jack's Wife Freda is a simple, cute little café in Soho, opened by a couple that met while working at Balthazar. That's really probably all we need to tell you. If ""cute,"" ""Soho,"" and ""Balthazar,"" aren't the three most important Chronic Brunch keywords, we don't know what are. The food here is an interesting collection of culturally specific dishes from different parts of the world, many of which will be familiar to those who know Middle Eastern or Israeli cooking. What that means is that the menu is very unique, but it's somehow not at all intimidating. Things like green shakshuka (baked eggs in a spiced sauce) might sound adventurous and strange to many, but when presented at Jack's Wife Freda, it's very appealing. Maybe that's because the menu is hand drawn, with little doodles all over it. The doodles are meant to soothe you.
Add all of those things up and throw in a few of their mimosas with fresh cantaloupe juice, and you've got a pretty great spot for your next girls' day out. Unfortunately, that's about as far as our recommendation will go. When it comes to dinner, Jack's Wife Freda is a bit less appealing. The room loses some of it's charm when the sun goes down, and much of the dinner menu is a snooze. We'd be a bit more enthusiastic if things were a little cheaper, but there too many options for a better dinner for the same price nearby. Stick to the daylight hours, and you and your girlfriends should walk away happy."

",1.0,Southern,Bobwhite Counter,8.0,"We were fully prepared to congratulate Mr. Bob White on cooking up the best fried chicken in the East Village until we read the bio on the Bobwhite Lunch and Supper Counter's website. Apparently Bob had absolutely nothing to do with the aforementioned fried chicken, nor is he even a person. A ""bobwhite"" is actually a bird, specifically a quail from Virginia, the home state of this restaurant's owner. Interesting. Regardless of who Bob is, the bottom line is that Bobwhite Counter serves up one fine piece of fried chicken that you need to get your mouth on immediately.
Bobwhite's ain't fancy, but The Counter gets the job done right. The only negative is that, while the food is comforting, the eat-in dining experience is not. It's an awkward room without much character or warmth. The service is close to non-existent, which is to be expected considering you order at a counter and then wait at the bar or a high top table for your food to come out. Still, both times we ate here the lone waitress behind the counter seemed frazzled, overwhelmed, and unhappy. Not a good look. We'll forgive her for forgetting our drinks even though we asked twice, because apparently figuring out how to work GrubHub is a daunting challenge. The frustrating thing is that they have a bunch of good beers on tap, which might otherwise make this a solid neighborhood hang. And while we have put Bobwhite into heavy rotation, you won't find us kickin' it here very often. We've got it on Quick Eats & take out only status, which is probably the point of this whole thing anyway."

",3.0,Italian,Caffè Storico,7.1,"We don't go to museums much, and when we do, it's usually because we want to eat something, and not because we want to learn something. Also, dinosaurs are scary. But we recently decided to check out Caffè Storico in the New York Historical Society because we love so many of owner Stephen Starr's restaurants in Philadelphia, and exactly none of his places in New York City (Buddakan, Morimoto). Maybe this one would be different.
Caffè Storico certainly looks like a museum restaurant. This is a good thing, especially when you consider that most Starr establishments lean heavily on colored lighting and strange looking chairs for decoration (think boutique hotel in Cleveland). We were half expecting to walk into an uptown version of Buddakan, with a huge door that takes three people to open and hostesses wearing headsets. Instead, the vibe is classy and sedated, and the restaurant is full of Upper West Side people who wear their grey hair well. It's a pleasant place to be, and it's certainly appropriate for the environment.
As for the food, the menu reminds us a lot of L'Artusi's, but only half as good. There are no real superstar dishes to come back for, and the prices are higher than they should be. Your best bet is to focus on the fresh pastas and the ""Cicchetti"" section of the menu. A combination of the two will serve you well, especially with a strong drink after all that learning and being quiet. Aside from that, this restaurant is little more than a good bet for dinner in the neighborhood or some pre-gaming before you hit the planetarium. Who wants to get drunk and see a laser show?"

",3.0,American,Red Rooster,7.4,"The Southern food at Red Rooster is fine. Some things are even really good. But that’s not why you come to this now-legendary spot in Harlem. 
You come because few restaurants in this city feel as alive as Red Rooster - the atmosphere is incredible. The bar area is mobbed, the DJ is spinning funk and soul tunes (or come on a Sunday, and the jazz band will be jamming), and people generally appear to be having a blast. Whether you’re here for brunch or a late-night dinner, it’s going to feel like the kind of party where you actually know people.
As for what to order - besides plenty of drinks, you need the cornbread on your table. Multiple orders of it if there are more than two of you. The fried chicken is also solid, although not worthy of the crazy hype around it. But really, the best way to do Red Rooster is to come with a group, order a bunch of snacks, and just take this place in. It’s an experience worth the trip."

We were at Walter Foods a few weeks ago and saw more hugs getting handed out here than on the first day of a furry convention. I guess if you live near Walter Foods, you come here a lot. I guess if we lived near Walter Foods, we would too.
It’s not that we were completely blown away by this favorite among favorites of Williamsburg restaurants. We have found ourselves pleasantly satisfied every time we visit, whether it’s for a few drinks or a full on meal. But we’ve never had that one incredible experience - the one we have every time we eat at Vinegar Hill House. And Vinegar Hill House is actually the perfect “you might also like” restaurant for Walter Foods. Both serve a similarly hefty American menu, both have awesome outdoor dining, and both probably fight over the same sh*t at the antique store for the restaurant walls. But if we have to choose between the two, we’re going Vinegar Hill House every single time. I suppose that’s not the point though. Walter Foods is a neighborhood restaurant. Vinegar Hill House is a restaurant without a neighborhood. You organize trips to Vinegar Hill House just to eat there. You come to Walter Foods because you are in its proximity.
If you do find yourself in Walter Food’s proximity, there are a few things you should stop in for. First of all, the cocktails are all very good, and they will be served to you by guy who calls his vest a waistcoat. Second, this place has one of the best French dip sandwiches we’ve had. People talk all about the lobster roll and the fried chicken, but that French dip is where it’s at. Order that and a dozen oysters and you’re gonna be in good shape. You might even get a hug."

But there are a few excellent neighborhood restaurants out there, and assuming this isn't your neighborhood, it's worth a trip from time to time.
The Good Fork definitely isn't the best restaurant we've ever been to, but it might be the best restaurant in Red Hook. It's a cozy little eatery with a old timey vibe and rounded ceilings that makes it feel like you're dining in an old train car. The people here are also very nice - a trend we are noticing with all of our recent trips to Red Hook.
But what makes The Good Fork particularly intriguing is that their chef is Korean, and she adds bit of Korean flair to classic American favorites like steak and eggs with kimchee rice, or a crab cake with daikon radish sprouts. There's a pork chop and a burger on the menu, but there's also some tasty pork and chive dumplings. These flavors may not warrant an [perfect_for slug =""authentic-ethnic-eats""]Authentic Ethnic Eats[/perfect_for] tag, But they definitely do make The Good Fork stand out in a crowd, even though in Red Hook, it's only a crowd of about five."

Unfortunately, there isn't much saucy satisfaction to be had in this city. Most wings around here suck worse than an episode of Top Chef Texas. There are some serviceable options here and there, most of which are of the BBQ or Asian variety, but when it comes to the Buffalo stuff, pickins are slim. The general consensus seems to be that Atomic Wings is the best in town. Atomic Wings? Really? This is what happens when people listen to people on Yelp.
Maybe our problem is that we haven't been willing enough to travel for a delicious wing discovery. We had heard for a while that Bonnie's Grill in Park Slope was home to some of the best Buffalo style wings around. So why not hop on the train for a taste test? Probably because Park Slope and Scarsdale are equidistant (in our head) and The Candlelight Inn is our favorite wing spot on earth. If we're making moves like that, we're going for the good stuff. But we took the trip to Bonnies nonetheless, and sure enough - we weren't blown away. This is a great neighborhood spot with a full menu of divey bar food classics, but we wouldn't risking getting run over by some runaway twins in a double Bugaboo just for an order of wings. However, you can go ahead and raise this rating up by one point if you live in the area and just need a place for a beer, a burger, and a few precious moments away from Elmo. We feel you."

",3.0,Mexican,Café De La Esquina,7.8,"The folks at La Esquina were smart to tone it down when they made the venture across the East River to Williamsburg. An exclusive dungeon dining room guarded by a guy with a clipboard and a ponytail might work just fine in Nolita, but that stuff ain't gonna play in Brooklyn. Instead, management took their successful formula of street tacos + sexy restaurant and applied it to a Williamsburg appropriate venue, the old Wythe diner (most recently home to a restaurant called Relish). The old school diner remains in tact, but a taco stand has been added, and playing the role of sexy downstairs dungeon is a dark, loungey back room. We like it. A lot.
As for residents, mustache enthusiasts and super fans of Williamsburg, reaction to this La Esquina has been mixed. Most of the complaints tend to come in the price department, and to some extent, we understand that. When you've got La Superior down the street slinging gangster tacos at $2.50 a piece, you're gonna catch flak for prices that are almost double that. But we tend to think there's room for more both approaches, and we're glad La Esquina opened it's doors in the 'Burg. They've got an amazing patio for the summer months and are doing a serviceable brunch too, which adds to its Infatuation friendliness. The menu is pretty much the same as what you'll find in Manhattan, plus a few surprises like a burger and some mole meatballs. Service is a little sluggish, but everyone is friendly, so as long as you keep putting back Modelos from the tap and are cool with spending a little cash, you should come away happy.
Quesadilla De Huitlacoche
This tasty, mushroomy quesadilla with corn and Mexican truffle is unique and delicious, and it's a La Esquina specialty. Order it.Cangrejo Tostada
Our favorite of the tostadas on the menu. Cool crab meat is piled high on a half-dollar sized tostada with mango and spicy mayo. It's one big bite of goodness, and it should be on your table.Tinga De Pollo
Chicken might not be the sexiest tostada option on the menu, but across the board, La Esquina's slow-cooked, shredded chicken is a winner.Elotes Callejeros
Don't mess around. Each person at the table needs to have an ear of this grilled corn in hand. You'll be smiling...with sh*t in your teeth.Taquitos
I'm not even sure why they're called taquitos, because as far as we can tell, these are tacos. Someone send over a translator. Until then, we'll tell you that we love the pork (shoulder and pulled) and the fish tacos. On our last visit, the ""fish"" was actually shark. At least that's what our waitress told us. Can you put shark in a taco? Isn't that against some kind of maritime law?Mole Enchiladas
If you're down with some mole, you'll love these enchiladas. Just don't expect to see a big cheesy mess arrive at the table, like you might at a Tex-Mex joint. These are relatively dry, and slightly sweet and smoky - just like a good mole should be.Hamburguesa
We don't need a translator to tell you that means hamburger. There's no mistaking it ones this arrives at your table either. It's a hamburger alright. We liked the pickled jalapeños on top, but that's about all that sets this apart. Skip it."

",4.0,Wine Bar,Corkbuzz Wine Bar,2.5,"You know what, it's our fault. We should have known that we were going to hate this, and skipped the place all together. Warning signs that should have been heeded: 1) Cutesy wine bar name. 2) Confounding mission statement. 3) The fact that there is a mission statement. 4) $35 glasses of wine on the menu. 5) Unsettling wine snob bartender. Those five things don't add up to a happy Infatuation experience, and we should have done the math and headed to Terroir instead. But somehow, we missed all the signs and happily saddled up to the bar at Corkbuzz for a drink and a bite recently. I think you know where this is going.
Here's the thing about Corkbuzz, which is actually a ""wine studio"" that has a wine bar in it. We love wine. We drink more than we probably should, and actually have a really solid handle on what's what, and (more importantly) what we like. But we certainly aren't experts, and have plenty to learn. Really, who doesn't? So it's naturally appealing to hear that a wine bar is interested in educating it's patrons. It's also appealing to hear them tout a menu of delicious food that we can eat while housing glasses of wine and, um, learning. That's exactly why we love Terroir so much. God we love Terroir. The unfortunate thing is that where Terroir succeeds is precisely the place where Corkbuzz fails miserably. You can't claim to be a place that's interested in teaching the average person about wine, but then make it completely inaccessible for anyone not carrying a Russian ""politician"" sized wad of cash. You also can't give me 'tude when I tell you that I don't care for Reislings. Yes dude, I know they aren't all super sweet, and I've had plenty of them. I'm also gonna need more than two options that cost less than $15 a glass. At that rate, I might as well just go all in and get a master sommelier certification. I'm gonna need a loan either way.
The food situation at Corkbuzz is just as hopeless. We started off our meal with some cheese to go along with our preciously valuable sips of learning wine, and for six bucks, got a slice of something from Switzerland so small that we thought about saving it for next time we're setting a mouse trap. The meats weren't much more appealing, and the crudo and house cured salmon dishes we had were also highly overpriced and unimpressive. The only thing that kept us from going to second dinner after this was a decent bowl of pasta. We still weren't happy, but at least we were a little closer to full for $150. I suppose we did learn one thing for all that money - that we're not coming back here for another lesson."

The specialty pizza here at PizzArte is the flash-fried Montanara pie, but it's the full, surprisingly diverse slate of delicious starters, salads, pizza, and pasta that has us impressed with this place. And that's not the only reason that you should be careful not to write PizzArte off as just another pizza joint.  It also happens to be an art gallery. That must have sounded awesome in the business plan. ""You know why MoMa sucks? No pizza."" ""Sold. Where can I send this sack of gold?"" Or at least that how we assume it went down.
Believe it or not, the concept kind of works.

In no other place on earth will you see so many sixty year old men getting helped up the stairs, but still rocking a suede jacket and jet black hair. Yeah, that blonde girl was totally checking you out dude. Actually, she really was checking you out. Gross.
Luckily, it's not only the old rich guy show at Nobu 57. It's also the single greatest place in the city to watch people watch for celebrities. ""Is that Russell Brand?"" No, that's just a tall lady.

",3.0,American,Sons of Essex,6.1,"The success of the Lower East Side mega-club restaurant Beauty & Essex was bound to create some copycat establishments. Lord knows that there are plenty of drunk girls to cater to down there, and they all have one birthday (week!) every year. So it didn't surprise us to learn that a new, clubby restaurant opened in the old Mason Dixon space - although it did kind of surprise us that they didn't keep the mechanical bull.
This restaurant, Sons of Essex, is a damn near facsimile of Beauty & Essex, not necessarily in decor, but certainly in purpose. The idea here is exactly the same: Come looking good and looking to get wasted, and maybe have some food. Just like Beauty & Essex, there’s a fake out entrance before the entrance, this time a deli counter where you can even get a sandwich. And also just like Beauty & Essex, the food is just barely good enough to pass it off as a restaurant.
We will say that Sons of Essex has a more Infatuation Friendly vibe than some of the other popular night clubs with food, and that they cater a pretty sweet playlist of 90s hip hop to blast at your head while you eat. They also managed to get Padma (call me) in an otherwise terrible promotional video for the restaurant. The cocktails are all pretty damn good, especially the unique boozy tea concoctions that we were pounding. But this giant menu of upscale comfort food disappoints more than it impresses. We're not exactly sure why there needs to be a whole page of grilled cheese and mac and cheese daily specials, but there is. Instead, this place needs to cut down on the 75 different things it offers for dinner and instead do a few things really well. On second thought, I suppose it doesn't really matter much.

",3.0,American,The Smith Midtown,7.7,"There’s something happening, and I’m not sure that any of us are ready for it. Slowly but surely, new and successful restaurants are opening in the East 50s. Some people call this area Turtle Bay, and some people call it Midtown East. But almost nobody calls it a great part of town for dinner. So why are restauranteurs investing in a place that most people only visit for work or intramural beer pong tournaments? Because this is officially the final frontier. New York City has become so food obsessed that even Midtown East has cool restaurants. And if this is the final frontier, The Smith Midtown is the Starship Enterprise.
We wrote about the original outpost of The Smith very early on in the history of The Infatuation. We’ve always been impressed with the upscale diner atmosphere, the solid menu, and the success that the restaurant has had with the young-drunk-lady-types. But when we walked into the new Midtown restaurant, we couldn’t believe what we were seeing. This is not just a reincarnation of the cozy original East Village location. This is a giant, glaring beacon of recession-proof dining capitalism - a multi-million dollar room built for people that are just a few years too old for the cool parts of town, but a few years too young to be staying in on Friday night with the kids. And they are absolutely killing it. We soured a bit on the original Smith recently because the food had fallen off, and it had become too overcrowded to warrant any more visits. But this new location is perfect for where it’s been placed. The food is better than what the East Village location is serving right now, even though the menu is exactly the same. The room is constantly bumping (waits are frequently an hour or more), but in a more “adult” manner. What that adds up to is one of the best options for dinner you’ll have at your disposal if you find yourself in this area."

Although it's not much farther than Carroll Gardens, it's an infinitely more difficult commute, especially when the F train isn't running local stops. I'm glad I made it, because now I know what actually goes on here. You know how sometimes you have a preconceived notion of what a certain place looks or feels like before you've actually been there? Well, I always thought Red Hook was a crazy harborside amusement park and market. Beers! Boats! Fish! Art! That's not the case. There's one block with a couple restaurants, a dope bakery and a lobster pound. No rides. No water balloon horse racing. No fish market. There's a Fairway market (which is amazing), and there's Fort Defiance.
We'd heard a lot about Fort Defiance, and had a feeling going in this was a place that we would be very down with. Although they're known for their libations, this restaurant doesn't feel like one of those super-cool, pretentious cocktail dens that we all know too well. It has the promise of the perfect neighborhood spot that, if we lived in this hood, we'd frequent all the time. We thoroughly enjoyed both the food and drinks here, but it's the friendly, warm service that stuck with us the most. It seemed as if everyone working here thoroughly enjoys their job, which means good vibes for your Chronic Brunch. And that brunch is the main reason you should be heading for Fort Defiance.

Half the people eating in this place are still wearing a name tag from a team building event in the second floor ballroom. It almost felt a little unfair for us to come eat here and give it the full Infatuation assessment, what with our insanely high standards and aversion to the East 40's. But then we thought, f*ck that. Day after day, scores of out-of-towners come to New York City to see what it has to offer, yet never end up venturing more than a few blocks from their Midtown hotel. I can't believe anyone actually comes back. Have you ever seen the TGI Friday's on Lex? I think I saw a rat walk in there on two hind legs once. It's high time we put our foot down and helped guide our esteemed visitors to good food - even if they can't get out of Midtown.
Now, Lexington Brass is infinitely better than most of the tourist trap garbage that you'll find in this part of our fine city. There's no question about that. But this place is dangerous because it actually might lead people to believe that this is what the ""cool"" NYC restaurants are like. It's got nice lighting, a big marble bar, and tiled walls, just like all the hot spots do. But then the food comes, and it's all the same stuff they probably served during a PowerPoint presentation upstairs. It might do the job after a long day, but this is certainly not a great New York restaurant. Oh, and you have to make your way to the basement to use the restroom - right next to the hotel health club, as the host will instruct you. I'll be peeing on the street, thank you very much. At least that way my friends won't think I left after twenty minutes of waiting for the elevator.
The good news is that there are a few really good options near Lexington Brass that will give you a taste of what New York City can do with food. The National, right next door, is an excellent option for dinner - especially for the pork chop. Bar Americain is a short cab ride away. Check out the The Lamb's Club if you're feeling classy.

In fact, we were actually quite impressed.
It is no understatement to say that Catch is the most over-the-top, ridiculous dining operation the Meatpacking District has ever seen. There might be more people occupying the three kitchens here than there are occupying Wall Street...and they all have jobs! As for the crowd? Wow. If this isn't the holy grail of People Watching, we don't know what is. Where do you look first? There's just so much good scoping to do - Euros, models, Suits, old guys with young ladies, and huge groups of females enjoying a Girls' Night Out. This is the definition of non-stop action.
With so much going on at Catch, it's easy to get distracted. Just don't forget that you're here to eat. Chef Hung Huynh, who you might remember from Top Chef, has tamed this monster of a restaurant, and has Catch humming like a well oiled machine. The service is fantastic, and the food is pretty great as well, despite the absurdity of it all. The menu starts off with a $100 Oysters & Bubbles option (it would). We skipped that, but tried a big chunk of the other offerings and didn't end up angry the whole time. It turns out that underneath the glitz and the glamour, Catch is a damn fine restaurant.

",3.0,American,Bell Book & Candle,4.5,"There's a reason why the only thing you've heard about Bell Book & Candle is that they grow a bunch of vegetables on their West Village roof. Think about it though, do you really want to eat ""fresh produce"" from the city of Manhattan? This whole farm to table thing has gone too far. We're putting our foot down on Bell Book & Candles's urban ""aeroponic roof-top"" to table. The streets of NYC may glisten with fresh urine, but when it comes to fresh produce, let's let actual farmers take care of that. Those tomatoes need to breathe fresh country air, not the disgusting city schmutz we all ingest on a daily basis. Getting back to my original point, it's the rooftop garden that gets all the attention because whatever grows inside BB&C;'s kitchen is not exciting.
The actual restaurant is really nice. Bell Book & Candle is huge. It's got a spacious, inviting bar to go along with multiple well-appointed dining rooms. Problem is, if this menu looks too good to be true, that's because it is. That's a lot of action. When you have eight different sections on a menu, one would think a server's first task would be to help you navigate. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Our server was shy and timid, offering minimal help or guidance in terms of a menu game plan. We needed someone to take control and lead us to good BB&C; experience, and, instead, we were left to try and do it on our own - which proved to be a complete disaster. After our snacks arrived first, all hell broke loose. Random dishes came firing out of the kitchen in no particular order, one or two at a time. Salads and appetizers arrived after the entrees and there was no cohesion to our meal. It was really bad news, and the most poorly executed dining experience we've been a part of in a long time.
If the food was delicious, we could have at least overlooked the awful execution. However, that wasn't the case. While everything sounded incredible, not much delivered on the promise, even the rooftop salads. There's a chance we'd come back and saddle up to the bar for drinks and oysters, but, honestly, we wouldn't suggest a full meal here. We sampled close to the whole menu and left extremely disappointed."

",3.0,Pizza,Celeste,7.2,"This old school red sauce Southern Italian trattoria has been an UWS neighborhood staple for years. The food is definitely good and very well priced for the area, but the real reason you're coming to Celeste is to spend some quality time with the owner. Welcome to the Carmine show.
You know his type. The mid-40's Italian with smooth moves, slicked back hair, a female-melting accent, and an aura of something in between confidence and arrogance. We were in awe watching this guy operate. Like Peyton Manning going no huddle out of the shotgun, Carmine was directing traffic all night long. He's the front of house, he's running the floor, he's in the kitchen, and he's chastising his South American waiters for not rolling their r's properly. And yet he always seems to be at your table, shomoozing it up and dropping commentary throughout your meal. We can see how some people might find Carmine a little abrasive - but we were highly entertained. And like him or not, you're going to have to deal with the guy. There's no wine list here, there's just Carmine. ""You like-a red or a white?"" Red. ""You like-a medium or full body? You know me, I like 'em full."" Medium. ""You like it-a fruity? Yup. ""You like-a raspberries or a-blackberries?"" We'll go raspberries. ""You like it-a little bit acidic or a lot?"" A little. And just like that, a very reasonably priced Italian red shows up at our table. Well played, sir. We drank three bottles.
You should also know that Carmine only takes cash, so come prepared. Maybe that's a measure to keep costs down, or maybe there's some kind of mob style pizza ponzi scheme at play. Wait, on second thought, I take that back. Sorry Carmine, I just watched the Madoff 60 Minutes special. Please don't be mad at me."

Aside from a two-star New York Times review from 2005 and a whole bunch of chatter on Yelp, you won't find much out there about this Park Slope staple. Such is the case with a lot of neighborhood restaurants that opened in the middle of the last decade, before the foodbloggerazzi existed to break news about plywood going up on the sandwich place down the street. Could it be a new Momofuku Milk bar? Nope it's a nail salon, now go get a real job.
The good news is that lack of recent internet recognition doesn't seen to matter much for Stone Park Cafe. Try visiting for brunch any time after 11:00am, and you will probably have the opportunity to meet every single person that lives in Park Slope. Waits can get ridiculous, but that's because they're serving the best brunch in the 'hood, by far. We've been several times, almost solely for the short rib hash and the hangtown fry - a plate of eggs and bacon with fried oysters. It doesn't get much more Infatuation friendly than that. Dinner is always solid as well, and the fact that Stone Park cafe has been consistently packing them in for the last eight years straight should tell you that the place is nothing if not incredibly consistent. Our only complaints here have been about service, mostly just because they often seem overwhelmed by the crowds during brunch. I suppose that goes with the territory when you're serving the whole neighborhood at once."

",4.0,American,Saxon + Parole,7.5,"A few years ago, Saxon + Parole was a place called Double Crown. And Double Crown was a place you went if you were too old for the club scene but still wanted a night out. It was actually ahead of its time - a restaurant that could serve as the only destination for an evening on the town, rather than just somewhere to have dinner. Back in 2008, even ultra-clubby Meatpacking restaurants like STK were little more than pre-game for a big night of buying new friends at Tenjune. And the food at Double Crown was actually good.
Unfortunately for Double Crown, the party started to wane after a wave of new big-night-out restaurants came along (see Beauty & Essex) and let girls get drunk in the bathroom for free. Their solution? Shut the place down, come up with a new concept, remodel, and reopen. Before you even knew Double Crown was gone, Saxon + Parole was throwing a launch party.
So the question becomes, will the new coat of paint do the job? So far, the answer seems to be yes. On both of our mid-week visits, Saxon + Parole was buzzing with tables full of females, all of which seemed to be having a better time than they should be on a Tuesday night. The new space is extremely well done and far more comfortable than Double Crown was, but still exciting. As for the food - it's good, but nothing we ate is going to blow your mind. It's also expensive. I don't care how big the short rib is or how many spices it's glazed with (five), I don't want to pay $44 for it. The good news for Saxon + Parole is that somebody probably will. And if they don't? There's always time to remodel."

Chances are you spent some time as a kid hanging at a suburban Texas pool snack bar. I certainly ate my fair share of the stuff (chili+cheese+pile of Fritos), either right before or right after I got a nosebleed from the diving board trying to impress all those girls who definitely weren't looking. Yep. Still got it.
Nostalgia points aside, we really just like Mable's for it's sheer simplicity. This is quality BBQ, and the restaurant could fly just as easily in Austin as it does in our burgeoning BBQ town of Williamsburg. The menu is small and familiar - in some ways the antithesis to the nearby hipster mecca Fette Sau - but everything tastes exactly like you hope it's going to. We loved the brisket and the pulled pork sandwich, and the ribs are solid too. The standard BBQ sides all do they job that they need to, but it is an official Infatuation mandate that you order the Frito pie when you are here - partly because it's awesome, and partly because I need to make sure they keep serving it so I can relive my glory days from time to time.

This Fort Greene restaurant has some impressive credentials (it's owned by the duo behind Marlow & Sons and Diner), but the food doesn't impress much at all. What we can't figure out is how a place like this can look so good on paper and yet come up so short in reality. The menu is a daily changing offering of things that are in season and grown locally, and everything reads like it's going to be incredible. We got all excited about enticing pasta dishes, pumpkin salads and hefty steaks. But nothing we had tasted as good as the menu lead us to believe it might be. One of our pastas was just about on par with the one your roommate made last week for her kickball league potluck. We were hoping for something a bit more refined than that.
The good news is that a short walk from here will take you to No. 7, a neighborhood favorite with adventurous food that over-delivers across the board: drinks, food, service...all of it. Maybe Roman's just needs to worry less about changing the menu so much, and more about finding a few things they can consistently do well. In the meantime, you can find us pounding drinks and eating crazy sh*t down the street."

Not just because they have sweet beards and excellent taste in classic rock, but because they were the gateway drug that helped us open our eyes and discover all that Brooklyn had to offer. I distinctly remember my first meal at Frankies 457 in Carroll Gardens back in the day. It was an eye opening experience. That was the moment I realized that there is more to Brooklyn dining than Peter Luger, and that living in some parts of Brooklyn didn't mean moving in with the Hasidim. But thankfully, I don't need to move to Brooklyn. The Franks are moving Brooklyn to me.
Although it's not as cozy as 457, Frankies 570 is a huge pickup for the West Village. We've been a couple of times now, and are happy to report that the food quality hasn't slipped a bit. The prices still reflect Brooklyn, and the menu is still stacked with all your Frankies family favorites. But 570 has got nothing on its predecessors. That's how it seems to go when great restaurants reproduce - the offspring don't retain the charm and authenticity of the original.
While this isn't a must visit, Frankies 570 is a reliable option that will be consistently packed with carb seeking humanity who might just appreciate the fact that Grateful Dead's American Beauty is playing in full.

",4.0,Mediterranean,Boulud Sud,4.7,"This is exactly why we will never be the guys who review restaurants for a “real” publication. For three months straight, all we’ve heard from anyone with a published opinion is how incredible Boulud Sud is. Funny though, how we haven’t heard much from friends or acquaintances. That probably should have been the first sign that we were going to pretty much hate this place.
Maybe our friends can’t afford to eat at Daniel Boulud’s restaurants. Or maybe they just don’t want to. Fine dining like this seems to only stimulate the old folks nowadays. It must evoke memories of better times, when eating at a world-class restaurant was expected to be a sterile, stuffy experience courtesy of a French chef. But world-class = stuffy no longer. This city is lousy with awesome restaurants that I wear dirty jeans to. And maybe that’s exactly why a place like Boulud Sud fails to impress us much. Let’s forget about the fact that the food was largely mediocre - I also don’t want a waiter that’s going to scoff at me for ordering wine by the glass. Guess what, asshole? I’m gonna drink six of these. And just because you bother me, I’m going to ask inconsequential questions about each one. “The family that owns the vineyard - what are they like? Are they nice? That’s great. Bring me something else.”
Ultimately, we are sure that Boulud Sud is some kind of Mediterranean culinary stroke of genius, just like the critics say that it is. But this is the kind of restaurant best suited for people who still keep an actual Zagat guide in their house. If you find yourself here with your parents, stick to the shared items and appetizers, from which there are some gems. Otherwise, plan to be unimpressed."

",2.0,Seafood,Upstate Craft Beer & Oyster Bar,8.5,"You might be wondering how it’s possible to grade a world-renowned restaurant like Per Se on the same scale as we would a tiny oyster and beer bar in the East Village. It’s quite simple, actually. Regardless of the level of sophistication or style of cuisine at any given establishment, it all comes down to whether or not a restaurant resonates with us. Upstate may be relatively unheard of and fit to seat less than twenty people at a time, but we think it deserves a high rating on this site. And assuming you aren’t here just to write us hate mail, we think you’re going to like it, too.
We can’t say enough good things about this place. The East Village needed a friendly neighborhood oyster bar in the worst way, and Upstate throws down like Amar’e with two hands. This one hits me right in the heart, too. I went to college upstate (Ithaca), and to find a bar that proudly serves Ithaca Caskzilla and Saranac on tap is a beautiful, beautiful thing. Everything served and sourced by Upstate is locally produced: cheese from Valley Shepard Creamery in New Jersey, meat and (incredible) pasta from Russo’s Mozzarella and Pasta on 11th street, Southhampton Beer, Wölffer wines - as long as it’s independent, small, and locally crafted, they can get on board with it.
There’s no big name restaurateur at Upstate (it’s actually the same guys who used to run Shaffer City), nor will you find gimmicks, a press release, or even a freezer for that matter. The simple menu is small and ever-changing, depending on what’s fresh and available. There are always oysters - usually over a dozen options from both the East and West coasts. Other staples include beer-steamed mussels, scallops, and a ridiculous fettuccine with clams. Every menu item costs less than twenty bucks, and literally every single thing we’ve tried has been delicious. For a true seafood lover, this is heaven.
When you go, you’ll no doubt meet Shane, who runs the joint. He’s the man. He’ll remember you after one visit. He recognized us right away after our first, brief stop-in. “Yeah, you guys were in here last week. You guys are movie stars or something, right?” Nope, and we will take that as a compliment even though it probably wasn’t one. We’re just two guys who are going to be sitting at your bar drinking beers and slurping oysters once a week for the foreseeable future."

Although it's lost a little of its luster recently, we still love Freemans. It ranks among our favorite restaurants of all time. We’ve got a lot of history here, and the food, although not 9.0 worthy as it was back when we started this site, is still really damn good. The artichoke dip is incredible, and the filet is just as awesome as you remember it. Yes, the whole rustic looking, upstate feeling, flannel wearing, bourbon drinking vibe Freemans nailed is often imitated, but it is never truly replicated. Bastard children of Lord Freeman pop up everywhere, and apparently even being a bus boy here qualifies you to go open a place of your own.
Freemans has been a key player in the restaurant renaissance we’re currently living in. It may not be a “secret” anymore, but this remains one of Manhattan’s elite dining experiences. And to us, it will always be worth the two-hour wait. Do people still wait that long to eat here?"

The only way to efficiently rock Ippudo these days is to tell your boss you have a doctors appointment and show up on a weekday at 4pm, ready to do bad things to your insides.

Over the years, I've definitely gotten a taste of their infamous sturgeon and smoked fish at Yom Kippur break-fast, but it's not in our regular rotation. What can I say, my family has always been a Zabar's kind of family. I called my Grandma (who you might remember from Grandma's On The Town) to get schooled on a little Greengrass back story.
Grandma: ""Barney Greengrass was the exemplar of Jewish food on the UWS. He was the first to introduce such delicacies as Sturgeon and smoked fish and the Jewish community went crazy for it. For an important occasion, my Aunt Reggy would go to Barney's and spend $20-30 on Sturgeon for the whole family (well over $100 now), and that was really the first time I can remember anyone in our family spending that kind of money of food. Barney never expanded the way Zabar's did though. Barney was always quite elite and the association was part of the reason my Aunt loved it so much. It's always been expensive. I always remember it as being a restaurant where celebrities dined, and it was famous for shipping an order of smoked fish to President Roosevelt.""
Thanks Grandma. Barney Greengrass is the definition of a [perfect_for slug =""classic-nyc-establishment""]Classic NYC Establishment[/perfect_for].

When it comes to eating, that Tribeca coolness can be both a good thing and a bad thing. It's a good thing when guys like Marco Canroa and Paul Grieco take their East Village wine bar Terroir and make it awesome to fit the neighborhood. It's a bad thing when nightlife magnates and hockey players simply try to open something trendy there because it will probably work. Warren 77 was to us, a perfect example of the bad. Bad food, bad layout, and a bad crowd put it on our list of least favorite places to eat in any neighborhood, let alone Tribeca. So when we found out that the very same owners had a new hot spot on West Broadway called Tiny's, we pretty much put it on our list of last places in the world to find Stang and Steinthal. However, in the interest of a fair shake, we made a few trips to Tiny's, and here is what we have to say.
Tiny's sucked less than we expected it to. The food is actually pretty damn good, and the space is awesome. It would be a great Tribeca place to hang...if it wasn't for the crowd. The restaurant is packed all the time, and the upstairs (where you will likely be offered a table, should you walk in) is a mess. It's often reserved for parties - mostly for girls who work at law firms and think bright red lipstick makes them look sexy (it doesn't). Don't take them up on that offer for an upstairs table, whatever you do. Wait for a place to sit in the far more sedate dining room, and chances are good that you'll have a solid meal. Just don't be surprised if your night gets spoiled because the joint is too crowded or because some dude can't say something without screaming it. In this kind of place, that comes with the territory."

Burke is certainly not afraid to take risks, and he has always had a flair for the dramatic. We’ve never been huge fans of his cooking, but had heard things about his farm-to-table “urban farmhouse” in the James Hotel...so we decided to check it out.
Even before stepping foot inside David Burke Kitchen, I was already turned off. The people I dealt with on the phone, on three different occasions, were all horribly rude. Pleasantry obviously isn’t something they value highly here. And this isn’t me being all emo and venting for no good reason, Yelp style. These people were legitimately awful, and they got worse each time. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted with a similarly cold, “I don’t really give a sh*t about you” attitude. 
Much like the restaurant itself, which is comprised of a huge loft-like dining room, a massive patio, and “The Treehouse” bar overlooking 6th Ave, the menu at David Burke Kitchen is a bit overwhelming. It took us a solid twenty minutes to digest the whole thing and come up with a game plan. We managed to make our way to a few winning plates (the Pretzel Crab Cake and the Scallops & Pork Belly were both tremendous), but we weren’t blown away overall. Most of the dishes had too many components and were way more style than substance. Also, our entire meal felt rushed. The staff was quick on the draw all night, trying to hijack unfinished plates and half-full drinks back to the kitchen prematurely
The bottom line? Go to Blue Hill or ABC Kitchen. David Burke Kitchen is not the place to have an incredible farm-to-table experience."

The magic that is the Westville family of recipes all started in a West Village space about the size of a small studio apartment. We can only imagine the copious amounts of weed which was probably smoked as the menu, which has a certain Birkenstock crunch to it, initially came together. Westville's diverse menu of hippie friendly staples, the same at all three locations, would go over just as well in the parking lot scene outside a Phish show as it has here in Manhattan. It's too bad goo-bars aren't one of the dessert options.

Although our Chronic Brunch ideals don't necessarily line up with the Meatpacking's booze fueled table dancing scene, we're always down to check places out with an open mind. We did some research and came to the conclusion that next time we were in the area and looking for early weekend eats, Paradou's Outdoor/Patio Situation was the call. The lesser of many evils, Paradou is nowhere near as in-your-face awful as many of its neighboring monkey cages. By Meatpacking standards, Paradou is a quaint little French bistro.
Some restaurants require multiple trips to figure out. Paradou isn't one of them. We had this place pegged the second we were led into the back garden and offered the ""unlimited champagne"" brunch special. What is it with Meatpacking and waiters in ridiculous sunglasses? I guess I shouldn't make fun, this guy hustled us hard. We bit on his sell of the $29 all you can drink champagne brunch. ""If you're getting a drink and entree anyway, it's only an extra $5 for free refills and our Paradou is amazing. Totally worth it"" he explained. In a moment of embarrassing weakness, we folded like tourists. When in Rome err Paris, right? Let's booze. He neglected to mention that this Paradou punch tastes like ass. I made better tasting jungle juice in college.
Luckily the food is better than the ParadouX, although that's not saying much. Standard bistro brunch fare is how it goes down at Paradou. Not bad, and after five glasses of champagne, probably incredible. For a Meatpacking boozy brunch, the scene here is reasonably tame. It's not the crazy party atmosphere we expected and there are definitely better places to go Laugh At Euros In Crazy Outfits. Paradou has its fair share of fashion offenders, but most (not all) appeared to come to Manhattan via train or bus, not airplane. It's not a place we'd go back to, but hey, if you need a reasonable option in Meatpacking, you can do much worse than Paradou."

And because they were around the corner from one another and named after a person, in my head, they were the same thing. Much like the whole Michelle Branch and Vanessa Carlton scenario. At least they had a little more in common.
But my stupid preconceived notions about this restaurant were dead wrong. Edi And The Wolf is actually quite Infatuation friendly. The restaurant has a great spirit to it. The main dining room, a sort of rag-tag urban garage with random sh*t everywhere, seems like a perfectly appropriate arena for drinking Austrian wines you've never heard of. The spooky back ""patio"" actually feels more like a haunted greenhouse. Meat hooks hang from a plastic ceiling that's patched together with umbrellas. It's weird, but it's cool. Even if you can't pronounce the majority of the menu options, don't be intimidated. This food is as accessible and familiar as any - the words for the dishes are just spelled crazy.
Here's another word for you - Gentrifizierung. That's German for gentrification, that is exactly what Edi And The Wolf is perpetuating in the East Village."

",3.0,Japanese,Nagomi,7.5,"OK so that isn’t really a photo of Nagomi, but we couldn’t find any real pictures of the restaurant and decided to buy this gem off a stock photo site instead. It was labeled “young attractive couple dating,” which is curious, considering that none of those people look particularly young or attractive. We kind of want our money back.
The lack of any information about a restaurant on the whole of the internet is usually a bad sign – an indication that the place is either closed or hiding their existence from the IRS. Neither of those things appear to be true for Nagomi. This is a non-descript sushi restaurant on Prince Street that can be summed with one new tag on this website: Perfect For When You Can’t Get In to Blue Ribbon Sushi. But this place is actually pretty damn good, and can serve as a stand-in for the high-end places in a pinch. We rolled in on a night when Blue Ribbon was rocking a ninety minute wait and were impressed with everything we ate. You won’t get the same atmosphere or trademark kitchen dishes some of the other more well known places around here offer, but you also won’t get hit with the same price tag at the end. More money for giant Sapporos."

",1.0,Mexican,Zaragoza Grocery,7.3,"We do a lot of complaining about NYC's Mexican food. We can cry all day long, but nothing's gonna change. NYC has gourmet Mexican covered, we don't need anymore El Toro Blancos serving three tacos for $16 and margaritas that cost double digits. What we need are taquerias on every corner like pizza joints. However, the reality is, selling tacos for $3 a pop isn't a sustainable business model in Manhattan. That's just fact.
Instead of taquerias on every corner, our city has bodegas. Bodegas we usually won't consider buying much more than a bottle of water and box of cereal from. Unless, of course, they're of the Mexican variety. I lived in the East Village for five years before realizing Zaragoza was more than just a dirty looking deli. I walked by every day, without even considering entry. Don't always judge a book by its cover. Zaragoza is an excellent place for a quick Taco Fix in the East Village. Although eating in is an option, this should only be thought of as a Serious Take-Out Operation.

It’s not entirely their fault that Mexican food in this city isn’t the best, however, they’re certainly public enemy #1. Plenty of people love Dos Caminos, and good for them. They’re not the ones you should be taking restaurant advice from.
Even though you may not choose to dine at Dos Caminos, Dos Caminos inevitably chooses you. Office happy hours you didn’t plan, random birthday parties you need to show face at, or perhaps an utter lack of options, as was the case for us before a Highline Ballroom show. Turns out, the Meatpacking edition is the biggest bust yet, making it impossible to ignore any longer.
As we’re all well aware, the Meatpacking District, especially during summer, is completely out of control. It seems to get more ridiculous with each passing hour and begs the question: Is this sh*t for real?
As usual, the food on a recent visit was a snooze and service laughably bad. We sat outside for a solid 15 minutes before finally flagging down a server. They must hire anyone with a resume claiming they spent spring break at The Oasis Cancun as this is a terrible operation.
This Dos Caminos is a microcosm of everything that’s wrong with the Meatpacking District. Who knew a bad restaurant could be Perfect For so many different things. Whatever, at least it’s entertaining."

See, before Colonie, Brooklyn Heights did not have its own Frankies 457, or Marlow and Sons, or Prime Meats. There wasn’t really a good Date Night spot or Chronic Brunch destination unless you walked nearly six blocks into Cobble Hill. And for Brooklyn, that just seems ridiculous.
So Colonie opened its doors, earned itself one star from the Times, and is now consistently packed for dinner every night. Much like those other staple Brooklyn neighborhood spots, it can be tough to get a table, and it's not a cheap meal. But also like those other spots, Colonie is really f*cking good. We love both dinner and brunch here, from the drinks all the way to the dessert. The restaurant is comfortable and interesting, the staff is cool, and we love sitting at the open kitchen counter, downing lambrusco and watching our food come to life. The key seems to be in smart ordering, so ask your waiter for some guidance, or use the Food Rundown within. We happened to sit directly in front of the chef on our last visit, and he wasn't afraid to tell us what we should and shouldn't order.

A Jamaican restaurant, Miss Lily’s is modeled after the West Indian eateries in Brooklyn and The Bronx and is owned by the dude from La Esquina and a few nightclub kingpins. The result of that combination is a very sceney place where good looking people can go eat spicy Caribbean food and stare at each other. But despite that being the case, we couldn’t help but be impressed with how well the concept is executed - and how tasty the food is. Most everything we tried landed somewhere between good and great, and the aesthetic of the restaurant is one of the smartest we’ve seen in this town. The front bar area is an excellent facsimile of a jerk chicken take-out counter, and the vibey back room is papered with old ska and reggae album covers, much like my living room might be if I smoked more weed. And even though it tends to be a little hot and sweaty, this is an undeniably cool place to hang out. Just don’t expect it to be your go-to spot for jerk chicken on the cheap.

",2.0,American,Brindle Room,4.5,"Considering there’s very little ground left un-Infatuated in the East Village, we were quite intrigued by a recent flurry of recommendations coming in on behalf of Brindle Room. Our people must be smoking the good mongo because there’s no way sane people like this place. The dinner we had here recently was one of the more unimpressive meals we’ve had in recent memory. It was downright painful and took f-o-r-e-v-e-r. You remember the feeling of being in class when that was the last place in the world you wanted to be? Where minutes felt like hours and the uncomfortable knot in your chest kept getting worse? Right, that’s how the two hours we spent at Brindle Room felt. The food, which sucked, took eons to get to us and when we were finally ready to make our getaway, our credit cards were hijacked. Tack on an extra 15 minutes as a going away present. Thanks for nothing Brindle Room.
Not much makes much sense at Brindle Room. They try and jam as many seats as possible into this skinny, awkward space and they do it with uncomfortable elevated seating. There are tiny bar spaces up front and along the wall, which barely have enough table space to fit a drink, let alone a plate of food. Not surprisingly, there wasn’t a single human wedged into any of these spots. From the outside, it looks like an inviting space, but inside it’s the complete opposite. The decor is anti-cozy, and the dark brown color scheme looks cheap and boring. But the food is what really got me. As you’ll soon read, most of it was completely inedible. If it wasn’t for a very delicious burger, which I went back a second time to try, this could have been one of the lowest ratings ever. While it’s still getting tagged as Perfect For Wasting Your Time and Money, two full burger points put Brindle Room’s rating safely in the fours.
The bottom line is that this restaurant is amateur hour at its finest. From the service, to the execution and everything in-between. We’re really not that hard to please, but Brindle Room failed on multiple levels. Aside from great food, the most important part of a restaurants existence is careful attention to detail. Apparently Brindle Room didn’t get the memo."

",4.0,Spanish,Degustation,4.2,"Degustation is a polarizing place. You either love it, or you hate it like it said something mean about your sister. That's usually a bad sign when it comes to restaurants - an indication of inconsistency or fickle concept. But the concept at Degustation is pretty straightforward. It's an inventive, high-end Spanish food experience in the vein of what's made José Andrés a famous man, despite the fact that he sounds like a cartoon bull fighter when he talks.
So then logic would follow that inconsistency is what's causing all those differing opinions on Degustation. And from our perspective, that's absolutely true. That and the fact that the ten course tasting menu ($75) is the only way you get treated with any respect in this place. The five course tasting ($50) is an exercise in eating all of the cheapest things on the menu, and ordering a la carte will pretty much get you thrown out of the restaurant. Add in a staff that's cold and inattentive, and you end up with a scenario where the food better be incredible or you're gonna be pissed. Unfortunately, it's not. Or maybe the food is incredible, but the execution is so poor that you don't even notice. On our last visit we sat at the open kitchen watching the staff go from bored to completely frenzied every four minutes or so. You shouldn't pace a tasting menu by firing my next course just in time for me to forget the one I just ate.
For us, it really comes down to the fact that spending this kind of money should mean consistency. I either want a celebrity chef with broken English cooking my food, or I want to roll into Casa Mono and drop dollars on a meal that I know is going to be incredible. And if I'm really dying to hit a serious tasting menu, I'll leave it to two dudes behind the counter at Momofuku Ko to make my head spin. This place I can do without.
Squab with Dirty Rice
Some nicely cooked pieces of bird, atop a skillet of decent dirty rice, or not-so-crunchy paella. We liked, but we didn't love.Some Kind of White Fish
I honestly can't remember what this fish was, but it very well could have been bass. The reason I can't remember is that I had to wait fifteen minutes between courses to get it, and then the girl at the counter put it in front of us like we didn't deserve it. There were some tapioca balls in there, which made it unique, but not more delicious.Pork Belly
A fan favorite, and one that you won't get unless you order the ten course tasting menu. Choose wisely.Carmelized Torija
The best thing we've had at Degustation comes during dessert. This thing is like the perfect marriage of crème brulee and bread pudding, and we'd eat it by the wheelbarrow if we could. Amazing."

If not, just ask one of the 200 people you know who went to Syracuse - they’ll tell you all about it. Back in my Ithaca College days, we’d drive up to ’Cuse for three reasons: the mall, concerts, and (obviously) the original Dinosaur BBQ.
This Harlem branch manages to stave off Manhattan compromise and maintains every ounce of the free spirited, upstate sensibilities Dinosaur is known and loved for. It’s a breath of fresh air in the way it would be if a roadside carnival with a ferris wheel were to appear on 2nd Avenue in place of you standard street fair that sells tube socks and underwear. Who buys socks at those things?
But know that Dinosaur BBQ isn’t the best barbecue you’ll ever eat. It’s not even the best in Manhattan. It is, however, our kind of dining establishment.

The majority of the restaurants in this area will either make you a) pissed that you weren't born to live a life of leisure, or b) jealous that your neighborhood isn't full of sickeningly cute French cafes. Don't get us wrong, we love spending our mornings at Cafe Cluny and hanging out at Fedora every once in a while. But it's easy to get stumped down here when you need a place to take someone that you aren't trying to make out with/convince that you are rich. Which is precisely why we were so happy to stumble across Takashi recently.
We are becoming increasingly familiar these days with the art of Korean barbeque, and have decided that there are some things we really like about it. Namely, grilled meat with delicious sauces and rice. But we also happen to be a little bit fancy, and we hate smelling like we've been camping for three days after sitting in front of a smoky grill in K-Town. Takashi might just have been created with us specifically in mind. This tiny, modern restaurant is a Japanesey Korean hybrid, with high tech grills at each table that look like they were designed by Dyson. The menu is wholly dedicated to the magic of high end beef, and you can grill up all the best parts of a well-bred cow at your table, yet still go somewhere after and not smell like a forest fire. This is truly adventurous eating at its best, with all kinds of offal and raw beef dishes that some people go crazy for. But Takashi is still a perfect place in the West Village to hit with some friends, even if they're more conservative diner types. Just make sure they stick to the familiar cuts and go heavy on the sake."

",3.0,Seafood,Ed's Lobster Bar,6.6,"We've put this one off long enough and it's time to come right out and say it
- we don't love Ed's Lobster Bar. Apologies to those of you who do, we know we're in the minority here. Ed just doesn't do it for us the way Mary, Pearl, or Luke does.
There isn't much we love more than a good seafood shack. In fairness to Ed, it's not that easy to pull off a successful one, especially a lobster focused one, within the urban confines of this cement city. Are you ever really in the mood to get a full pound and a half lobster when you're in Manhattan, freshly off the pee smelling, rat infested subways? Lobster is most enjoyable when you can smell the ocean from which it came.
Lobster rolls are an extremely subjective delicacy. Everyone is entitled to their own personal preference. One of our all time favorites comes from Lunch in Amagansett. It's a mayo heavy, finely chopped lobster salad that you either love or don't understand. In Manhattan, Mary's Fish Camp and Luke's Lobster, while very different, make the rolls our dreams are made of. Ed's light on the mayo, heavy on the meat roll just isn't on the same level in our humble opinion. We've been back a bunch, just to make certain, and every time we're left with the same disappointing feeling. And the rest of the menu leaves us with that same empty feeling. It's all reasonable ocean fare, but none of it leaves us anxiously awaiting next time.
New England Clam Chowder
I've had this a couple of times over the years, and each time it's been a little different. Not once has it been particularly good. Too chunky, too thin, too cold - there's always something a little off about Ed's chowder.PEI Mussels with Horseradish Cream Sauce
At $10, this is a hefty sized serving of mussels. However, for as good as horseradish cream sauce sounds, the thin broth didn't actually taste like anything. We had to dump tons of the extra horseradish that comes on the side on each mussel to give these things any semblance of flavor.Lobster Roll
As discussed above, we're not crazy about Ed's lobster roll. The bun is lightly toasted and perfectly buttered and you get tons of lobster, but it's pretty much mayo and seasoning free. Also, the lobster chunks are huge, which makes some people happy, but not us. Big chewy lobster knuckles aren't what we look for in a lobster rolls...that's a cop out. I want claw meat.Oven Roasted Montauk Bluefish
Finally, a dish that's seasoned correctly. If you find yourself at Ed's and looking for a non-lobster choice, this is the way to go. Maybe because truffle salt.Ed's Slaw/Pickles
The slaw is whatever. Nothing to write home about. On the other hand, the pickles are incredible. Enjoy them in house, or take them home with you. They're for sale by the bottle."

",3.0,Mexican,Empellon Taqueria,7.4,"There’s some Real Housewives caliber drama surrounding Chef Alex Stupak’s new West Village Mexican joint Empellon right about now. It all blew up last week when a blogger invited himself into Stupak’s kitchen only to accuse him of being a traitor to his craft (Stupak was formerly master pastry chef atwd-50). Stupak rightfully defended himself  and then other chefs allegedly called him a “douche.“ In the food world, this is equivalent to some RH Jersey table flipping drama.
As we’re all well aware, Mexican food in Manhattan generally blows. Empellon hasn’t come to save the day, but it isn’t adding to the problem either. Offering a straight forward menu of fancy-ish Mexican dishes, it’s a welcome addition to a hurting West Village roster including Diablo Royale and Maracas, both of which Empellon is significantly better than. While nothing blew us away, the food was solid with the good outweighing the bad. The guacamole was perfect and the signature cocktails and margaritas are excellent. One thing that should always be on the menu? Scotch egg taco. That was the best bite of the night. On the flip side, the tacos are too expensive. Fully stuffed or not, $12 for two is just too much. Also, the
wait staff needs to be a little more disciplined and pay attention to detail.
Constantly having to flag down the help because they’re not showing your table love is annoying.
The crowd is standard West Village, similar to what you’ll find overflowing from  Wilfie and Nell next door. We spotted dudes in identical J-Crew button downs sitting back to back, both on what appeared to be First/Early in the Game Dates and numerous tables full of ladies letting loose on Girls’ Night Out.
Only time will tell if Stupak can prove the haters wrong. In the meantime, don’t sleep on the late night menu. Tacos at 1am are always a good thing."

This specific block of 6th Avenue is primo See And Be Seen real estate. Da Silvano, is next door - a restaurant that you'd have to pay us to eat at.

Despite being well known for Celebrity Sightings, it's the food, Pitti's classic Italian dishes, that's the real draw.
The crowds out front might suggest that Pitti is an absolute mob scene, but it's really not as bad as it looks. Bar Pitti turns over tables like clockwork. There's never that long of a wait.

But there are a select few reasons to make a trip to Eataly and risk getting in a street fight with a European tourist over your table. Is La Pizza & Pasta one of them? No. But La Verdure is. More on that another time.
La Pizza & Pasta is exactly what they say it is - a restaurant inside Eataly that specializes in Neapolitan pizzas and both fresh and dry pasta dishes. The food is perfectly decent, even pretty damn good at times. But the problem here comes down to volume. A trip to La Pizza & Pasta feels like going to eat at Terminal 7 of JFK, and having to go through Times Square on New Years Eve to get there. There are people everywhere, and this place turns out a pizza every thirty seconds to feed them all. What you end up with is a meal that you can tell would be a whole lot better if they could afford to slow down. The upside is that there are a few good pies that you really can't go wrong with, and the wine list is actually fantastic and affordable (thought you probably won't want to linger). Our suggestion is to either roll up solo and eat at the bar, or take the stuff to go. You won't walk away happy if it costs you 45 minutes and thirty dollars worth of shit you accidentally knocked off the shelves just waiting to eat here.

And apparently the new proprietors settled on the concept for this restaurant as soon as the old place closed - because that’s right about when this Gangs of New York restaurant trend was still interesting.
As I wrote this review, I actually found myself wanting to write some of the very same things about Monument Lane that I said about Goat Town. It’s a nice space and all, but it seems that some reclaimed wood, an antique musket, and a trip to the public library are the easiest way to a restaurant idea these days. We’re over it.
Luckily, the food at Monument Lane is more successful than at Goat Town. The menu is inspired by Civil War era New York and the use of local ingredients (because that’s all they could use then!), but to us it just felt like refined bar food and comfort eating. The signature meatloaf is solid, and we liked the fish we ate quite a bit, but the most satisfying things on the menu were the things you should eat while you are focused on drinking. This makes for a restaurant that’s perfectly fine for a meal in the neighborhood, but only Perfect For having a drink and some food at the bar before you head out for the night.

We didn’t know our clam nomenclature well enough, and ordered these thinking we would get a half dozen delicious little guys to start the meal. Apparently Cherrystone clams are the ones that look like phallic sea monsters. These were easily as big as the palm of your hand. We’re down with shellfish, but not ones that you need to chew. Maybe you are. Have fun with that.Poutine
Apparently there were some Canadians around during Civil War era West Village. Was Canada even a country then? Is it now? Either way, we’ll take cheese, gravy and french fries any time.Monument Lane Meatloaf

Lately we've been looking to further expand our horizons and get to other parts of this city. Ditmas Park is certainly an ""other part"" of the city...at least to us. So our aforementioned, Brooklyn-dwelling friend recommended The Farm on Adderley for a Sunday brunch excursion, and we jumped at the opportunity to go this deep into BK with someone we knew could actually get us back.What we found was a really good, comfortable restaurant in a neighborhood that seems to have relatively few of those. Brunch was packed, and we're told it's been busy since the day they opened their doors several years ago. Though the place isn't named for an actual farm, the kitchen leans heavy on local and seasonal ingredients, and the food has a bit of a rustic slant. We loved our meal here and instead of going back a few times for dinner, decided to write it up solely based on brunch.

We had high expectations due to Meyer’s flawless record, but flaws were found, and the verdict was levied accordingly. Steinthal actually compared the place to every great band’s worst album. Ouch.
But what I’ve come to realize, after a bunch of recent visits, is that maybe this is a perfect example of when the “critics” (we refuse to actually call ourselves that) were wrong. Maybe Maialino is really Paul’s Boutique or Weezer’s Pinkerton. Those now legendary albums were both panned early on, but lived on to become respected as works of greatness, regardless of early opinion. The only problem with that theory is that we were pretty much the only ones that didn’t like Maialino from the start. Ignore everything I just said. Maybe we’re just that fat record store clerk that hates everything.
There are a few specific things that changed our mind on Maialino and led to this re-review. First of all, we know way too many people that count this place among their favorite restaurants in the city to ignore that. Second, we had an incredible brunch here last year and felt the need to come back in for dinner. A handful of visits later, and we were ready to atone for our sins - but that’s not to say that there aren’t still some flaws. It’s almost impossible to get a reservation at a decent hour here, and we find their wine pours to be annoyingly shallow. The crowd is also typically a strange mix of one Olsen twin and a bunch of old guys that wear stonewashed jeans and suede driving shoes.

It’s a big enough space to allow for standing room only, and there always seems to be a table open, or a short wait for one at worst. We’ve always enjoyed our times at Clover Club over the years. It’s been a go-to post-dinner destination for all Carroll Gardens and Cobble Hill meals, and it should be one of yours as well."

",4.0,Italian,Ai Fiori,7.7,"Avid Infatuation readers know by now that we love ourselves some Michael White. For us, it doesn't get much better than a meal that involves a heavy dose of the big man's pasta. Marea is one of our absolute favorite restaurants in Manhattan, and we also gave high marks to his downtown meatopia, Osteria Morini. So you can imagine that expectations were sky high for White's new hotel restaurant, Ai Fiori.
Unlike the charming, cozy Morini, Ai Fiori is a sprawling space with more room than they know what to do with. The bathrooms are bigger than both of our apartments combined. There also seems to be around 2,000 people on staff, and the amount of dinner and glassware on site could challenge the stock room at Bloomingdales. But it's clear that Ai Fiori could be the (large) show that White takes on the road. Set inside The Setai, this is a bit of a cookie cutter hotel restaurant, and it's got all the makings of a chain that could work anywhere in the world...not just NYC. Don't get us wrong, that's not necessarily a bad thing - it worked just fine for Wolfgang Puck and Bobby Flay. But this isn't a place we'll be hanging out a lot - it's not our crowd. However, for a business man with a hot little pant suit number on his arm or a crew of white-haired couples, Ai Fiori is perfect."

If you’re not wearing a suit or carrying a corporate card, chances are you feel like an alien when you try and take a step up from Cafe Metro. Lately, though, an influx of cool has started to sneak its way into this wasteland. Momofuku’s Má Pêche is always solid, we have an Ippudo, and Geoffrey Zakarian has reinvented himself with a new Midtown mini-empire including an impressive Times Square showing in The Lambs Club and now The National as well.
The National is essentially Midtown’s Five Points. It's a seasonal restaurant and brasserie with solid eats at prices that aren’t cheap but aren’t abusive. It’s money for lunch, dinner, and even weekday breakfast, something that isn’t easy to locate in the mid-50s. The service is excellent
- we always feel well taken care of on our visits. Plus, the food is all solid, particularly the pork chop. God damn is it good.
It’s certainly true that if The National was downtown, it would hardly stand out amongst a sea of decent bistro/cafe style joints. But up here, this place is pretty special. Get it in your rotation."

",4.0,Italian,Da Umberto,7.9,"Old school Italian restaurants. This city is full of them, and everyone has a favorite. Except us, that is. For whatever reason, this sort of dining has never appealed to us for much more than something to do with your third cousins when they come to visit from wherever third cousins come from. I guess it’s the fact that a meal in a place like Il Mulino or John’s can sometimes feel like little more than a really expensive reason to take a nap. Plus, Jay Z hasn’t invited us up to Rao’s yet, and we’re kind of holding out for that.
But recently, we were turned on to a cult favorite of this type, Da Umberto. Yes, this is old school Italian eating (Tuscan to be exact), but this is definitely more our speed. Unlike a lot of other Little Italy and classic New York Italian joints, Da Umberto foregoes some of the shtick often found in these restaurants, and is pleasantly devoid of any pictures of the owner standing with Chazz Palminteri. It’s actually a very classy spot with low lights and a contemporary vibe - appropriate even for a First/Early in the Game Date, assuming you are with someone who finds being wasted on red wine and truffles attractive. The food at Da Umberto is solid, and refreshingly relies on quality ingredients to make an impression, rather than lots of crushed red pepper and “gravy”. We were also impressed with the fact that the very friendly, very Italian staff manages to pull off “attentive” without coming across like this. Go to Little Italy sometime and tell me that you aren’t scared that half those guys are either going to rob you or kiss you on the mouth. Or both."

During brunch hours, it’s not uncommon for people to wait two hours for the pure, fluffy cakes of ecstasy that this place is known for. We won’t join them...but we can’t blame them either. The pancakes alone make this place a top Chronic Brunch venue in Manhattan.
After being told there was a long wait for brunch at 3:30pm on a Saturday a few years back, CSBC was officially relegated to an afterthought for us. Maybe if they were handing out freshly baked goods on the street, it’d be worth waiting around, but they don’t, so coming here on a weekend is completely out of the question. Like you, we don’t have that kind of time to waste.
But those pancakes can only remain an afterthought for so long. We had recently been thinking about those big beautiful things a whole lot, and it was time for a fix without the wait. Weekday breakfast was the move, and hot damn, was it ever. Talk about starting the day off right. The place is close enough to the F train to be convenient to Midtown, and a weekday meal means you aren’t waiting around like a crazy person. Book a breakfast meeting just for the hell of it.
For those living on the Lower East Side or EastVillage,Clinton St. Baking Company is also a useful lunch and dinner standby, delivering quality food across the board. It’s a charming little establishment, family owned and operated by a husband and wife team who put that little extra love into their food to make you remember it and want to come back."

No stranger to Midtown (The National, Le Cirque), Geoffrey Zakarian’s Lambs Club kitchen is consistently very good - maybe even just short of excellent. The food is pricey, but that’s to be expected in this neck of the woods. The cocktails are also stupid expensive (some over $16), and the wine list is crazy, too. We did, however, manage to find an incredible bottle of 1999 Bordeaux from Chateau La Vieille Cure for under $100. That’s a steal relative to the rest of the options and is a fine treat for the table. Especially if it’s being written off.
The designers of this place took a big chance putting this room together they way they did. The decor teeters on the brink of typical, “restaurant inside a hotel” cheesy. In photos, it may come across a little forced, but in reality, it’s actually quite perfect. With deep red, ridiculously comfortable booths and a big fireplace, they did well with a modern take on a throwback vibe. Props to The Lambs Club for rolling the dice - it’s those who take risks in life that often come out on top.
So for Midtown suits or big baller entertainment industry types, The Lambs Club is the place to be. It’s also a prime candidate for pre-theatre eats. And yes - it’s rare that we back this type of restaurant - but The Lambs Club is officially Infatuation approved."

We nearly made that mistake, but the guy in the street level Japanese restaurant looked so surprised to see customers, we figured something was up. Head up the narrow stairs, and you should find a packed house full of people that look really happy. That's Yakitori Totto.
These kinds of places can be tricky for us to review. It's much harder to make hilarious pop culture references and sarcastic generalizations when you really have no idea what the f*ck is going on around you. We love Japanese food and Japanese culture, but let's put it this way - our answer to ""what kind of sake would you like"" is usually, ""the middle one.""
Nonetheless, we embrace the unknown. Yakitori Totto has come highly recommended by some of our most trusted allies, all who swear by the authenticity of the place. Clearly their specialty is ""yakitori"" - a Japanese term for meat (and other things) grilled on a stick. And that's what you should be sticking to. The menu is full of Japanese specialties and interesting starters and salads, but what you need to do is dive right in on the skewers. There are tons of options to choose from, ranging from chicken thighs to chicken gizzards, enoki mushrooms and beef tongue. We recommend that you lean heavy on the chicken selections, and don't be afraid to roll the dice on something weird. That ""soft knee bone"" might actually be pretty delicious."

Rumors of its potential ""the rent is too damn high"" demise return every year, but, thankfully, it's still alive and well. That pastrami sandwich wouldn't taste as good uprooted to a new location.
There's no point in preaching Katz's. The majority of the people who read The Infatuation know the drill. With an operation as brash and unapologetic as this one, inevitably, you're either a huge fan or big time hater - there isn't much middle ground. Naturally, we're huge fans.

She'd been a regular on 2nd Ave and 10th street since her NYU days in the 1940's, and felt tradition deserved more respect than that. She wasn't the only one channeling nostalgic rage - it seemed like the whole city was pissed off. And for good reason. There are only so many Classic NYC Establishments left, and with each that disappears, so does a piece of Gotham history.
Although the new Murray Hill digs aren't quite the same, at least 2nd Ave Deli is back in business. The old school charm may be gone, but the matzoh ball soup and pastrami sandwich have remained pretty much untouched. Pickles and cole slaw remain fixtures on each table and the waitstaff is just as senile as they were in the East Village. It's funny, some people are under the impression that NYC has the best deli's in the world, which is far from the truth. The average bodega deli around these parts makes Lenny's actually seem like a good option. However, nowhere in the world will you find better, or more obnoxious, Jewish delis than in the Big Apple.

If our favorite can't survive, (Mercadito Cantina RIP), we have a hard time believing newcomers like Diablo Royal and El Camion will live long, healthy lives. Hell, even La Lucha, as good and cheap as it is, seems to be having a tough time.
Don't get me wrong, we're always down to try new Mexican food in the hood. But, this is one of those restaurants that begs the question of - why? Why is this restaurant opening? For no other reason but to occupy space for a few years before its eventual closure? Nothing stands out. All the food is dreadfully average at best. I mean, we left uneaten tacos littered across the table - which is a rarity - we're usually members of the clean plate club. The highlight of the meal was the drinks, and not because they were particulartly awesome, but because they were big and priced right. So, as you can tell, we don't see the point to this place. If you're going to open a new Mexican joint in the East Village these days, you best bring your A-Game. El Camion, good luck.
Calamari Crispy
Why sample calamari at a Mexican restaurant? Not sure, but it was a bad move as we either had a lame batch, or this calamari crispy should have been called calamari rubbery.El Camion Wings Tamarind
Not bad, but not good enough to save this review. The bbq glaze was tasty enough. If I came here again, I'd probably order these. Tacos al Pastor Orange
Tacos are supposed to be grenades of goodness exploding in your mouth, not tasteless, dry, boring handfuls of nothingness. Someone might want to let El Camion know that.Baja Style Fish Tacos
Way too much flour tortilla, way too much avocado crema, not enough fried cod. Another taco fail.Grilled Chicken Fajitas
This was worse than the tacos. A tiny serving of dry chicken and close to nonexistent onions and peppers. You can buy better fajitas in the frozen foods aisle of your local Associated grocery store."

So, as it goes when you've got a hot concept, Socarrat has begun its sprawl with a wine bar adjacent to its Chelsea flagship and a new, comparatively spacious location in Nolita.
This Nolita location is exciting news for a few reasons, most notably that it's much larger and they take reservations. No more bumping elbows at Socarrat Chelsea's communal table and praying you don't get seated next to a lefty. Right? Wrong.
The food at Socarrat Nolita is just as good as it is on the west side, and they even have a few exclusive paellas that we really like. But despite all that extra space, they have inexplicably occupied 40% of the room with a communal table. Now, we're all for group dining with strangers, but the only way you are having a comfortable meal sitting at this thing is if you have the body frame of Beaker from The Muppets. They need to pull about five stools away from the equation so you and your date won't have to deal with the lady next to you breathing on your calamari.
Speaking of dates, we don't recommend coming here with a party of two, just for the simple fact that you're pretty much guaranteed to sit with the strangers. Come in a party of three or four, and you should be dining comfortably at a table made for people with shoulders. A good thing, considering you will be eating from a giant pan.
Pan Tomaca
Also known as pan con tomate. These are crunchy, smallish crostinis with a pretty good amount of tomato guts spread on top. We typically like this kind of thing, but have had better versions elsewhere. Namely, Casa Mono and Spain.Paella de Langosta
This is the new lobster paella available at Socarrat Nolita. It's also got a whole sh*tload of other high end goodness from the sea, which is why it's the most expensive pan at $28 per person. It's worth it if you feel like getting your hands dirty on some langostines and cockles. If not, go for something less tactile like the Arroz Negro.Paella de Cordero

is. There are pleated trousers and penny loafers all over this joint. Yep, I

order correctly.
We come here for one meal, and one meal only. A caesar salad and a pizza. I

far. And they have a brick oven in the middle of the restaurant turning out
pizzas that keep up with some of the better Neapolitan style places in town.

I think Casa Mono was restaurant review number five on the site. But now that we're a strong (and fussy) toddler, I suppose it's time we got around to it.
Basically, Bar Jamón is Casa Mono's waiting room. Most restaurants have a bar area where people can hang, drink, and wait for a table. In Casa Mono's case, that bar is around the corner, and has a different name. Bar Jamón is a tiny, crowded little room with a few communal tables and some ledges near which you can sit or stand. It's is definitely a great place to drink and snack while you wait for your table at Casa Mono, but in our opinion, it's even better for something else.
Have you ever had one of those nights where you're meeting someone on a  directly after work? A sit down dinner feels too formal, but you know if you don't eat anything you're going to be wasted after two drinks and talking way too much about how you hate cats? Me neither. But just in case you do come across that situation, know that Bar Jamón is there for you. It's a great middle ground between just drinks, and drinks with some food.

",3.0,Japanese,1 Or 8,5.4,"1 Or 8 is a crazy looking, modern Japanese restaurant which recently opened in Williamsburg. Chances are, you've likely never seen or heard of it before because it's in the middle of nowhere. Design-wise, think hipsters in Antarctica (that's kind of an awesome band name). Although it doesn't seem to have hit the mainstream radar, we'd heard from multiple Infatuation informants that it was dope, so, naturally, we went and scoped it out for the good of the people.
We trudged out to Billyburg in the middle of a blizzard, witnessing an impressive sidewalk wipe-out or two on the way (always entertaining). You shouldn't waste your time doing the same. It's a shame too, because we wanted to like 1 Or 8. The space is cozy, with comfortable booths, friendly staff and an affordable $32, four course tasting menu Mon-Weds. Unfortunately, we have higher standards in the service and food departments. We expect our waiters to have answers and our pork entrees to be soft and tender, not thick and rubbery. You'll read more about that pork entree below, but that was the beginning of the end for 1 Or 8. Additionally, our waiter had zero knowledge of the menu; with every simple question we proposed he scampered into the kitchen to consult the chef. Amateur hour. Not to harp on the poor guy, but he was tragically awkward and clearly ill-prepared to battle the elements in Antarctica. We would have happily looked past this if the food was great. It wasn't and therefore we're annoyed. The sushi and roll combinations we tried were fine, but not next level like we were hoping for. For the locals, 1 Or 8 is surely a nice addition to a rather sushi-less area. However, for those of us who have to travel, 1 Or 8 is completely out of the question. You can do way better at the same price point in Manhattan.
Hamachi Ceviche
The ceviches on the whole were interesting, but they were closer to raw fish salads than standard crevices. They're served in small salad bowls and contain more ingredients than usual, in this case daikon radish, celery and woodear mushroom in a chive sauce, all of which overshadows the fish.Octopus Ceviche
Another OK ceviche, this one with grapes, Japanese yam in a tosa vinegar gelée. It can easily be skipped without feeling bad. We made the mistake of going ceviche over tartare, which was probably the wrong move.Pork Belly Two Ways
This is where the meal went from OK to bad. It was being pushed as a house favorite too, which is pretty mind blowing as this is easily the worst pork meal I've had in recent memory. One half was served ""a la plancha,"" which apparently means thick and rubbery like car tire. It was gross. All fat, thick fat, and no tenderness. The other half was a fried cutlet - you ever had a fried pork cutlet before? Me either. There's a reason why pork isn't best served fried, because it's dry and generally not good. Add in sauerkraut and a confusing spicy green apple sauce and you've got the recipe for absolute disaster. Avoid at all costs.Miso Black Cod
A true test for any Japanese restaurant, the great ones destroy this dish and the rest just do it. This is a good example of the latter.Specialty Rolls 
Both the Double Salmon (salmon skin, cucumber, shiso, topped with salmon and a wasabi cream sauce) and Yellow Mango (yellowtail, mango, jalapeno with cilantro sauce) rolls are solid. A little on the small side, but tasty.Sashimi
Again, the fish wasn't bad. It just wasn't amazing. There is a nice list of options, but you can getter better fish at the same price in Manhattan at places like Kanoyama in the East Village.Vegetarian Sushi

It’s amazing how one photo can really sum a place up. Beauty & Essex opened in December, just down the street from the owner’s first establishment, Stanton Social. Some restaurants celebrate their opening by inviting friends and family, others hope that TMZ shows up. Looks like they did a pretty good job showing off all the famous people they know (paid).
Clearly, what I am getting at is that Beauty & Essex is a spectacle. One of almost unprecedented proportion. This place is ridiculous. Like a ground level Boom Boom Room with food and slightly poorer people. The idea is that you walk into what sort of looks like a pawn shop, and the door opens into a massive, luxurious mega restaurant. There are two levels, two huge dining rooms, and three bars. One of which is in the women’s bathroom, and pours free champagne for all the ladies. Seriously. We didn’t believe it either until we saw a bunch of girls stumble out with half empty glasses and crooked lipstick. Then we checked out the men’s room hoping to find some free beers or something, and it might as well have been two buckets and a stack of paper towels in there. I guess they know who to keep happy.
But you want to know the worst part about it all? The food is actually pretty good. It’s easy to tee up on a place like this when the food sucks (see Standard Grill), but we honestly can’t hate on the meals we had at Beauty & Essex. You’ll find a creative menu with a lot of options, none of which will be written up in Saveur anytime soon, but most good enough to impress even your drunkest friends. We actually had a steak that could qualify as excellent. See how mature we’re being? We’re not even going to complain about how ridiculously expensive everything is. Gotta pay for those fur lined walls somehow.
Grilled Flatbread
A decent pizza type thing with a super thin crust. What it’s topped with seems to rotate, but on our visit there was bacon, apples and some Maytag blue cheese. Not bad, but you can do better.Thai Lobster Bisque Dumplings
I suppose this is a play on soup dumplings, with Thai flavors. Not the most amazing dumpling we’ve ever had, but you probably won’t be mad at it - as long as you don’t care about the price tag.Braised Short Rib Tamales
We like short ribs. We like tamales. No brainer.Bone Marrow
Roasted bone marrow, toast, marmalade. This might have earned Beauty & Essex a whole rating point. Order it.Steaks
If you’re going for an entree at Beauty & Essex, go for a steak. Otherwise, don’t bother and stick to the small plates. Our waiter was pushing a steak on us hard, to the point where we just assumed he was hoping to jack the bill up. He was not. The filet we had was excellent. And it comes with four dipping sauces, which we’re always down with. Split one for the table."

We didn't totally rip BLT Fish in our initial review, but it's definitely an extremely underwhelming and overpriced restaurant. We had remembered liking their less expensive, laid back Fish Shack more, but a recent trip has changed our minds. It's a shame too, because that menu is right up our alley - fried fish sandwiches, oysters and beers are a few of our favorite things. But I had a feeling there could be a problem after reaching out to my buddy who lives across the street to find out his favorite thing to get here. His response was, ""food poisoning."" Oh boy.
Now that's obviously more humor than anything else, but I have to say, that lobster roll made us sick to our stomach. I like to consider myself a connoisseur of such delicacies, and BLT Fish Shack's roll is one of the worst I've ever had. It came out looking like chunky lobster chowder on a bun, with aggressive and peculiar seasonings. All that and it's $26. This thing wins the distinguished award of bring the only lobster roll to ever survive a date with this guy. At the end of the meal, all that remained was half a lobster roll, left on the plate, passed over by an entire table of seafood lovers. That's a sad situation.
We're being a little harsh here, and the reality is that BLT Fish Shack on the whole isn't THAT bad, but it should be better. The majority of the raw bar and appetizers will get the job done, but we just can't stop thinking about that awful lobster roll. After another sour experience with their fish establishments, we've decided that the BLT crew might just want to stick with steak.
Oysters/Raw Bar
BLT Fish Shack has one of the biggest and most complete raw bars in all of Manhattan. In the mood for crab? Choose from Jonah, Alaskan King or Dungeness. Clams? You can have either Littleneck or Topneck. There are also periwinkles, whelks and pretty much anything else from the sea that tastes good on ice. We've certainly had some nice crab and lobster selections in the past, but overall the quality and presentation could be better. Our most recent sampling of oysters, a combination of Kumamoto, Wellfleet and Spinney Creek, tasted fine but looked a little strange, like they were matted down in the shells and weren't sucked very well.Tuna Vegetable Tartare
A nice sized helping of raw tuna with an assortment of vegetables, but this pales in comparison to the tuna tartare dishes we've become accustomed to at BLT Prime and BLT Steak.Steamed Mussels with Fries
These are the best thing on the Fish Shack menu, hands down. We're freaks about mussels around here and give these our seal of approval. These come served in a white wine sauce with onion and other goodness. It could use a little more garlic, but on this menu, we're not complaining.Crispy Fish Tacos
A nice helping of fish tacos in soft tortillas, but nothing worth coming for. We're not sure what exactly is crispy about these as they're a bit of a sloppy mess, and the fried fish is smothered in some kind of green spicy sauce that isn't good.Lobster Roll
Epic fail. Read above. It's so embarrassing that I even mis-tweeted its photo (meant to tweet the crispy fish tacos, but this slop was dying to show its face). At least they were playing a good tune.BLT Tuna Sandwich
The table next to ours was eating this and it looked like a slam dunk. Wrong. Hard boiled egg slices on a seared tuna sandwich? No thanks. We had a couple bites of this and that was enough. We did, however, eat every french fry that came with this. Fish Shack does do some damn good fries."

",1.0,Mexican,Tacombi @ Fonda Nolita,7.6,"Tacombi is the name for the converted VW bus that serves the tacos. Fonda Nolita is the name for the space (we think). Put the two together and you have an interesting interpretation of what street food looks like on a really expensive street.
We don't usually pay much attention to online chatter, but even before Señor Tacombi, who previously served tacos from this bus in Playa del Carmen, and Food Network regular Aarón Sanchez officially opened their restaurant to the public, people were talking smack on the internet. Why? Apparently there are other places (California) where tacos are better and cheaper. Also, it seems that giving four dollars to one guy and then having to get your taco from an entirely different guy is too much for some people to handle.
So here is a disclaimer that you should pay attention to. If you a) typically go to Sunset Park for your Mexican food, or b) have a difficult time following simple payment instructions, you are probably not going to be a fan of this place. We'll admit that we were initially unsure about it ourselves. But the more we go back, the more we like Tacombi. Best tacos ever? Definitely not, though the barbacoa and breakfast tacos are pretty excellent. The Mexican courtyard atmosphere is also awesome, and Tacombi gets serious points for creativity and having the balls to try the concept. All in all, we back the place, especially now that they have a liquor license. This place was made for warm weather eats and drinks."

Between the new Gansevoort Hotel, TGI Friday's, and this place, we're going to need something catchy for all the d-bags to put on their Facebook invites. ""Jamie, Sara, Erin, Heather, Jessica, Katie, and Kelli's Birthday Shindig in SoPa! 9:00pm-4:00am. 6 attending, 821 awaiting reply.""
As you can see - we're not happy about some of the things popping up in this 'hood. But it's not entirely fair of us to lump Barbounia into the recent terribleification of this fine stretch of city. The restaurant has been in this location for a few years now, before the chains and the clubby hotel showed up. It is, however, a perfectly relevant reference to the trend. Barbounia is a great example of a restaurant built for a certain kind of person. The kind of person that wants a giant sparkler in their birthday dessert.
We'll admit that the food at Barbounia can be pretty good at times. They do nice things with fish in their big wood-burning oven, and the fresh bread coming out of that thing is pretty tasty as well. But this is definitely not a place we can get behind. It's way too expensive for what they're serving, and the grandiose and gaudy decor makes it feel like some sort of vaguely Mediterranean performance hall. Like at any moment one of the bus boys might start juggling. Not exactly our ideal environment for dinner. Regardless, those who are drawn in by the flashy new stuff on Park will probably like Barbounia quite a bit. They even have a bottomless champagne brunch. See you there never.
Classic Greek Salad
Pretty standard in terms of Greek salad components (cucumber, olives, feta, etc.), but they throw in some za'atar for some kick. A decent option if you want to start with some greens.Charred Octopus
Anything that is either grilled or cooked in the wood burning oven will be decent at Barbounia, and this octopus is no exception. This is tender and pretty tasty. We also liked the fennel salad on the plate.Seared Bluefin Tuna
Not the best option if you're looking for some fish. This isn't bad by any means, but the white fish is where you want to be looking on this menu.Mediterranean Branzino
One of said white fishes, this is available whole or as a filet. It's flaky and pretty delicious, though the lemon potatoes and broccoli rabe on the plate are a bit of a snooze fest.Colorado Lamb Kebab

",4.0,American,Dylan Prime,7.3,"We did some cleansing recently, and while that definitely felt good, it hasn't changed the fact that we still thoroughly enjoy being reckless carnivores that sometimes wake up in the middle of the night with the meat sweats. At the conclusion of our One Lucky Duck raw/vegan cleanse a month ago, we were ravenously craving a steak. Rewarding ourselves for staying the course, we took a trip down to Tribeca to fulfill our needs.
My family has been coming to Dylan Prime for years, and although it's definitely not the best steakhouse in NYC, there's something about it that's always resonated with me. It's got a cooler, more laid back vibe than most steakhouses, and, compared to Midtown, a better location as well. Prime's main dining room still attracts the usual steakhouse crowd (large groups of Suits), but it balances out with a healthy dose of local flavor. Looking for a more sophisticated spot to watch Sports on TV? The Dylan Prime pub room offers up comfortable seating, an expansive bar and a menu of steaks and burgers.
Our favorite part about Dylan Prime? They aren't elitist about their meat. They actually encourage diners to smother their steaks in up to four delicious toppings that range from mushroom & truffle to bacon & cheddar. They also have the balls to stuff a filet mignon with oysters. That alone is worth a few points in our book.
Pork Belly Tater Tots
We weren't really sure how this was going to turn out, but there was no chance we would skip something called ""pork belly tater tots"". They turned out to be a little underwhelming, but are definitely still worth ordering just for the fun of it.Poached Pear Salad
If you're going to roll with a salad as an app, this is the one to go with. Poached Bosc pears, frisée, watercress, candied pistachios and goat cheese. Tasty.Steaks
Rock solid steaks. That's what you get at Dylan Prime. Will these cuts of meat blow your mind? Probably not, but that doesn't mean you're aren't in for a meat-eating treat. The fourteen-ounce Rib Eye is our go-to. Load that baby up with Dylan's foie gras butter and green market hot pepper sauce and get to it. We're also big fans of the eleven-ounce Filet and twelve or sixteen-ounce New York Strip. Whatever you order, don't be afraid to go a little crazy with the toppings and the sauces. That's the whole Dylan Prime experience.Carpetbagger Steak
An eleven-ounce filet mignon stuffed with Blue Point oysters and served with baby spinach, mashed potatoes, Guinness and brown sugar sauce. Is it weird that once you've dug out the oysters, the rest of your steak kind of smells like the ocean for the rest of the meal? Nope, it's actually kind of awesome.Sides
Don't sleep on the sides, Dylan Prime does it up right. The baby baked potatoes with roasted garlic are creamy and delicious. The grilled asparagus is excellent, as is the creamed spinach with bacon."

That's an offer we don't refuse.
We were promptly dispatched to K-Town to hit up Jenny's favorite Korean restaurant in Manhattan, Kunjip. Excellent stews, soups, and pancakes is what we were told to expect, and guess what? Jenny was not wrong.
Everything at Kunjip is highly delicious, and you can eat like a king for a very reasonable price. One thing you should know - you don't come to Kunjip for the wonderful service, you come to get down on some real Korean eats, and fast. Kunjip is a well oiled machine, and it's no secret that they're rushing you through your meal to get the next table of panting onlookers seated. Your first round of food will hit the table within a few seconds of ordering, and the check will be delivered upon first hint of slowing down on your entrees.

It's packed to the gills all day, everyday. It's a joint where suits, business folk, tourists, and Upper East Siders can all dine in harmony. On our most recent visit, a rainy Tuesday night, there wasn't an empty seat to be had - we had to wait a half hour just for a spot at the bar. If we're in the neighborhood, would we rather get down at Quality Meats? Probably, but no one needs to twist our arm to get us in for a trip to BLT Steak, especially if they're paying.
Let's make one thing crystal clear. While BLT Steak is a fine steakhouse, it's no Infatuation approved, 8.6 rated BLT Prime. There's a huge difference. Besides the location, vibe, and overall quality of experience, BLT Prime uses only dry aged beef. BLT Steak does not. While both use USDA Prime or Certified Angus beef, you can taste the difference when it comes to dry aging. It's that much better. Thankfully, they both serve the same exact popover. Table bread in its single greatest form. Details below.
Chopped Vegetable Salad
Fact. BLT has excellent steaks, but they also have damn good salads and the chopped veggie salad is a personal favorite. Don't sleep on the salad and popover power lunch move. That's a solid meal.Bibb Lettuce Salad

Sushi of Gari's flagship location and headquarters on 78th Street is a small space. Good luck scoring a table during prime time. A seat at the bar is actually a better option - that way you can get one on one interaction with the Japanese Chuck Bass lookalike sushi chef. Seriously - we wouldn't mention if it wasn't so disturbingly uncanny. Name dropping Gossip Girl characters is not something we're proud of. At any rate, Japanese Chuck Bass is a talented guy, and just like everyone else that works at Gari, he's super friendly. Not only is the sushi incredible, but the service here is amazing as well.
We have a rather eccentric friend who's not only obsessed with Gari's sushi, but has quite an affinity for their toilet. Because I'm beyond uncomfortable writing about a bidet, I'm going to pull a direct quote from an email she sent me last week after returning from a meal at Gari in which she strategically planned out four trips to the bathroom. ""Can I please tell you how amazing the toilet at Sushi of Gari on 78th street is? It's AAAAAMAZING. It's a TOTO model that has full bidet options for men and women with front and rear cleaning as well as different settings for pulsating or oscillating streams. The seat is heated and has arm rests with other control settings that I don’t even understand. I purposely drink a lot the day I know I am going to Gari and don’t pee before I leave to go there so I can optimize the amount of times I can use the toilet while I am there. I know, I'm crazy.

We spent the better part of this summer pacing back and forth in front of Bill's papered windows, anxious to see what they had in store for our miserably corporate slice of Midtown.

""The days of deciding between Smith and Wollensky's, a place with a mechanical bull, and Ted Turner's desperate attempt to feed us buffalo are soon to be over.""
Now that the doors are open, here's what we have to report back: Not all that much is going to change. Bill's Burgers are still great, and we're still big fans. Some of the new menu items (see, corn dogs) are impressive and this place will kill it. But 10,000 square feet gives the restaurant the vibe of something in between a TGI Friday's and Costco. We couldn't help but feel disappointed that our wish for a little bit of downtown near the office turned out to be just another chain, complete with it's own ""cupcake program"".

",2.0,American,Hill Country Chicken,5.8,"Hill Country Chicken is late to the fried chicken game. Blue Ribbon started the movement, followed soon after by Pies 'n' Thighs, Momofuku, The Redhead and The Commodore. Suddenly burgers were ""so two years ago"" and chicken became the new ""it"" food. Dave Chapelle, wherever he is, would be proud.
Under normal circumstances, we'd probably wait for a restaurant to be open for more than two weeks to weigh in, but we figured we'd be polite and help this new chicken counter work out its kinks. First, and most importantly, let's talk chicken. Hill Country is average at best. It's missing that extra special something that makes mouthwatering fried chicken all kinds of chronic. Additionally, they need to upgrade to actual plates and real silverware. Red baskets might be cute, but they're impossible to cut chicken in, especially when you're using a wimpy plastic fork and knife. Better hot sauce options and maybe a homemade BBQ sauce wouldn't be a bad idea, nor would putting said sauces on each table instead of in the communal area near the soda. Maybe we're spoiled, but we dig our fried chicken cooked to order, piping hot, and plucked right out the fryer rather than sitting under a heat lamp.
One last thing - fried chicken is supposed to be comfort food, right? There's nothing comfortable about waiting in line with a bunch of people and then dog fighting for a table. Honestly, we're not trying to hate - we really wanted this place to be awesome. But, with so many incredible fried chicken options around these days, this isn't one to go out of your way for.
Mama Els Chicken
Personally, I liked this recipe a bit more, as it tasted like the chicken was coated in brown sugar. Still, there was just something missing. It wasn't crispy enough on the outside or juicy enough on the inside to make you want to keep eating it. After a small piece or two, I'd had enough.Biscuits
I like my biscuits buttery and soft and these were heavy and dry. Not good.Texas Hand Roll
There's been a lot of fuss about this, and it's clearly the best thing on the menu. Still, it's not much better than the fried chicken wrap you can get at your local Chopt. The goodness of the chicken and fried avocado (ask for it with both) gets masked by the taste of the wrap, which is dry and bland. That being said, if I worked around here, this wrap would be a weekly power lunch move. It's got absolutely nothing on the Pies 'N' Thighs chicken biscuit, which has set the signature chicken sandwich bar pretty high.Sides
One of our favorite things about Hill Country are the sides - they SLAY sides. You can't beat their cucumber salad or corn pudding. Why wouldn't Hill Country Chicken use the same ones? Baffling. Instead, we're stuck with an inedible, slimy corn salad with too much red pepper and average cole slaw. We were pumped for corn pudding. Big disappointment."

What also comes along with this heightened awareness, is that people tend to let me know any time a new Lebanese restaurant pops up in New York City, as was the case when Naya opened in Midtown East.
Here is the deal with Naya - the food is very good. People are friendly, the prices are fairly reasonable, and it’s a good option for a meal on this awful stretch of Second Avenue. But the layout and design of the restaurant is terrible. The space is about ten feet wide and looks like a high-end shower. We found ourselves enjoying the food quite a bit, but strangely uncomfortable at a table for two with bucket seats.

A glowing one star New York Times review has solidified Chef Julian Medina as an up-and-coming star. His empire is expanding fast, thanks to an equal emphasis on both the dishes that come out of the kitchen as well as the cocktails that accompany them. Toloache ain’t cheap, but in an area where dropping dollars on grub is a given, it’s a breath of fresh air when the food is legitimately awesome. Also, another Times Square rarity, the crowd of neighborhood regulars that frequents Toloache heavily outweighs the tourists. It’s not a huge space, but they do a lot with what they’ve got, and there’s plenty of bar seating in case you want to swing by on a whim.

Totto is dedicated to a mastery over the less common chicken based ramen broth, whereas Hide-Chan specializes in “tonkotsu” broth, which means “very excellent pork bone fat water” in Japanese (I’m told). Hide-Chan is also a much more typical Japanese restaurant environment - one you might expect to find in Midtown East. You walk up a flight of stairs into a room that’s sterile and a little too serious, but pleasant nonetheless. Not quite like Totto Ramen’s open kitchen and East Village vibe.

The only people that really seemed to be enjoying themselves was the table of 23 to our left, and they got dropped off in a school bus that has karaoke in it.
Basically, Olio is a new Neapolitan pizza joint in the West Village, opened by someone who is an award winning “Master Piazzolo” and authority on the subject. I’m not sure how you earn the title of Master Piazzolo, but it probably isn’t by serving personal size pies that make you fantasize about the California Pizza Kitchen at LaGuardia. Each pizza we ordered was a mess of rubbery cheese and crust - heavy, sloppy and unappetizing. Speaking of unappetizing, the octopus salad (see below) was probably the worst thing we’ve ever eaten in a restaurant. So why does Olio get a 1.1? Because we weren’t quite ready to strip Tavern On The Green) of the worst rating on the site."

",2.0,Bar Food,Cowgirl Sea-Horse,4.5,"Let me set the scene for you. It’s about 10pm, and my coworkers and I had been drinking for about five hours already. God bless summer Fridays. We had the bad idea of going to Water Taxi Beach for happy hour and are now starving in South Street Seaport with no idea what to do with ourselves. The Seaport is not known for their food, that’s for damn sure. So, instead of leading this wasted crew through a Chinatown maze which would have only led to bad things, I hit Twitter for suggestions, and was told Cowgirl Sea-Horse was our move. Thanks to everyone who chimed in with a suggestion.
A laid back bar/restaurant with tortilla chips, tacos and buckets of beer was exactly what this crew needed at that moment. The food coming out of the kitchen is average at best. Still, for a relatively cheap place with ample space and good drinks, I’m not complaining. For the Seaport, it’s definitely a good option. Put this restaurant anywhere else though, and we’d keep on walking. Would I take a trip back to the seaport just to hit the Seahorse? Absolutely not. Under similar circumstances though, I’d make the same call. Thank you Twitter."

But if you are female and planning to gather with other females for dinner, we’re betting Morandi got mentioned more than a few times in the two days worth of emails that it took to plan your meal.
Maybe it’s the location, maybe it’s the rustic interior, or maybe because it’s a Keith McNally restaurant, but for whatever reason, Morandi is a big time destination for Girls’ Night Out. We happen to like the place as well, especially for the amazing porterhouse for two, but you have to know what you’re getting into. The restaurant is always loud and packed, especially as the week goes on. Morandi also does an excellent brunch, which can’t be a coincidence. Maybe McNally has just figured out the secret that every college town bar owner has known for ages. Figure out a way to get the girls to come, and everyone else will follow suit."

They're generally more ""adult,"" sophisticated, and seemingly unconcerned with being cool and mixing it up at the Momofukus and Freemans of the world. They're not sleazy old timers trying to make up for lost time, taking European models who wouldn't talk to them before they got rich out to Keith McNally joints. And although they can most likely afford it, they're not regularly pissing away money at pricey five star restaurants. These are every day New Yorkers who certainly care about where they eat, they just don't necessarily need to be Scoping Hot Girls/Guys anymore and can do without all the crazy action that usually coincides with trendy Manhattan dining. They go to The Red Cat because it's a quality local spot with just enough flavor that they can rely on for a consistently good meal and a glass or two of wine. While it is indeed an older crowd, it's not a stuffy one. We happily keep this place in rotation after any Madison Square Garden event, and is always a hit on a Dinner with the Parents excursion. If you're folks are anything like mine, they'll dig.
Yellowfin and Yellowtail
A double shot of yellowfin tuna and yellowtail, served two ways. Real tasty.Baked Fontina
Perfect as an appetizer or something to munch on at the bar, this is not your ordinary cheese dip. Layers of fontina, sliced fresh garlic and thyme are broiled to perfection in a cast iron skilled and served with chunks of rustic bread. Amazing.Grilled Buttermilk Pork Chop
I haven't had this in a couple of years, but have fond memories of this bad boy always hitting the spot. Any combo of buttermilk, pork chop and white wine bacon butter is a recipe for success.Calves Liver Au Poivre
Personally, I don't get down with livers, but being that The Red Cat is a favorite of my liver lovin' Dad, I've got the inside scoop on this action. The fact that he orders this pretty much every time we come here is a telling sign that this calves liver au poivre with bacon swiss chard pie and melted tomato is the real deal.Blackboard Pork Special

Well first of all, there aren't many that serve good food, and it's rare that we're heading out to drink without some serious eating on the agenda as well. Second, wine bar crowds are usually a room full of awkward first dates, and that girl who turns bright red after two glasses and spends an hour telling her friend and everyone else within thirty feet how ugly Becky's bridesmaid dresses were. Inside voices please.
So it's not often that a wine bar comes with an enthusiastic Infatuation Approval, but Terroir's new outpost in Tribeca most certainly does. Yes, we love it because the food is awesome, but we also love it because owners Paul Grieco and Marco Canora clearly don't take themselves too seriously. These guys are enjoying themselves, and so are the people that come to their establishments. We found no sign of the typical wine bar crowd, but rather a full house of happy people tearing into some food and drinking (a lot). That's more our speed. The menu has all the snacks and charcuterie that you might expect to find, but there are also some gems like the meatball sandwich and pretty much anything with the word ""balls"" in it.

",1.0,Burgers,Shake Shack Times Square,7.7,"""Selling out"" will always be a hotly debated topic. Growing up, my friends and I would spend hours arguing about whether or not our favorite bands were sellouts. Green Day, Rancid, Bad Religion, all bands that were supposed to be so punk, yet signed on with a major label at one point in their careers. Were they sellouts? To a 16 year old, absolutely. But looking back, can you really blame them for trying to make some money? After all, music is a business just like everything else. Is LeBron James a sellout? Hell yes. Sure, he took less money to play in Miami, but LeBron's selling out doesn't have to do with the green stuff. Not only did he sell out the city of Cleveland, he sold out his own legacy and all the fans he fooled into believing he had the make up and desire to be one of the greatest players of all time and lead his own team to a championship.
Now on to restaurants. Is Danny Meyer a sellout for popping out Shake Shacks faster than The Duggars pop out Mormon children? Nope, he's just an opportunistic businessman, flippin' burgers in a silly hat, Reel Big Fish style. Shacks are multiplying at record speed, across NYC and beyond. Meyer just opened a Miami Beach Shake Shack, and has plans for Washington DC, Saratoga Springs, Boston, and Dubai. We're happy to report that this increase in quantity has had no ill effects on the quality. In fact, the Double Shack Burger I recently took down at the Times Square location was hands down the best Shack Burger I've ever had in my life.
Be aware going in, Shake Shack Times Square is quite the tourist attraction. As you might expect, that means insane lines, loud music and all kinds humans everywhere. But at least now all those tourists who fail to make it out of Times Square on their trip can actually get one small taste of what this city is all about."

Mile End is a Jewish delicatessen in Boerum Hill named for and modeled after the gentrified Montreal neighborhood by the same name, which has a strong Jewish population and apparently some killer Jewish food.
Here in Brooklyn, this place has become the topic of often-heated discourse and debate. As you can imagine, when it comes to a Jewish deli in this city, there is no shortage of opinions. Some say Mile End is too hipster, some say it's too expensive, some say it's too crowded, and yet at the same time many say it's the greatest place ever. We've heard it all.
Here's what I can tell you: I don't care what anyone says, this is great food. Everything at Mile End is made with top notch ingredients and is meticulously prepared. The staff behind the small kitchen counter care about every plate that goes out the door, so regardless of whether it's the kind of bagel you're used to or not, someone put a lot of effort into making it awesome. From our perspective, If you like smoked meats and things with ""hash"" in the name, this is a place you need to visit. We don't want to hear any complaining about waiting for a table, or hipsters, or how you can get a pastrami sandwich for four dollars on the Upper West Side.

The Rusty Knot is not a place for normal dinner time. This is a bar, and a dirty one at that. A kitschy nautical theme and devastating drinks make up the DNA of this place, and it just so happens that they serve amazing bar food that will save your life at 1:00am. Not that the killer food was an accident -Ken Friedman (The Spotted Pig, The Breslin, music biz) is a partner, and he seems to have a pretty good handle on what makes hungry drunk people happy. Our visits to the Rusty Knot usually follow the same pattern: night out at restaurant turns into extra drinks, extra drinks happen at the Spotted Pig, Spotted Pig makes us hungry for some food and more action...and then we're sitting on the floor at Rusty Knot eating pretzel dogs and tacos.

Suddenly the Happy Taco opens on your block and the same dude that delivered General Tso’s to your neighbor three nights a week is slinging enchiladas? Well then you don’t get out enough. What does that have to do with Aurora? Nothing really, I’m just craving Kung Pao enchiladas.
Actually, I bring that up because Aurora is an excellent Williamsburg Italian restaurant that’s apparently run by fiery Latin people. And we’re not talking about some kind of fusion thing here. This is real deal Italian food, down to the hand made pasta and fresh burrata. Other than the friendly Latin staff, the occasional salsa music on the playlist, and the watermelon sangria, you would think Aurora was a Williamsburg cousin of Supper. And as you would expect from a place reminiscent of those East Village favorites, Aurora’s solid food and charm make it a great First/Early in the Game Date spot. The noticeable lack of hipsters also makes it a good option for Dinner with the Parents, just swing them by the ATM first - it’s cash only. But the real notable feature at Aurora is the garden. A huge, partially covered, and well-greened patio make this one of Williamsburg’s best Outdoor/Patio Situations. On prime days, just make sure to reserve ahead of time if you want a table outside, or be prepared you to face a sultry yet slightly annoyed hostess that looks kind of like Penelope Cruz. So yeah, on second thought...walk-ins recommended."

",2.0,American,Walker’s,7.3,"In a Manhattan neighborhood that’s undergone a modern facelift over the last twenty years, it’s good to know not everything has changed. With the exception of a couple of new flat screens, Walker’s is pretty much exactly the same as your Pops left it back in the day when this tavern was the place to be on a Saturday night. Walker’s is a Tribeca landmark - a prime example of a Classic NYC Establishment, and a low key spot that attracts an older crowd who enjoy a good burger and some Sports on TV. Rich with history and solid beers on tap, Walker’s serves up above average pub fare and makes up for things being a bit overpriced with large serving sizes. If we’re in the mood for a burger in Tribeca, we go to Walker’s without hesitation.
Burger
This big, fat, juicy eight ounce sirloin burger isn’t the greatest burger in history, but it gets the job done right. It’s a classic tavern burger, a few steps above what you would find in a good diner, and a couple of steps below a joint that specializes in burgers. The fries are average.
Roasted Organic Chicken
This right here is a Walker’s go-to. A huge plate of chicken that’s got a specific salty, garlicky flavor to it. It’s probably been the same recipe for forty years. Served with a mountain of mashed potatoes and some greens, for fifteen bucks, you really can’t go wrong.
Steak Sandwich
In theory, this should be really freakin’ good - shell steak on nice thick bun with caramelized onions, fries, and greens. But it’s one of those steak sandwiches thats hard to bite into because it’s just one big slab of steak in between the bread. There are some people who like this style of steak sandwich, but not me. Definitely go burger or salad over this.
Tuna Nicoise Salad
I always feel that restaurants get a little too cute with Nicoise salads. Yes, it’s nice to have an egg and green beans in the salad, but we still need some roughage to get down on too. Walker’s doesn’t get too crazy on the crazy veggies and you wind up with a good balance and sizable chunk of grilled yellowfin tuna. When I worked in Tribeca, I used to get this for lunch all the time and always left satisfied and full."

They'll call us the ""Fast Food Bandits"" and we'll take down a few Burger Kings just to make sure the name sticks.
We've talked about the three tiers of sushi restaurants in New York, and this is most definitely a Tier One sushi establishment. It's upscale, it's expensive, and it's good enough for me to consider earning a criminal record for. Why is it worth all that? Well to start, the fish is incredibly good. Everything is fresh and authentic, and will make you realize why people freak out over things like fresh uni and toro. It's also a pleasant environment for a meal - a good option for a date or a business meeting...which can't be said for many of the other elite sushi restaurants in town. Here's the thing though - if you are dining for either of those reasons, make sure you go with people that want to get down on a serious sushi experience. If you're bringing someone that's going to ask for the spicy mayo, skip 15 East and go somewhere cheaper. That ain't this how this place gets down, and you shouldn't drop a car payment on somebody who would be just as happy with a mango tempura jalapeño red dragon roll."

Not only is this a dope BBQ spot, it's the perfect destination for a night (or day) out with a Big Group for some quality grub and booze. Situated inside what used to be an old auto body shop, this gutted garage is raging every night of the week. It's essentially a combination of a Brooklyn beer garden and Texas style BBQ.

First of all, we’ve been watching a lot of Mad Men, and P.J. Clarke’s is one of the few places in town that still feels like a relic from that era. If you want to get your Roger Sterling on, there is hardly a better place to do it. Show producers even wrote the restaurant into an episode as the setting for a scene in Season 1.
Second, we recently read an article in another publication stating that only recently has New York become a good burger town, now that Pat LaFrieda owns the city and Shake Shack has adopted Chipotle’s expansion plan. We’d like to disagree. P.J. Clarke’s has been rocking a good burger for decades, as have some other NYC classics like [Old Town (http://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/old-town-bar) and J.G. Melon. Let’s give the elders some credit.
The only thing we don’t like about P.J. Clarke’s is that it’s almost always insufferably busy. Most of the time the after work crowd is so big that it spills out onto the streets, and the tourist traffic on weekends can make it tough to get a seat."

I quickly realized that what I held in my hand was a perfectly assembled fistful of cured meat, cheese and bread that would be the start of a long and fulfilling relationship with Lamazou. From that day forward, this place was a three day a week meal stop, and over the years I managed to eat my way through damn near everything in the deli case.
What you'll find at Lamazou is not only an incredible selection of cheeses (there is a cheese cave in the basement), but also various high quality cured meats. Both selections are incredible in their own right, but the real magic comes when the two are combined to make bomb ass sandwiches. Aziz is always happy to recommend something from the menu, and he'll also point you in the direction of what goodness in the cheese case is particularly off the hook...whether you ask or not. That's exactly the kind of personality and passion that makes this place amazing.

I suppose you could bring in a full size bottle of shampoo if you want.
At Le Relais de Venise, there is only one thing on the menu. It's a three course meal that costs $24 and consists of the following: salad, steak, and frites. Loyalists maintain that this is a fantastic deal for a really good steak - and waitresses in French maid outfits seem to always get a mention. In reality, this is mediocre steak smothered in ""secret"" sauce to compensate for the fact that it's tough and chewy. Kind of like what McDonald's does with the McRib.

Now that we’ve been to Blind Tiger, we will retract that last part. I grew up in Colorado, and went to college in Fort Collins, which is place that several very successful breweries call home. Needless to say, I became accustomed to drinking in bars with incredible beer selections. What I also became accustomed to, was eating some kind of terrible chicken ranch sandwich for dinner in these places, because that’s what you get in Fort Collins (ranch dressing is a religion in this part of the country). What we have found at Blind Tiger is a New York City bar that actually has an extensive microwbrew selection AND excellent food. Unfortunately, we’re not the only ones that know it. The place gets very crowded at times, but weekend afternoons are perfect, as are late nights when you need a good beer and a grilled cheese. The wings and sandwiches are also excellent, and it’s a great place to mix it up and meet people. Be warned though - the bar staff know their beer, but they’re not very friendly.

We went again this year, only to find that a new Accademia Di Vino has taken over the space. Who gave that joint the go-ahead to breed?
Instead of ripping apart another Accademia establishment, I figured we'd drop a little arial font on Docks' lone surviving East Side establishment and the site of the Betty White/Jay-Z SNL after-party we went to a couple of weeks ago. Out of respect to family tradition and my Grandmother, who used to frequent the UWS Docks, I won't rip it apart. I'll also refrain from objectifying the rear end in this review, something Grandma tells me I do too much.
Docks is the furthest thing from a hip, happening restaurant. It's packed with old people and the after work crowd. It serves a purpose for the average Grand Central commuter who isn't baller enough to get into Cipriani, but still wants to spend big money on mediocre food. When dinner at The Cheesecake Factory is the norm, I guess Docks looks pretty good. If you find yourself in the area and hungry for a quick beer and some raw bar action, stick to the basics (oysters, clam chowder, grilled tuna) and you'll be fine. Just don't get ambitious and start pissing money away on steaks. We could think of a few better ways to drop forty bucks.
Fried Calamari
Completely Inedible. Resist the temptation.New England Clam Chowder
Docks has a very good clam chowder with a nice thick broth that's loaded with clams. Definitely order this.Sesame Crusted Yellowfin Tuna
A safe bet, which is the road we suggest taking. I've eaten this here plenty, and have never been overly impressed or overly disappointed. Generally, all the grilled fish options are solid, but unspectacular.Lobster
Jane claims this is the greatest lobster ever. Then again, she says this about every lobster she eats, so that doesn't give you much to go on. On our last visit, the chilled lobster was spot on...fresh, rich and delicious. Check out the twit pic .Organic Scottish Salmon
Served with a Moroccan chickpea puree and crisp fennel salad, this salmon tastes exactly how you'd expect it to taste. Like salmon. Simple and generic. Next.Seafood Cobb Salad

Baked clams in miso butter. These are amazing, but you'll wish that there were more than four on the plate, and you'll wish they weren't four bucks each.Smoked Pork Belly Kushi Yaki
Like the fried rice, this is a good sized serving (rare for this place), and is another must order. Basically a pot of pulled pork served with rice and hot sauce. Get it.Fried Chicken ""Blue Ribbon Style""
Very similar to the signature Blue Ribbon Brasserie version, but with wasabi added to the honey. The chicken is perfect, and the honey has a strong wasabi kick that makes it even better. This is outrageously good."

",3.0,American,Cask Bar + Kitchen,4.0,"Insert joke at the expense of Murray Hill...here. It's so easy to tee up on a restaurant in this neighborhood that we almost feel bad doing it. That is until we see people all over the internet calling Cask Bar + Kitchen an ""oasis"" in the Murray Hill food desert. Allow us to set the record straight. There are all of three places you should be eating in this vicinity: Penelope, 2nd Avenue Deli, and Lamazou. A meal at Cask is hardly any different that what you'll find at Vertigo, Tonic East, or any of the other area bars that serve food for the sole purpose of sobering up the idiots. Philly cheese steak spring rolls should pretty much tell the story.
If however, you are just in the 'hood looking for a drink, Cask will do just fine. They have a good selection of beers, and are probably the only bar within three blocks that doesn't have a weekly Jagermeister promotion. The downstairs Cellar Bar is also a great option for a birthday or a private party...we would just recommend setting up a dinner somewhere else first.
Kobe Sliders
Perfectly fine sliders with a red onion marmalade. Three come to an order, and they'll do the job of soaking up some booze, especially since they're a little dry.Bruschetta Flatbread
The flatbreads are a safe choice on the Cask menu, but don't expect to be blown away. The bruschetta flat bread can be ordered hot or cold, and hot is definitely the way to go...we think. Either way, it's a pizza."

",3.0,American,Death & Co,7.8,"You know how it feels like some establishments were built precisely for you? That's how we feel about Death & Co. Any place that makes room on their menu to quote Hunter S. Thompson - ""I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity, but they've always worked for me."" - is on our wavelength. It's no secret that we like to booze. When it comes to fancy cocktails, Death & Co is one of our favorites. The drink list is ridiculous...it's nearly impossible to settle on something because each beverage is intriguing and awesome. Some of our favorites are the Cure For Pain (rye whiskey, vermouth, bourbon, and more goodness) and the seriously tasty Rita Hayworth (pineapple and sage-infused siembra tequila, lime juice, and acacia honey syrup). Damn is she fine.
It wasn't until recently that we figured out D&C was more than just a place to grab a libation or two. You can actually have an excellent meal as well. Think of it as a tapas joint that resembles a wedding cocktail hour: American classics that go quite well with a drink shaken or stirred. The kitchen paces itself well, so dishes come out one at a time, and they give you a chance to enjoy your drink as well as the food. After a long day, a Robert Johnson Swizzle (single barrel bourbon, lime juice, 10yr port, vanilla syrup and more) with a side of truffle mac n cheese is exactly what the doctor ordered.
Seared Petite Filet Mignon
A pleasantly surprising ditty of a steak. The meat has a great seared crust on it, and for sixteen dollars, we aren't complaining. This is really good, and could easily fill up one not-so-starving person.Lobster Brioche Rolls
Three lobster sliders served on toasted brioche rolls. These bad boys were a great compliment to the Grass Kilt (coconut green tea-infused grouse scotch, lemon juice, pineapple juice, acacia honey syrup, cinnamon syrup) I was sipping when they rolled out of the kitchen. Now, this isn't the purist Luke's Lobster approach - this is more of a chicken salad type of lobster salad as the lobster bits are mixed in equal parts with crunchy jicama, apple, and fennel slaw. They're little mini lobster sandwiches, and they're good.Wild Mushroom Tart
Sautéed mushrooms with caramelized onion pesto and walnuts on top of a pastry tart. Surprisingly tasty, and definitely a good drinking snack."

This review is specifically for the cafe, La Esquina’s urban surf shack - and the taqueria, a prime outdoor seating option. La Esquina may not be the most authentic Mexican in town, but it is one of the few establishments to properly spin everything we love about NYC restaurants - attention to detail, high quality ingredients, and smart flavor combinations - into a taco. Sure, two fish tacos at the cafe cost twelve bucks, but they’re also really good.Easily one of my favorite things to order here is the Ceviche Estilo Acapuloc. This is a fresh fish ceviche (usually red snapper) that’s served in the same glass bowl you used to get Friendly’s ice cream sundaes in. Fresh lime, avocado, tomatoes and jalapenos give this starter a nice kick. A must order.The La Esquina Mole Negro is a half chicken drenched in a sweet and savory mole sauce sauce that makes a strong case for best mole in NYC. It’s perfectly balanced - not too heavy or too sweet - and it really brings the chicken to life. We like the chicken mole enchiladas too.The fish tacos are definitely not our favorite fish taco. That said, on any given day, these can be a little better (or a little worse) than what you’ll find at most places. The fish shows up skewered in a soft taco with pickled red onions and shaved cabbage. It’s the red onions that get me every time. Pretty damn tastyThe crispy pork tacos are absolutely ridiculous. I daydream about them often and pretty much only order this and fish tacos every time I visit...which is why this food rundown isn’t longer.If you like your tortilla soups thick, skip their tortilla soup. The broth is super thin, but it has great flavor and a nice serving of avocado.We love taquitos. The oxtail ones are skinny, crispy guys are a nice way to start off your meal, and for eight dollars, you can’t go wrong.The taqueria makes solo tacos in the three to four dollar range, most of which land somewhere between good and excellent. Our favorites are the chorizo and the sausage with potatoes and cactus. The seasonal mushroom tacos are also really good."

",3.0,Portuguese,Aldea,5.7,"After being hyped on this place by friends and food media for the last year, I was pretty confident Aldea was going to be a John Starks over the entire Bulls team kind of slam dunk. Not the case. While some of their highly touted dishes - namely the sea urchin toast and duck paella - were certainly quite good, the rest of the food wasn't nearly as impressive. Some of it even had to be sent back, and we rarely ever play that game.
Aldea pimps out their chef, George Mendes, New Orleans style. In NOLA, chef photos and accolades greet you at the front door and decorate restaurant walls, watching you eat. By the time your meal is finished, you know damn well that John Besh or Donald Link is the man that made it all possible. Aldea revolves its world around Mendes in a similar way. Our waiter must have dropped George's name three or four times, and I guarantee he's required to do that. It all feels a little desperate...if your food is that good, New Yorkers will recognize. No need to shove it in our faces. Despite all the name dropping, Aldea is a very comfortable eating environment. We lucked out and got the best seat in the house, the back booth right in front of the kitchen, which you should absolutely request when you're making a reservation. Overall, we're not saying Aldea is a bad restaurant, it just doesn't live up to all the hype. We'll go back sometime, we're just not in any rush.
Sea Urchin Toast
Ok. This was good. Really good. But it's also incredibly rich. Sea urchin sits on top of a thin toasted cracker-thing with cauliflower cream and sea lettuce. Pretty great.Salt Cod Croquettas
Possibly the creamiest cod crox we've ever had. I personally enjoyed them, but the rest of the table was not feelin' the ultra-smooth texture of these.Wellfleet Oysters
Six Oysters, seventeen bucks. I mean, come on. That's a bit much, especially when they suck. The oysters were quite disappointing, as was the pickled ramp mignonette. Next.Slow-Poached Egg
This was excellent. A slow poached egg sitting in a light spring garlic broth with truffle, sweet peas and smoked bacon. Break the yolk and mix everything together for the ultimate bite.Tilefish
Holy crap, this was gross. So bad that we actually sent it back to catch a little fire (the fish wasn't cooked at all). It appeared that they plated and garnished the fish right out of the fridge, and this wasn't supposed to be a sushi dish. When it came back cooked, it didn't matter. This fish tasted like it'd been sitting around for weeks and the biggest travesty is that it came highly recommended from our waiter. Stay away from the tilefish.Arroz De Pato
The dish Aldea is famous for, and pretty much the reason that we came. New York Magazine awarded it ""Best Paella"" and the Village Voice named it the Best Duck Dish of 2009. It's definitely really good, but as with this entire restaurant, it just didn't blow us (or the rest our my table), away. A paella of duck confit, chorizo, olive, and duck cracklings, the texture is fantastic, but the flavors are just a tad too overbearing.Pork and Clams
Don't let the name fool you, this really is just a pork belly dish. I thought we'd get a healthy dose of both belly and clams, but that wasn't the case. There were maybe three clams on the plate, seemingly for decoration only. That being said, the thin strips of pork belly were quite savory and the sweet and sour glaze was really tasty."

",4.0,American,Perry St,6.8,"Is it just me, or is it slim-pickins around the Meatpacking District these days? Finding a good scene with reasonably priced, excellent food isn't easy. I was recently having drinks with a big group at The Standard Grill, in need of a dinner destination (we sure as hell weren't eating there). Unfortunately, I didn't really have a game plan in place. It's a stressful spot to be in. An entire crew is relying on you to make the right decision and lead them to the promised land for dinner. After a couple of desperate tweets for help, I made the call, and we landed at Perry St. Was it the right call? For a Saturday night, maybe not (this is definitely more of a weekday spot), but it was the best move we could have made under the circumstances.
Perry St is in the ground floor of some super-modern, all glass building on the West Side Highway. It's a nice place, but it's completely sterile and a little stuffy. It's definitely an older, more proper crowd. Got straight-laced family in town from Greenwich? This is the perfect Dinner with the Parents destination. Neither the maître d' or the tables around us were too thrilled with our quasi-rowdy party, which by Perry St standards might as well have been a table rave. The food was a let down too. After eating a spectacular dinner at ABC Kitchen the week before, I was expecting a more dynamic meal from a Jean Georges restaurant. That being said, we would come back here and order the butter poached lobster anytime. That's one of the single best dishes we've eaten this year, and it saved this review from the toilet. We also hear rumblings that they serve a decent brunch. Maybe we'll come back and check it out, and this time we'll bring grandma. On second thought, no we won't. She's too cool for this place.
Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna
This tuna appetizer is one of Perry St's signature dishes - it was the number one recommendation of our waiter. Sadly, it wasn't that memorable, partially because we only got half the dish. The other half wound up being accidentally dropped into a water glass by our server and not being replaced. Thanks dude. The rice cracker crust is certainly tasty, but it's nothing life changing, and we expected a little more from something that comes served in a sriracha-citrus emulsion.Sweet Chili Crab Dumplings
Another dish that arrived at our table after being highly touted, but just didn't do it for us. There was something missing, and we couldn't understand how this slimy green dumpling could be one of their most popular dishes.Cod With Miso-Yuzu Glaze
Not the best miso cod we've ever had, but the sriracha gives the fish a serious kick of flavor. If you don't like it spicy, take a pass on this one."

",4.0,American,Blue Hill at Stone Barns,9.7,"If you're like us, and/or any New Yorker that spends some of their free time and all of their money at restaurants, then you probably have this magical farm outside of town on your hit list. We most definitely did, and we finally made an Infatuation Field Trip out of the city to check it out. Here's what we can tell you that you don't already know: not much. Blue Hill at Stone Barns is outstanding. But while you might already know the facts, you don't have Infatuation perspective on the place, and that's really all that matters isn't it? Let's discuss.
New York City has developed quite the obsession with local and sustainable food over the last few years. Ramps show up for the first time of the season at The Union Square Greenmarket, and people buzz about it like someone just figured out time travel. Every year. Those kind of people and that kind of culture has to exist for a place like Blue Hill to be truly appreciated. If you still eat more Fruit By The Foot than actual fruit, this might not be the best way for you to spend a few hundred bucks and four hours of your life. But if you're the type of person that desperately wants to meet a pig in person and then eat it, rent a car.
As for the facts, you probably know that chef and owner Dan Barber is a badass. You probably also know that the majority of what you eat at Blue Hill comes from the farm that the restaurant is situated on. This makes for an incredible meal that you leave in the chef's hands, known as the Farmer's Feast. It's a marathon of a dinner (ours lasted well into the next morning and we sat at 9:00), but it will blow your mind. The quality of the ingredients and the creativity in which they are presented is unparalleled, and as good as advertised. What really impressed us though, was the attention to the experience as a whole, and the over-the-top efforts that the staff made to ensure that we learned something. Want to know what was in that incredible brioche thing you just had? Suddenly some dude comes out of nowhere and puts a bowl of grains and an ostrich egg on the table. Curious about that watercress? It just so happens that the poor kid that picked it this morning is putting in a shift at the restaurant just so he can serve it to you. That's dedication to the cause, and it's executed with class on all levels. We highly recommend that you make your own field trip to Stone Barns, and if you want to get the most out of your journey, we suggest going well ahead of your reservation time. Roam the grounds, have a drink on the terrace, maybe help that kid pick some watercress. He looked like he could use it."

You’ll be hard pressed to find a better cure for those extra shots you took last night that made you so awesome at Buckhunter and girls.
There’s plenty of ramen in the East Village these days, and no shortage of opinions on where to go. We happen to believe that Rai Rai Ken sits near the top of the heap, mostly because that shoyu ramen is so good, but also because it’s inexpensive and simple. It’s one of our favorite places for Dining Solo on a Saturday afternoon. We don’t, however, recommend trying to go during prime lunch or dinner hours. The whole restaurant is about fifteen seats, all at a counter, and they’re almost always taken. If you do give it a shot, the good news is that turnover is pretty quick, and you have plenty of other ramen options around the neighborhood as a backup plan."

Nope, they're just serving avocado toast, dusted with pepper flakes.
Cafe Gitane is the epitome of the ""it"" downtown cafe - a quintessential Nolita eatery and place to See And Be Seen that so many places try (and fail) to replicate. The food is actually pretty good. Dinner can be underwhelming, but brunch is solid, and the prices aren't as bad as you might expect. But Cafe Gitane isn't for everyone. The place is tiny, and staring down a bunch of really hot people while you cram your fat ass into a little chair isn't always awesome. You are also pretty much guaranteed to face long waits, but during the summer it's a great warm weather dining destination, and can be worth hanging around for a table on the street or near one of the big windows.

I don't care if you wear pleated wrinkle-free Dockers every day of your life, how does that even make sense for a restaurant dress code? Formal, or jacket required is one thing, but clearly stating that your clientele should be wearing tucked in golf shirts? Classy. Make sure to let us know when Hawaiian shirt Friday happens.
If you haven't figured it out by now, we're not fans of Sparks. Everything about the place feels stuffy and corporate, like eating at the only steakhouse within twenty miles of a major convention center. Despite the business casual rule, most everyone you'll see is dressed in a boxy suit, looking ready to drop some dollars at the nearest strip club after dinner. And on top of all that, the steaks are a let down and the service is terrible. The one thing Sparks does have going for it? A famous mobster was murdered out front. Cool! (says everyone on the red double decker bus). We don't know about you, but we'll skip the gangster back story and eat a steak somewhere that doesn't make us angry.

The steaks are definitely great, and sides like goose fat potatoes and black
truffle creamed spinach make us very happy as they slowly narrow the path of
blood to our heart.
But we also like the place for the simple fact that it's just about the only
steakhouse town that isn't either full of grandpas, dudes wearing holsters for their smart phones, or rude made-for-TV Italian waiters.
Strip House is a vibey downtown bordello of goodness, and is the antithesis to
the things we hate about a place like Sparks or The Palm (AKA upscale
Applebee's). When you're in need of a steak, but want something a little sexier than Luger's, Strip House should be your stop. You might wait a little while, even with a reservation, but it's worth it. This is one of the best steaks in town."

Sure, hipsters are easy targets, and mocking them has become a cliché in its own right, but it’s too hard to resist here. The warm and cozy adirondack cabin thing at Lodge feels forced and contrived. And yes, we get the whole beards and flannel irony of a dude that goes fly fishing in Brooklyn. This place is unfortunately like Freemans' apathetic little brother - trying hard to emulate, but falling short of the effortless cool of their older sibling.
When it comes to good food and service, that hipster ideal of just not giving a sh*t doesn’t fly. Our party of four came in on a slow weekday night and our waitress was disinterested from the start. We don’t ask for much, and all it takes is about thirty seconds of pretending like you actually care for us to feel loved. Come say hello once. Let us know you're at least attempting to do your job. Also, try not to give us terrible recommendations (see the whole grilled trout). Lodge’s menu looked good, and it's pretty damn cheap, but it ultimately fell short on the follow through. We'll pass on the Brooklyn hipster aesthetic and eat somewhere good instead.

If you ask us, a good lamb slider should be like a powerful little hand grenade of Mediterranean flavor, as opposed to these bland improvised non-explosive burger devices. Sorry...we just watched The Hurt Locker.Whole Grilled Trout
What a travesty. Our uninterested waitress swore by this dish, only leading us to further question her competence. The fish was bone dry with giant pieces of undercooked rosemary. Note to all restaurants: if you’re not finely chopping the rosemary, leave it on the sprig and remove after cooking. The rosemary flavor will be there and I won’t have to chew on tree bark with my fish.Pulled Pork
Some great sweet and smoky BBQ flavor going on here, but the presentation was a bit puzzling. The pork was served in a bowl with a little too much liquid goin' on. No bread or anything to scoop up the goodness either. Luckily, this was served with a side of mac & cheese that may have been the best thing we ate at Lodge.Scallop Jambalaya

specializes in one thing. Our rating system is a complex algorythm (developed
during my tenure at MIT), that assigns numeric values to countless variables
like food quality, menu options, service, atmosphere, and the probability that
you will get laid after dinner. It's science.
What we have noticed though, is that a lack of variables consistently produces
the same result...most of the restaurants that specialize in one thing earn
high marks from us. The following evidence supports our hypothesis: Burger
Joint, Luke's
Lobster, Bark
Hot Dogs, Flex
Mussels, and
Caracas.
Another test of this theory brings us to The Meatball Shop, a restaurant on
the Lower East Side operating with the sole purpose of turning out
ridiculously good meatballs and presenting you a few options in which to
consume them. There are meatball sandwiches, meatball sliders, meatballs in
sauce, and meatballs on pasta. Other than a few sides and a nice wine
list...that's it. The result? We love it. A concept that could easily have
been a divey storefront serving late night heroes is instead a wonderfully

You can still roll in on a Friday night and get a seat because everyone else is trying to get a table at one of the other 20 Italian restaurants in a two block radius. What they don’t know is that Il Posto Accanto is home to some of the best meatballs and pastas in town, along with a great wine list and open air dining. We were honestly sort of torn about writing this place up, but you’re a loyal reader and deserve to have it in your repertoire. Just promise you won’t tell New Jersey."

",3.0,American,Home Restaurant,3.2,"Amidst a near hurricane recently, we needed a restaurant in a pinch -something within walking distance from a 30th birthday venue in the West Village. We wound up at Home Restaurant, which turned out to be an unfortunate move. You can't make the right call all the time, and while we don't necessarily enjoy trashing a place, we don't want you making the same mistake we did. This was bland, unimpressive, and expensive eating and what's worse -it's a ""critics' pick"" in NY Mag. We still can't figure what these ""critics"" are basing their ""picks"" on. Luckily, you've got us for that now.
We really wanted to like this place. The vibe reminded us of a West Village version of Infatuation favorite Tree - a cozy neighborhood bistro complete with a little garden in the back. We really did like the space, and it's unfortunate that the food and service incited wrath inside of us. Things actually started off strong. A plate of chocolate chip cookies greets you upon entry, and you know how we feel about our cookies. But, it was all downhill from there. The service is slow and apathetic for no reason, and the food was just downright bad. Now we understand why their main claim to fame is homemade ketchup. With so many good restaurants in that area, we're surprised that Home has managed to stay open for ten years. I guess that's what that ""critic's pick"" buys you.
Black Eyed Pea Chicken Chili
This special appetizer was the saving grace of a bad first round of food and ended up being the best dish we tried all night.Braised Short Ribs
How is it humanly possible to slow cook something for six hours and have it come out tasting like absolutely nothing? This was the most bland, tasteless short rib I’ve ever come into contact with. I can’t believe this is actually served at a restaurant. The only thing that kept us from sending this dish back was the scalloped potatoes accompanying it.Macaroni & Cheese
The main reason we had dinner here is that we were rolling with Infatuation’s resident mac & cheese expert. Home allegedly has an excellent one, and we figured we’d throw him a bone. Sadly, this $18 bowl was nothing special. Our expert ate around all the rubbery hunks of chorizo which would have served the dish better ground up.Molasses Double Cut Pork Chop
Another colossal disaster, this pork chop was terrible. We got through half of it and then gave up all hope of finding any redeeming quality. Much like the short rib, this tasted like absolutely nothing."

",2.0,Bar Food,Wilfie & Nell,7.1,"Wilfie & Nell is a cozy little bar situated right on the edge of that part of the West Village that you might also know as ""the vortex"". We've lived in New York City for almost eight years and even with Google Maps, Hopstop and a few orienteering courses, we still get turned around down here. Luckily, there are plenty of good reasons to find yourself lost in the neighborhood, and this place is one of them.
Seeing as how we're writing about it on this site, you would be right to assume that Wilfie & Nell is a restaurant - they serve not only dinner but now brunch, and the menu was originally curated by Momofuku alumni and Brooklyn Star owner Joaquin Baca. But it is first and foremost a place you come to drink, rather than a place you come to eat. Consider it an added bonus that the bar food you'll likely be eating while standing near a tiny ledge is pretty good. Tables fill up quickly, as do the bar seats, and thirty people can make the place feel crowded thanks to low ceilings and strange layout. Nonetheless, it's a vibey bar that will get you cool points on a date, or maybe even land you one for later in the week. Just try not to spill mustard on your pants while you eat in the corner.
Berkshire Pork Sliders
Shredded pork on a nice fluffy little bun. These can be a little dry, but throw on a pickle and some of the mustard that comes on the side, and they're at the very least serviceable.Grilled Cheese
Far and away the best thing on the menu at Wilfie & Nell, and one of the best grilled cheeses we've eaten. Served on Blue Ribbon Pullman with perfectly gooey cheese and caramelized onions. Excellent.Fries
Really good thick cut fries, served with malt vinegar, which we love."

The few people that have told us this place is overrated complained not about the pizza, but had beef because the sarcastic Brooklyn girl up front wasn’t so nice to them. We get it - we have definitely been on the receiving end of some half-serious abuse from a Lucali waitress. As a matter of fact, I believe I was officially banned from the restaurant last time because I asked twice about the toppings.
Honestly though, for us, that’s all part of the game. Yes, it can be annoying to deal with an unpredictable situation, but for pizza this good, we’re willing to deal with it. It’s all about knowing what to expect going in, and understanding that you might not end up with a table, no matter what they told you twenty minutes ago. Want to save yourself some disappointment? Don’t bring your fiancé’s parents here. Don’t come without a backup plan. Don’t bring a date that you’re trying to impress with your restaurant game. Don’t try to hit Lucali before you have to catch a flight, report for military service, or do anything else that you can’t be late for. But if you’re down to just grab a bottle of wine and show up at 6pm, you might be diving into some of the best pizza this city (and therefore Planet Earth) has to offer. Read below for what might be the shortest Food Rundown in Infatuation history - your options are pizza or calzone. Order both."

Dinner at a Greenwhich Village sushi restaurant is definitely not on that list. That is, it wasn't on that list - until we ate at Tomoe.
OK, well it still isn't really on that list. Waiting in a line outside of any restaurant seems a bit silly to us, but Tomoe is arguably one of the best sushi restaurants in the city, as you will see by those patiently standing single file out front on most nights. And it certainly isn't the atmosphere that's got people queued up on Thompson Street. The place is a dump. A studio apartment with a sushi bar and some Japanese paraphernalia hanging on the wall to cover up holes and various electrical hazards. People line up for a table at Tomoe strictly because the sushi is excellent. Yes, prices are a bit high, and there are plenty of annoying things about the place that we could go on and on about. But at the end of the day it's a great once-in-a-while spot, when you're in serious need of something excellent. Those looking for a destination for Girls' Night Out, a First/Early in the Game Date, or a Birthday should look elsewhere. Tomoe is for getting down to business only.
Shumai
A must order when consuming sushi in my book, and worth an honorable mention. To be honest, these are good, but not mind-blowing - not much on the appetizer menu is. Save your dollars here and go deep on the sushi."

That's some Infatuation friendly marketing right there. When I think about Crif Dogs, I'm brought back to the blackout of 2003. How amazing was that? NYC turned into one big block party. The night it all went down, Crif Dogs was the only place in the East Village that had power because they were smart enough to have a backup generator for exactly such occasion. So while everyone else was sweating it out while food spoiled, Crif's happily cooked up dogs and topped off beers (on the house!) for the whole neighborhood. A classic NYC moment for sure, and a fond memory I’ll never forget.
Ever since the East Village started gentrifying, Crif Dogs has been there to support the lifestyle of the young, drunk, cash-strapped, and hungry. Open until 4am on the weekends and 2am during the week, C-Dogs is an all hours neighborhood hang, ideal for Late Night Eats, cheap beers, and a game of Ms. Pacman. There is one downside though. At night, big crowds of dude-bros gather, trying to impress their dates by being granted access into PDT, the not-so-secret cocktail lounge next door that you enter through a not-so-secret phone booth in the restaurant. We're over that hidden door, walk through a secret tunnel nonsense. Get in and get out with your dogs while the Jersey Shore plays the name drop game with the bouncer."

",3.0,American,Landmarc,5.8,"There was a time back in the day (2003) when we thought Landmarc was about as good as dinner out could get. I can't even remember why to be honest with you, I think it mostly comes from the fact that when we did go, it was before a show and we were with our music executive bosses and their corporate cards. To 23 year old Stang and Steinthal, a dinner at Landmarc was essentially one step closer to living like R. Kelly in the ""Ignition"" video. Cristal wasn't exactly poppin' in the stretch Navigator, but a steak that someone else paid for definitely made the dream feel a little closer to reality.
Fast forward seven or so years and our views on the place have changed quite a bit. Maybe the food has gone downhill, maybe our standards are higher, or maybe a few disastrous experiences at the Time Warner Center location have just soured us on the place, but Landmarc doesn't feel as special any more. As a matter of fact, it feels very mediocre and very over priced. Yes, there are decent eats to be had - breakfast is generally good, the mussels above average, and the steaks are tasty - but you'll spend more than you should, especially with so many better options in the area. At the end of the day, Landmarc just isn't worth the money. Go spend your hard earned cash somewhere with food everywhere as if the party was catered.

This dark, South American inspired wine and ceviche bar has just eighteen seats, all at the bar. It’s intimate and low key, and the fish is fresh and priced right.
There is no kitchen, which means you’ll have a front row seat as your food is prepared by a man who will also double as your bartender. Hopefully audience participation is something you’re comfortable with, as you may be called on to help your chef/bartender as he practices his “ghetto molecular gastronomy”.

We're not sure that Tipsy Parson feels particularly refined, but it definitely feels overthought. They've gone to great lengths to replicate a Southern country cafe in New York City, down to quirky plates decorating the wall, an antique phone, and kitschy old-fashioned desserts and snacks. But that's just the problem. After a few meals here it's apparent that they've done a perfect job of creating the concept, but at the cost of under-delivering on the food. The majority of the fare falls somewhere between unimpressive and decent -possibly a result of all that ""refining"". Comfort food is comfort food when eating it makes you feel like calories make you smarter and your problems don't exist. Fried chicken with honey and hot sauce on top of a fucking donut. That's comfort food. Unfortunately you won't find much of that feel-good decadence at Tipsy Parson. If you're in the neighborhood searching for a meal to soothe you, hit Cookshop.
Mushroom Tart
A tart with ricotta cheese and various mushrooms. Not bad, but nothing special.Ambrosia Salad
I know what ambrosia is, so I sort of knew what to expect when we ordered this, but smoked peppered marshmallows are not what I want in my salad, especially when there's nothing there to balance all that sweetness. The whole time I was expecting to unearth some halloween candy under all the greens. Unimpressive.Dayboat Scallops
A safe bet, but you definitely aren't coming here after a tough day to eat seared scallops and celery root puree. These were left unfinished at the table, which doesn't happen often when we eat.Pimento Cheeseburger
Available at brunch and lunch, which are generally better than dinner. This is a decent burger, especially because I love pimento cheese and haven't had it since I was a kid. Comfort points awarded. It's a bit sloppy, but enjoyable.Mac & Cheese
Probably the best thing we've had at Tipsy Parson, but you can't open up claiming Southern cooking and not serve a good mac and cheese.Hush Puppies

Nyonya is well known as one of the few real Malaysian restaurants in New York City. It is loved equally among people who were raised on food like this, and those that more casually enjoy cuisine of the region. The menu is huge, and you will find traditional Malaysian dishes like Nasi Lamak and Prawn Mee, but you'll also see Phad Thai and other more well known items. The food is excellent, and everything is cheap, which means plenty of room left in your budget for Tiger beers. After a few visits, we've decided our friends were right.

So, if what you’re after is a laid back spot where you can get a raw milk goat cheese from Italy, this is your joint.
Casellula is a cozy little room in Hells Kitchen, run by some serious fromage lovers. The owner was once the head cheese guru at The Modern, something I discovered when I saw a congratulatory letter from Danny Meyer hanging in the bathroom. You might think something like that should be displayed in the office or over the bar, but I guess I did read it while I peed. Well placed. The cheese selection is vast and some are incredibly tasty, each priced at six bucks. Don’t do dairy? Casellula is also good for a glass of wine and a casual meal.

Inside, it's actually not much different - a tiny dive of a space with condiments on the table and Bob Marley on the wall. Instead of peddling beer and cigarettes however, this joint deals in beef and poultry. The menu is insane - there are close to forty different burger and chicken sandwich options, which generally makes us nervous. Places that dress their meat up every which way are usually trying to shield you from the truth
- that the meat by itself is questionable. We're not shocked at all to find that the burgers are just that.
Speaking of questionable, how about the fact that Citysearch's team routinely slots Island in their burger Top 10. They must smoke a lot of weed and live around the corner...that's the only explanation. Honestly though, I'm not trying to hate. The chicken sandwiches are better than the burgers, and this place is pretty cheap considering the hugeness of the plates. Also, know this - they apparently don't have enough money to buy a fryer, and remain a very rare french-fry-free burger establishment. Hope you like chips. For a quick hitter in Hell's Kitchen, Island B&S; is a decent local option. Beyond that, please do us a favor and venture elsewhere for a burger more satisfying.
Churascos (Grilled Chicken Sandwich)
Our fellow food x music homeboy Rev from Burger Conquest  loves him some Island B&S; Churascos, so we had to try a couple. I enjoyed my ""Bourbon Street"" style sandwich (blackened chicken, bacon, jack, bayou mayo and onion on sourdough), although I was a little perplexed by the whole sourdough thing. Too much bread. Made the wrong call there. This thing is HUGE by the way, good luck trying to finish it all and still have room for a shake.Burgers
So, I'm going to have to disagree with the everyone on the internet who claims this is a quality burger. Yelper Matt E, who calls this burger the ""juiciest, thickest, and freshest burger I've ever had that wasn't home made"", I'm lookin' in your direction. These things are on par with the ones my college roommate used to sear up on a frying pan. Not necessarily the worst thing ever, it's just very far away from the best thing ever. Good thing you can dress the burgers with just about any topping your burnt out college brain can imagine.Shakes
We tried both the Black & White (vanilla with chocolate sauce) and Chocolate. They were both fine, but definitely not life changing. When I'm sitting in my Midtown office craving a milkshake (which happens a lot), I'll continue hitting Ben & Jerry's in Rock Center."

There was some kind of Daniel Faraday/Lost island style frequency sucking us inside even though our lives were supposed to go down a different path that night. We couldn’t resist it. We bailed on our plans and hit the Highlands.
As we suspected, Highlands is an Infatuation kind of joint. Rows of whiskey and bourbon line the exposed brick walls behind the bar. A packed house of put together, good looking locals sip on dark drinks, specialty cocktails and international beers with high alcohol content. Everyone is feelin’ it and having a grand ol’ time. Although we haven’t been on the weekend, we hear it’s slammed shoulder to shoulder, Spotted Pig style.
Traditionally Scottish, this gastropub brings the likes of cullen skink (fish and potato soup) and haggis (sheep’s ‘pluck’, heart, liver & lungs) to the Big Apple. It’s certainly the only place in the West Village that actually has faggot listed on the menu. Although it may be PC where they come from, we’re more comfortable pointing to it on the menu than actually saying it out loud. In typical Scottish fashion, the food was just ok, but if you pick and choose your dishes carefully, you can have a good meal. The meat plate, cockles, haggis and lamb shank are the way to go.

Actually, if that's the case I should probably make this a 10.0...sorry grandma. I'm half Lebanese and grew up eating food like this at family gatherings, so I think it's a pretty big compliment to Balade when I say this reminds me of what grandma has coming out of the kitchen on holidays. The only reason Balade doesn't get a ridiculously high rating is because I don't think most people have any idea what a lot of this food is. Obviously you've had hummus, or at least some bastardized Whole Foods version with edamame in it (more on that later), and chances are you've seen some stuffed grape leaves or spinach pies on a menu at a Greek restaurant. Whatever the case, if you don't know much about Lebanese food, you should just know that if you like garlic, olive oil, lemon, and meat - you're probably going to like what you eat at Balade.
There are are a handful of Lebanese restaurants in New York City, and many of them are very good. Some of the newer ones though, like Naya and ilili, are slick, modern, and high end. Balade is certainly no hole in the wall, but it's relaxed and warm - much more our speed than those other spots. I don't care what kind of food you're serving, I don't want to listen to a DJ spin while I eat. Ever. So Balade gets a leg up for being the right kind of atmosphere, but most importantly, everything coming out of the kitchen is seasoned correctly. Food like this gets screwed up when people hold back. Not here. Everything we ordered was fantastic, and had the right amount of lemon juice, olive oil, and key spices. The service is good, people are friendly, and you can eat your face off for about twenty bucks a person. Rookie or expert, that's hard not to like."

",3.0,Japanese,Kanoyama,7.7,"New York’s sushi joints can be broken down into three tiers. Tier One places serve fish that melts in your mouth and makes the other places look silly. Think Sushi Yasuda and Masa. These are the priciest of the pricey, but every once in a while you can find a Tier One diamond in the rough that won’t do a Madoff on your bank account.
Tier Two consists of sushi restaurants that aren't nearly as special, but are a hell of a lot more affordable. These places tend to focus more on specialty rolls, but great nigiri and sashimi can be had as well. Poke and Yama are Tier Two type places.
The third tier consists of sushi best saved for lunch at your desk or a light meal in a pinch
 - we’re talking one step above the boxed stuff at Midtown delis.
Kanoyama is a prime example of that Tier One diamond in the rough. This is some of the best sushi you’ll find for the money in Manhattan, with fish that’s imported fresh daily and served in an enjoyable atmosphere. Friday and Saturday nights are slammed and can be problematic since they take limited reservations, so weekday dinner is the way to go.

Everyone on the internet certainly paid attention. Hands down, The Breslin was the single-most hyped restaurant opening of 2009. Like college kids camped out before Bonnaroo, hungry food bloggers set up shop in the Ace Hotel lobby for weeks, drinking Porkslap Pale Ale and sleeping on couches as they typed, tweeted, and texted The Breslin’s every move.
Not to say that we weren’t guilty of blowing up @infatuation with pictures of pig foot now and again, but we definitely tried to not get sucked in by the hype. We hit The Breslin as much as possible before fully weighing in, which wasn’t an easy task. It’s obviously one of the tougher tables in town. Over a two month span, we hit this place several times, for brunch, dinner, and everything in between.
So what do we think? We fully expected to be head over heels for The Breslin, but truth be told, it’s all just a bit too much. The food is brutally unhealthy, rich, and hearty. Some of it is good and some of it not so good, but no matter what, it’s going to hit you over the head. Those Breslin induced meat sweats NY Times scribe Sam Sifton describes in his review? Those are for real. You'll be feeling this meal in your gut for days. Aside from the food, the service is terrible and cost The Breslin some major points. Forget about industry experience, it seems like they had an open casting in Washington Square Park, signing up anyone with tattoos, a dirty flannel, and a below average IQ. These are not the same seasoned vets you'll find at The Spotted Pig. These are hip-looking kids who belong in class, not making our $14 drinks.

But after a few (five) glasses of wine, and some food, it became apparent that there is much more going on here.
Ardesia is first and foremost a wine bar, and a good one at that. The food is decent, but it’s secondary to what they do best, which is selecting excellent “mineral-driven” wines from all over the world. There are a ton of options to order by the glass, the prices are reasonable, and the service is super friendly. Go to drink, but when you inevitably need some food to soak up the wine, stick to a few simple things on the menu like the cod cakes and the pretzels.

",4.0,American,The Modern,7.8,"Danny Meyer. Gobbling up screen time on this site just like he's gobbling up restaurant space all over town. We finally got around to a review of The Modern, and it's about time, they needed more good press. Or wait a minute, no they didn't. Along with a Michelin Star and constant raves, Chef Gabriel Kreuther was honored recently with a James Beard award for Best Chef: NYC. We're actually still waiting to find out if we won for Most Influential Food Website: Earth. They'll call or something right?
The best way for us to give you the lowdown on this place is to explain that it's really two different experiences: the bar, and the dining room. The dining room is a beautiful, formal space overlooking the MoMa garden with a three course prixe fixe menu. It's fine dining for sure, and it's incredibly good. Think of it as a more ""modern"" Eleven Madison Park.The bar area is quite a bit different. It's sleek, more relaxed, and on a good night, you'll find some Action at the Bar. The plates are smaller and a bit more restrained, but you will still get A plus service and have a decent meal. We like the bar just fine, but what it really comes down to is this: That James Beard award didn't get handed over for restraint and small plates. Chef Kruether is rocking a new neck accessory because of what's happening in the dining room. So if you're looking for a place to take grandma to dinner after you freak her out at the Tim Burton exhibit, bump this rating up a full point. It's a top notch restaurant, but the bar can be a bit hit-or-miss, and if we're doing it fancy, Eleven Madison park is more our speed."

",3.0,American,Cafe Cluny,7.9,"More so than any other section of NYC, West Village restaurants have a common neighborhood feel to them. Like the people who flock to them, these spots are understated, stylish, and well groomed.
Next time you’re grabbing food in the West Village, avoid the two hour wait at Joseph Leonard, don’t even consider the place next door, and get your Cluny on. It’s excellent for breakfast, and is a reliable option for lunch and dinner as well."

",3.0,American,Good,5.9,"When you name your restaurant Good, it damn well better be just that. Mediocrity ain't gonna cut it, and you better impress. Thanks mainly to the food, Good stays relatively true to its name. It’s a useful neighborhood option, good for a meal at anytime of day. It gets crazy for brunch and rightfully so, they do good work with eggs. For West Village locals, they’re a heavy rotation delivery spot as well. It's not all good all the time though. The quality of the food and setting in which you eat doesn't do the menu justice, everything seems to be $4-5 too expensive. It's essentially a not as good, West Village version of Infatuation faves The Smith and Jane, and it's more expensive. The décor is nothing special and the service is consistently not be good. Lastly, beware of sitting up front near the fly infested windows - you might as well be eating your breakfast burrito in Somalia."

",2.0,American,Jane,7.8,"Head spinning after a long day of getting dragged around Soho with the female? Find salvation in a crisp Blue Point Toasted Lager draft and steak frites at Jane. It'll help restore the equilibrium. The predecessor to fratty East Village favorite The Smith, Jane is its slightly more sophisticated older sister. Holdin' it down in a prime location just above Soho, Jane is the epitome of utility neighborhood staple. A warm, friendly ambiance and diverse menu of relatively simple, but flavorful dishes make it perfect for Early In The Game Dates, Dinner With The Parents, Groups of 4-6 and Chronic Brunch. Jane has long been an Infatuation standby, and that's not changing anytime soon. Next time you're looking for a low-key, reasonably priced meal, hit up our girl Jane."

",1.0,Burgers,Corner Bistro,8.4,"History. Corner Bistro is filled with it - and to fully understand why we back the Bistro so hard, we need to drop a little history lesson:
Before it was the first-ever name of this website, “Immaculate Infatuation” was a made-up British rock band that my college friends and I dressed up as for Halloween one year. (Think Guns N’ Roses meet a British version of Motley Crue.) After the band retired, Immaculate Infatuation lived on as the name of my fantasy football team, and when Stang and I needed to figure out what to call our new venture, the choice was obvious.
But before the Infatuation went live April 1st 2009, about a million other potentially genius plans were discussed. Thankfully, the initial idea of starting our own record label never materialized (that would have been a disaster), and our clothing line (called “My Future”) only wound up producing a single t-shirt. My point? All this talk happened somewhere, and more often than not, it happened at the Bistro. There’s something about pounding cheap beers and burgers here that makes you feel like anything is possible. When we finally decided it was go time for The Infatuation, we were sitting in Corner Bistro. Look hard enough and you’ll find it engraved in one of the back booths. That’s our Corner Bistro story, I’m sure you have your own as well. If these walls could talk, they’d give away all our secrets."

",3.0,Seafood,Mermaid Oyster Bar,6.9,"When we heard about The Mermaid Inn opening an ""Oyster Bar"" in the Village, we were fired up like burnouts scrambling for tickets to the Phish shows at MSG. We've been frequenting the East Village location for years now, and the uptown outpost is just as good. They both serve up great fish and a nice lobster roll, and you'll be hard pressed to find a safer bet for a First/Early in the Game Date. I also just recently had an incredible meal at Neptune Oyster in Boston and it's been on the brain ever since. So naturally, we went in to the new Mermaid optimistic and ready to throw down some bivalves. Now, the place has all of the same appealing qualities as it's predecessors and the food is good, but an oyster bar? I guess fifteen or so varieties qualify you, but we were hoping for a deeper raw bar and a little more excitement. Where's the oyster inspiration? How about an oyster stew, maybe a po' boy? The menu is standard Mermaid Inn fare, which is fine, but we had hopes for something a little more inventive. What it comes down to is that the Oyster Bar is perfect for mid-day beers and a dozen on ice, but it's really just another Mermaid Inn. Hit up Flex Mussels if you're looking for some inspired variations on a theme."

",3.0,Wine Bar,Bocca di Bacco,7.2,"Midtown wine bars are pretty high up there on the list of places you won't find us hanging out. Why? Well, first of all, the majority of them are slightly less exciting than having a glass or two inside your local Pottery Barn. Second, we're not so down with the menus rife with shitty pizzas and cubed cheese served on cutting boards. Oh, and that fig thrown in next to the pile of Wheat Thins? Yeah, that's not fooling anybody.
On the surface, Bocca di Bacco doesn't look much different than any of those places. What is interesting, though, is that the food is actually very good. On the menu is an extensive offering of Italian small plates, pastas, and tasty full sized entrees to accompany all the wines that pour from a giant wine keggerator behind the bar. The crowd is a nice mix of Hell's Kitchen's hottest residents and some downtowners that know where to get good eats when they're in the area. We went in on a Twitter recommendation and have now had two solid meals at Bocca di Bacco, along with some nice wines by the glass that didn't put too bad of a hurting on the wallet. I'm glad we gave it a chance. The ridiculous house music on the website almost doomed it from the start."

",3.0,Mexican,Hell's Kitchen,7.2,"As you can imagine, Hell's Kitchen can be a confusing answer to the question, “where should we have dinner?” Both the restaurant and the neighborhood from which it takes its name are a culinary unknown to most that don‘t live in the area. If you live there, chances are you constantly tell your friends about all the great restaurants you know about and yet you still can‘t get anyone to come eat with you. We are admittedly a little in the dark when it comes to Hell's Kitchen neighborhood favorites, but working and seeing shows in the area demands that you have a go-to spot. Our go-to in Hell's Kitchen is, well, Hell's Kitchen.
The casual but hip restaurant is not an attempt at authentic Mexican, but rather an inspired interpretation using Latin flavors and fresh ingredients. Think Rosa Mexicano but far less annoying, and much better entrées. The dinner hours are always crowded and noisy, as a Mexican restaurant should be. Lunch is usually less busy and equally delicious, but Hell's Kitchen is best enjoyed when the eating is accompanied with heavy tequila and beer drinking."

",3.0,French,Bar Boulud,8.0,"On a recent weekend night, a disastrous attempt at having dinner at Landmarc
in the Time Warner Center resulted in an impromptu visit to Bar Boulud. Let me
set the scenario before I get into the Bar Boulud review. The Time Warner
Center Landmarc is essentially New York City's Rainforest Cafe...true mall
dining at its finest. It was an absolute zoo, there were tables crammed into
every square inch of available space, and the hosts and bartenders clearly
hate their lives. I'm pretty sure they would have asked us to have dinner on
the floor if the place got any busier. Needless to say, we closed out our bar
tab and got the cuss out of there. Desperately looking for a civilized meal
and a drink, we wandered over to Bar Boulud, sure that a Friday night walk-in
would illicit some French snobbery. Surprisingly, they politely sent us to the
bar for a quick glass of wine and we had a table within ten minutes.
Bar Boulud is Daniel Boulud's ""casual bistro"", but by Infatuation standards
this is a fancy restaurant. It's an older crowd, but a seemingly loose one as
the restaurant feels upbeat and lively. The service is first class, but not
the slightest bit stiff. As for the food, you'll find a long list of pates and
terrines, but otherwise, it's a pretty straightforward bistro. Pay attention
to the specials, and the fish selections are spectacular. Salads and starters
are tasty, and the wine list is well priced and full of lesser known varietals
that will have you taking notes and chasing down bottles online. What‘s the
takeaway here? Don't let the French formalities scare you off. Bar Boulud is
fantastic."

",2.0,Spanish,Tia Pol,7.8,"Tia Pol is an ultimate Infatuation First/Early In The Game Date spot. Take the edge off, have a couple of glasses of wine, maybe some sangria while you’re at it too, and conversation will be flowing freely by the time you’ll be sharing quality small plates. Just beware, there’s pretty much a standard thirty minute wait at Tia Pol. I suppose that might come in handy, should you need some time to realize that the person you brought is a snooze, and you need to bail after one drink.
Alternatively, come here with a large group and share everything on the menu. Just don't attempt coming in with a group larger than three without a reservation."

",3.0,French,L'Express,7.7,"L'Express is an Infatuation MVP - a staple in the repertoire that is good for just about everything from casual dinner with friends, to business lunch, to drinks and crossing your fingers on a first date.
The menu sports French classics like escargot and duck a l'orange, but good ole USA eats like burgers and sandwiches are plentiful as well. Brunch, lunch, and dinner are all excellent and unshakably consistent, but we especially love this 24 hour French brasserie for the New York City menagerie that it becomes at three in the morning. Late at night the restaurant fills with a colorful crowd of drunks looking for something other than a diner omelet to help them survive the morning. We're with them.
Somehow that lamb burger tastes even better when you're on the precipice of a full on black out."

",4.0,Italian,Mike's Bistro,6.6,"When you wear a yarmulke, your culinary options are pretty limited. While New York is one of the few cities in the US that actually has a handful of kosher options, at their price points, they are competing with the most expensive restaurants in the city. That's pretty rough given that the rules of the kosher diet limit how meat can be prepared (no butter, no milk). While you know you'll be guaranteed a quality piece of meat when you go kosher, the execution can at times fall short, making it difficult to justify the high price tag.
Since I have a number of kosher friends in my life, I've dined at places like Tevere (easily my favorite), Solo (where Top Chef winner Hung had a stint as head chef) and Prime Grill (most overpriced, average steak in Manhattan), all of which generally left me feeling unfulfilled and, well, broke. For the price of a lot of these places we could be eating at Eleven Madison Park and properly indulging. Always keeping an open mind however, when a Kosher friend and devoted Infatuation reader wanted to take us to her favorite Kosher spot to see how it measured up to our standards, we were down to give it a go and head to Mike's Bistro on the Upper West Side.
Mike's Bistro is a big deal in the world of kosher restaurants. Although its appearance might suggest differently, this is a popular special occasion spot, especially with the younger generation. It's plain and rather boring decor give Mike's the feel of a glorified basement. Excessive wood (not in a cool rustic way, but in an ordinary kitchen cabinet way) and bright lights are a bit of a turn off. Good thing the food isn't. A clear Italian influence makes this menu more ambitious than most kosher spots and I'd happily return."

",2.0,Spanish,Boqueria,7.1,"A few things to note before we get into it. First, this is a review of the Boqueria on 19th St., not of any of the other locations. Boqueria Soho has a different dynamic and clientele, and works for drinks, casual group meals, or catch-up dinners. Second, let us preface this by saying that we’ve been coming to Boqueria for a while now, and we generally enjoy the place. The only problem is that the food is hit or miss. The best bets on the menu tend to be the more simple items like brussels sprouts, pan con tomate, and anything with chorizo. The wine list is good and reasonably priced (plenty of bottles priced under forty dollars), and the churros are pretty excellent. Maybe even better than the ones that dude sells on the L train platform. At the end of the day, the good at Boqueria is definitely good, and if you stick to the right things, you’ll probably walk away happy. Then again, when we’re craving some Spanish food we’re probably headed to La Vara or Casa Mono instead. For the purposes of this Food Rundown, we’re going to stick (mostly) to the stuff we liked."

",1.0,Bar Food,Old Town Bar,7.3,"Respect. We've got a lot of it for Old Town, a straight forward burgers, beer, and whisky kind of place. Over a century of Big Apple history lies within these walls, saturated into their prohibition-era marble bar and stained all over their vintage urinals and toilets. Old Town's no frills formula has been working for generations. It's all about the company you keep and beer you drink. It worked back when my grandfather used to come here for a game of checkers. It worked when my father used to come here with his law school buddies, and it works now when I want to grab a low key burger and beer with friends. Old Town is a true throwback. One of the few old-New York bar/restaurants that still exists in its original form from the 1800's, unfazed by NYC's always changing trends and fads.
Old Town sports a full menu of salads and sandwiches, all of which we're sure are relatively tasty in their own right. We wouldn't know though, because we come here for one reason and one reason only: burgers. Stick with what they do best and you'll be just fine."

",3.0,Pasta,Supper,7.9,"Frank Prisinazo (Frank, Lil' Frankies) pretty much has a monopoly over the Italian game in the East Village. Supper, his slightly more upscale Italian institution, has been mobbed since the day it opened. They don't take reservations, but they do have a nice wine bar next door to hang at while you wait. For a cash only operation (both the restaurant and wine bar), the wine list is steep. It's surprising that there aren't more two-digit options. The food menu, however, is packed with well executed, moderately priced Italian favorites in addition to the always changing specials (the reason we keep coming back). The seats outside on the sidewalk are nice, but we prefer this dimly lit spaghetti haunt on a freezing cold night the when oven in the middle of the room is keeping everyone warm."

",3.0,American,The Standard Grill,4.9,"New York Magazine recently wrote up The Standard Grill under the title ""Above Standard"". Well, guess what, we've got higher standards than that. While we loved spending a few hours blowing up Twitter with live commentary from that ridiculous scene, the bottom line is that the food at The Standard Grill is bad. This review almost got tagged with Wasting Your Time and Money, but the decent pork chop and constant parade of cougars and euros in and out of the place were worth a handful of points. The restaurant is massive, and includes a wrap around patio in front and a beer garden on the side, complete with ping-pong tables and picnic bench seating. Perfect for mixing it up with the business casual dudes that have since abandoned Brass Monkey. It seems the Standard Grill is the new place to See And Be Seen, whether you're a nightclub socialite, a recent Wisconsin grad, or a Real Housewife of New Jersey. I'm sure that the food is good enough to keep those types coming back, but we expect more, and if you're reading this website, chances are you do too. It's going to take more than a bowl of chocolate mousse and three spatulas (see the Food Rundown) to get us throwing around accolades. Go spend your hard earned dollars on something satisfying."

",3.0,Pasta,Crispo,7.7,"Crispo is another restaurant that falls into the category of long-time Infatuation favorite. The restaurant opened in the summer of 2002, and has since seen some strong competition open up in the neighborhood - Scarpetta, La Bottega, and the Standard Grill to name just a few. We hadn't been back in a while and recently decided to check in and see how the place is holding up.
Amazingly enough, Crispo is still hanging tough like Keith Richards' internal organs. They're drawing nice crowds most nights, and the food is exactly as we remembered - high quality Italian with great pastas, a nice selection of cured meats and antipasti, and a solid wine list. It seems that once again consistency is the key to success.
For the warm weather months (both of them) Crispo has a huge back garden that's a relatively well kept secret. Keep that one in your pocket and let everyone else flock to Paradou while you dine outside with people that don't suck."

The front room feels like you’ve walked into an Italian market with shelves of food and baskets of produce greeting you in the entryway. Mismatched vintage tables, stone walls, and an array of vintage furniture bring a homey vibe to the front room.
The back room is bigger and brighter, but still sports that same charm that makes you feel at ease the moment you enter. You can just sense that you are in for some good Italian cooking. A word to the wise, lean heavily on the pasta when ordering. That’s what separates Sfoglia from the pack."

",4.0,Italian,Bacaro,7.3,"We have reviewed plenty of restaurants on the Lower East side for this site, but Bacaro is really low and really east - in a part of town that's too dirty even for most of the cool kids (which means it's cool).
Though the food at Bacaro is pretty good, it's the kind of place you come to for the atmosphere. There is a small upstairs bar with tables, but under no circumstances should you pass up an opportunity to eat in the downstairs basement, or what I like to call the ""Dungeon of Romance"". Exposed brick, crystal chandeliers, one large white candle on each table...if you can actually manage to get a date to come to this part of Manhattan, at least know you're probably going to close the deal.
The menu is technically small plate Italian, but the plates aren't really all that small. About four dishes for a table of two is a good approach. Anything with a vegetable is a solid choice, but the pastas are hit and miss. It's also worth noting that Bacaro doesn't take reservations, which can make it a risky destination for an early in the game date. If the wait is long, you can hang at the upstairs bar and have a drink, but it's small. Then again, you can always go take a walk. Nothing says love like watching a guy in Chinatown skin a chicken.
Update: Bacaro now takes reservations."

Mexico Lindo is the needle in the haystack, and we've been satisfying our Mexican cravings there for years. A true family run establishment, Lindo has a homey feel, be it a quirky one. The best dishes in the house are the standards (tacos al carbon, fajitas, and enchiladas), although a few surprises on the menu keep things interesting. The black bean soup comes garnished with chopped red onion and banana, and is ridiculously good. Any steak dish is a winner, and the guacamole and salsa are very good.

",4.0,American,Eleven Madison Park,9.2,"Note: The menu at Eleven Madison Park has recently changed - we’ll be updating the review shortly.
Let’s be honest. White tablecloth fine dining establishments are not places that you will typically find the staff of The Infatuation. We like things a little bit looser, a little bit dirtier, and a little bit more laid back. That said, every once in a while a man needs to throw on a pair of wrinkle-free Dockers and dine like a gentleman. Every once in a while, a man also gets a gift card to a restaurant for his birthday.
Whatever the motivation, on a recent weekday night, we found ourselves heading for an Infatuation man date at Eleven Madison Park. It was clear from the start that this would not be a typical night out stuffing our faces with burgers and pork buns. The dinner menu at Eleven Madison Park consists of different prix fixe configurations, including an eleven course chef’s tasting menu. No, this would not be another night of casual eating. This night we were going to be tucking our napkins into our collars and doing things real fancy like.
Fancy though it may be, the restaurant is surprisingly lively, and the room wide open and airy - definitely not typical of a place serving this kind of food. Make no mistake, Eleven Madison Park is fine dining at its most serious. The staff is polite, yet rigid and focused like they’re on a mission from God. I think one of them folded my napkin with his mind. While the formality of the staff can be a little bit awkward at times, their knowledge and focus is appreciated when eating at this level. The food rundown will give you the details, but our meal at Eleven Madison Park was amazing. With a menu that sources many local ingredients via the Union Square Greenmarket, from start to finish, you get what you pay for and more. Save it for the right occasion. You won’t be disappointed."
