A counter and a glass case, for example, as well an area where you can spritz your pizza with chili flakes and burn your mouth on some cheese that’s only slightly hotter than the Earth’s core (if you’re an impatient kind of person). Mama’s Too has all of these things - but it isn’t your average counter-service pizza place.
This is a tiny spot on the Upper West Side, and it makes some of the best pizza within walking distance of Central Park. The main attraction here is the square slice covered in thick little pieces of pepperoni, the edges of which reach toward the sky as if thanking the pizza gods for making them so delicious. It’s crunchy on the bottom and crispy around edges, with a sweet and garlicky sauce under what would seem like an excessive amount of melted mozzarella, if melted mozzarella weren’t such an objectively desirable food.If you’ve ever been to Prince St. Pizza, all of this might sound familiar. You might even be thinking to yourself, “This sounds like Prince St.’s pepperoni square,” or, “I’d like a Prince St. pepperoni square right now.” In both cases, you would be correct. But that shouldn’t diminish your appreciation of this one. Fresh out of the oven, it’s a near-perfect mass of dough, cheese, and mildly spicy cured meat. Also, Mama’s Too has something Prince St. doesn’t: triangular slices worth going out of your way for. The house triangular slice comes spotted with cheese and sauce (similar to a leopard print) and topped with fresh basil. It’s big, but surprisingly light and a little bit crispy, and it’s something you’ll want to eat in large quantities, the way Pac-Man consumes those tiny dots. 
As good as the house slice is, though, the cacio e pepe (which, like everything here, you can get in either square or triangular form) is even better. It’s rich, salty, and covered in cheese, and it’ll convince you that every pasta should be brought to a lab and reverse-engineered into a pizza. The only problem is that you might not find it when you stop by 
- and that’s the one real downside of this place. Slices go quickly, and since you never know what will be available at a given time, a visit can feel like scratching off a lottery ticket or opening a pack of Pokemon cards circa 1999, hoping to get a Charizard. Sometimes you’ll get lucky, but sometimes you won’t.
The good news is, you can always order a whole pie of your favorite variety. This will probably result in an excess of pizza, but it will also make you a more charming and interesting-seeming person who’s suddenly extremely good at making friends. Because as much as this might look like your average slice place, the pizza at Mama’s Too is exceptional.

Some people have an internal meltdown when a company bowling outing is so much as mentioned, while others might be the enthusiastic ringleaders of a family reunion taking place on a cruise ship. We’re skeptical of those people on the cruise ship wavelength, but we also know that doing things with other human beings in an organized manner can sometimes be a good thing.
Omakase Room By Tatsu is a sushi place that’s sort of like a group trip, but without flip flops and nametags and with absolutely zero screaming. At this quiet, below-ground spot in the West Village, you and nine other people will be asked to arrive at precisely 6, 7:30, or 9pm. In the 90 minutes that follow, the 10 of you will receive, almost in unison, 18 pieces of top-quality, simply prepared sushi. You’ll order some sake or wine of your own choosing, but otherwise, this is a sushi meal that follows a close script. Fortunately, the sushi is very good, and you won’t be disappointed in the dozen and a half pieces that get placed in front of you.
While the choreographed, carefully-timed production makes for a nice meal with no real flaws, the strict 90-minute time frame does add pressure, and doesn’t allow for much cushion to finish off your sake leisurely. For $145 before tax and tip, it can feel like a short evening that you’re a bit rushed out of. Especially when your coat is brought over as you’re paying the check.
Of course, in most ways, Omakase Room By Tatsu is absolutely nothing like a group trip. For one, it’s extremely quiet, and there’s no music playing. That, paired with the minimalist space, makes this restaurant feel like a place you should sit up straight, pay attention, and refrain from using curse words.
Omakase Room By Tatsu serves a traditional omakase sushi meal that sushi purists in particular will enjoy. And if someone is nice enough to invite you, you’re in for some expertly-prepared fish.

If you had your pick, where would you go? The underground archives of The Met could be cool. Or the storage area of a Trader Joe’s might be a more strategic choice. Reality is, you’d probably end up in the basement of your own apartment or office building, clutching the water heater for emotional support.
But if we did have a choice of a basement to be stuck in, we’d pick Sushi Azabu.
Of course, plenty of restaurants and bars in NYC are located in basements, but this semi-hidden sushi spot in the quiet cobblestone part of Tribeca really has a particular underground feel. You do get the feeling that if nuclear winter finally started outside while you were eating a piece of fatty toro in Sushi Azabu, you might miss it.
Sushi Azabu serves one of the city’s best sushi omakase meals, and there are a few ways to go about eating here. You can sit at a table, where you can order things like a very good $68 nigiri set, or any number of pieces a la carte. But if you’re coming here, it should be for the experience of the omakase, at the bar. You can order this at a table too, but you’ll miss out on the interactions with the chef that add to the experience.The chef’s omakase is an impressive selection of incredible food that involves small appetizers, soup, sashimi pieces, a “toro tasting,” nigiri pieces, dessert, and a little dish in the middle called “grilled king crab with miso” that is one of the best single pieces of food we’ve eaten in recent memory. The sushi pieces here are good enough that you’ll find yourself wanting to write down the names of the fish in your Notes app, just to remember. They’re seasoned with things like a tiny bit of yuzu zest or a miniscule drop of chive paste, but mostly they highlight the freshness and quality of the fish and the skills of the chef.
At dinner, this costs $170 ($200 if you add an on an uni tasting, or $145 at lunch, during which you’ll also likely get even more of the chef’s attention). There’s also a nigiri-only version for $150, but it’s well worth paying up for the toro and the crab dish. When the bill comes, just tell yourself that maybe the world outside has ended and U.S. currency no longer has any value?Those prices, if it helps at all, also include service, which is excellent here. Upon realizing we were left-handed, a server moved our little hand wipe thing to the left side, and the friendly sushi chefs will also reach over to wipe down your platter regularly throughout the sushi part of the meal, so that each piece can shine.
By the time your meal finishes and you walk up the narrow staircase and back into the street and see that taxis and Tribeca strollers are passing you, you’ll be glad that the world is still intact, and that you can go tell someone about the sushi meal you just finished.",4.0,Japanese,Sushi Azabu,8.5,"When the apocalypse eventually comes for New York City, you’re going to have to find a good basement to bunker down.

You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice.

It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20.The last time you were in Penn Station, the most exciting things about the whole experience were the smell of someone else’s Shake Shack and the 20 minutes you spent thinking about how Amtrak should really have a “C.” But next time, you’ll go knowing there’s something nearby you can really look forward to - a spot with food so good you might decide to take the train to Baltimore more often.",2.0,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows.

Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20.The last time you were in Penn Station, the most exciting things about the whole experience were the smell of someone else’s Shake Shack and the 20 minutes you spent thinking about how Amtrak should really have a “C.” But next time, you’ll go knowing there’s something nearby you can really look forward to - a spot with food so good you might decide to take the train to Baltimore more often.","498 9th Ave, New York, NY 10018",Manhattan,10018,bleak sweaty place 34th street adult run 6 yard dash catch train baltimore ranger fan wait line buy tallboy paper bag child trip frozen wheely suitcase chasing indoor sparrow called penn station probably try avoid spending much time walk one block west four block north find little restaurant feel different place humanly possible relaxed atmosphere excellent central asian food farida spot actually want hang every angle small one room restaurant decorated mural object ranging pistol holster portrait young girl snowy mountain setting petting fawn watercolor animal aside best part room tv corner constantly playing uzbek music video like uzbek trl probably able turn away menu dish different cuisine including russian pickled herring borsht georgian really good rice lamb rib soup uzbek rest food meat eater missing best thing namely tender beef lamb come soup swordlike skewer uzbek plov rice pilaf dish love everything simply seasoned presented usually fresh dill top dish come chickpea pickled vegetable piece thick homemade bread side really go wrong general rule thumb come farida order manti flat circular dumpling come stuffed either beef pumpkin would make extremely nice throw pillow edible couch going find ticket holder waiting lounge one check ticket giant plastic wrapped chocolate chip muffin one similarity penn station farida extremely casual quite go farida use suitcase chair read issue u weekly k height penn station elegance show whenever wearing anything work clothes gym clothes concrete plan spend around 2 last time penn station exciting thing whole experience smell someone else shake shack 2 minute spent thinking amtrak really c next time go knowing something nearby really look forward spot food good might decide take train baltimore often,"(40.75561545, -73.9942678129495)",40.75561545,-73.9942678129495

Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book.

We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.

Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions.

There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal.

If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly.

They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember.",1.0,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones.

You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table.On paper, the bar snacks at The Polynesian look similar to dishes you’d get at a Murray Hill rooftop while sharing a couch with the former social chairs of Pi Kappa Alpha’s Georgetown chapter, but the food here is definitely worth snacking on while you drink. The crab rangoon has a thin, flaky shell with filling that’s mostly crab, and the ahi tuna poke is served over seaweed salad that tastes so briny you’ll have flashbacks to swimming face-first into ocean kelp and temporarily freaking out because, you know, the ocean is scary. But the thing that this place does best is actually fries. The crunchy, crinkle-cut fries here are topped with various spices and served with hoisin ketchup, and they belong in any debate about the best fries in the city.
The largest option on the 10-item food menu is a $19 plate of four baby back ribs, so this isn’t the place to have a full dinner. It is a fun rooftop bar to use for snacks and great cocktails when you’re in a part of the city that can make even proud Manhattanites daydream of a brownstone in Park Slope. Get a booth inside and listen to the soundtrack of Supertramp, Pharrell, and Prince with a few coworkers who want a post-work drink stronger than sauvignon blanc, or order something on fire at the outdoor bar when you want to turn things up many notches after date night in the Theater District.

You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel.

An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying.

It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub).

The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself.

Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist.

The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse.

The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything.

Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option.

It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga.

In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension.

To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out.

It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot.

Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes.

Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.

A meal at Shabushabu Macoron is expensive, but one thing you won’t question is whether the experience was worth it.
One last question: should we all go to that karaoke place?",4.0,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.

Blanca, the 19-course tasting menu restaurant hidden in the backyard at Roberta’s, is not outer space. But dinner here is like visiting another planet, and if you can find a way to experience it, you absolutely should.
Your launchpad for this spaceflight is the interior of Roberta’s - the first hipster base on planet Bushwick. You wait in the bar with some other half-nervous, half-excited people, until someone picks you up to lead you to the final frontier. Walking through Roberta’s, you pass giant picnic tables, strings of neon Christmas lights, and Brokeback Mountain pizza art, through a covered patio with a leaky roof, turning past the outdoor tiki bar, out into the giant yard. And then, suddenly, you see it. It’s another door you’ve never noticed before.
This leads to Blanca, a small cement room, filled only with an immaculate white bar, twelve brown leather stools, a sparkling silver kitchen, and a large table covered with dozens of wine glasses. This place doesn’t just feel like it’s a world away from Roberta’s - it feels like it’s a different world.The meal starts with a tiny bowl of caviar and pine nut, and it’s followed by a single paper-thin slice of pancetta. Then there’s maitake mushroom with uni and pear, agnolotti with poppy seeds and goat milk, and creamy pici pasta topped with more uni. Each dish is mind-blowing, and even more so if you opt for the wine pairing - which isn’t really a wine pairing. You’ll go from beer to wine to bubbles back to beer, each glass something you’ve likely never tried before, and you definitely didn’t expect to be served with whatever you’re eating.
About halfway through the meal, a chef brings over an inflated, charred sphere of bread. Like you in your sophomore year of college with a bag of wine, he slaps it. When it pops, it blasts a jet of steam, and flattens. This is your bread course, made from Roberta’s pizza dough. Maybe you’ve eaten it before, but this is is an entirely new experience.It’s one thing to feel like you’re in outer space. It’s another thing to realize that humans put you there.

The soundtrack is different every night, because it’s selected by one of the chefs, who reads the room in real time, and selects the playlist accordingly.

You walk out of the salon, catch your reflection in a shop window halfway down the block, and the only things in your head are the hairdresser’s compliments and the Getty Image of whoever inspired this new look in the first place. You could go home, send selfies to four people you wish you were dating, and order in $40 worth of delivery for yourself.
But what you really want is to go out somewhere, ideally someplace where people are waiting out front, who you’re annoyed you have to shoulder past to get to the host stand, but all the stares you get from people in designer jumpsuits make it worth it. The problem is, very few places like that serve good food, and even fewer cost the same as delivery and a decent bottle of malbec. Kiki’s is one of those rare spots.
This casual Greek restaurant on the Chinatown/LES border has been packed nightly, often with hour-long waits on weekdays (they don’t take reservations), since it opened in 2015. The crowds mostly look like they’re approaching their 10-year high school reunions, where they’ll show up late and break the ice with stories about who they just met at a Fashion Week afterparty. People are sitting at wooden tables or either of the two bars in the airy space, which feels like it could be a casual family-run spot near the water in Santorini.While the servers are more likely to be young Australians than elderly Greek ladies, the food here is still what you’d expect at a homey Greek restaurant. The uncomplicated, enjoyable dishes range from from lighter options, like smoked eggplant dip or grilled octopus, to heavier ones like melted cheese wrapped in phyllo dough and topped with honey. No matter what else you have on your table, make sure to get the lamb chops. They’re rich and a little charred, and served with an addictive housemade mustard and a mound of nicely spiced fries.
Given the scene and the quality of the food - plus the fact that the portions are pretty big - it’s all the more surprising that this place is relatively inexpensive. The dips and spreads, which come with very good fresh pita, are all $8, and most of the entrees are around $15.

Perhaps it’s the surprisingly affordable prices that make this place so popular, or maybe the owners here saw all the designer jumpsuits and decided that people have already spent enough. Either way, Kiki’s is worth the waits, and there’s no shortage of bars on the LES where you can show off that haircut until your table is ready.",2.0,Greek,Kiki’s,8.2,"You know that feeling right after you get a new haircut? You walk out of the salon, catch your reflection in a shop window halfway down the block, and the only things in your head are the hairdresser’s compliments and the Getty Image of whoever inspired this new look in the first place. You could go home, send selfies to four people you wish you were dating, and order in $40 worth of delivery for yourself.
But what you really want is to go out somewhere, ideally someplace where people are waiting out front, who you’re annoyed you have to shoulder past to get to the host stand, but all the stares you get from people in designer jumpsuits make it worth it. The problem is, very few places like that serve good food, and even fewer cost the same as delivery and a decent bottle of malbec. Kiki’s is one of those rare spots.
This casual Greek restaurant on the Chinatown/LES border has been packed nightly, often with hour-long waits on weekdays (they don’t take reservations), since it opened in 2015. The crowds mostly look like they’re approaching their 10-year high school reunions, where they’ll show up late and break the ice with stories about who they just met at a Fashion Week afterparty. People are sitting at wooden tables or either of the two bars in the airy space, which feels like it could be a casual family-run spot near the water in Santorini.While the servers are more likely to be young Australians than elderly Greek ladies, the food here is still what you’d expect at a homey Greek restaurant. The uncomplicated, enjoyable dishes range from from lighter options, like smoked eggplant dip or grilled octopus, to heavier ones like melted cheese wrapped in phyllo dough and topped with honey. No matter what else you have on your table, make sure to get the lamb chops. They’re rich and a little charred, and served with an addictive housemade mustard and a mound of nicely spiced fries.
Given the scene and the quality of the food - plus the fact that the portions are pretty big - it’s all the more surprising that this place is relatively inexpensive. The dips and spreads, which come with very good fresh pita, are all $8, and most of the entrees are around $15. They even have a few house wines, and while they’re fairly bland examples of popular Greek varietals, at $24 per liter, you’re not going to be complaining.

The first thing you’ll have to decide on is which of the seven moles to order. The mole poblano is great - but as long as you’re here, you should get one of the less common varieties. If you want something rich, but less sweet than the poblano, get the mole negro. Or if you’d like a mole that’s nutty, mild, and the color of Cool Whip, go for the blanco. And if it’s been a while since you felt something, try mole Oaxaqueno. It’s the color of a Ferrari at sunset, and the cloves inside will make you think about December while you simultaneously notice that your mouth is starting to burn.These seven moles are only a fraction of the dishes you can eat here. La Morada also serves tortas, tostadas, bacon-wrapped shrimp, crispy gorditas stuffed with your choice of filling, and some excellent tacos on homemade tortillas - the al pastor ones are like warm little gifts filled with pork.

Maybe you have one list of the people you actively avoid, another list of bodegas that don’t have cats (or do, depending on how you feel about cats lurking behind stacks of paper towels), and one more involving casual places that serve really good, affordable food where you could show up anytime. If you spend any portion of your waking life downtown, Kopitiam belongs on that third list.This all-day Malaysian cafe used to have a small location on Canal Street serving mainly sweets and drinks, and a very short list of savory snacks (though you couldn’t spend much time sitting down to eat them, since there were only three or four seats). That old place closed in 2017, and the new location not only has at least four times as much space, but also a much more extensive menu, and the kind of atmosphere we’d recommend for any type of low-key meal - not just takeout lunch or coffee and a snack.
To be clear, the new Kopitiam is still very casual. You order from a laminated menu at the counter, take a number, get your own silverware and bowls, eat happily, and then bus your table. You might see some families, some people on dates, and some solo diners on dates with their phones - all of whom are there for the same reason you are. To hang out and eat some some affordable food that’s good enough to hold its own against what you’d find at more expensive full-service restaurants.That food ranges widely, there’s buttered toast and chicken wings to noodle soups and desserts. Since Kopitiam serves food all day, you can get breakfast - which includes everything from fish ball soup to sugary Malaysian-style French toast - anytime. And starting at lunchtime, there’s even more to choose from. Like spicy cold sesame noodles, an oyster omelette, and a rice dish with dried fish that comes wrapped in a banana leaf. Overall, the best things Kopitiam makes are light, with a combination of sweet and salty flavors. A great example of this is the pan mee soup, which has wide hand-pulled noodles, bits of pork, a sweet anchovy broth, and enough dried fish to use as bait to catch another, larger fish. It’s our favorite thing here.
So the next time you get hungry in between avoiding the people on your first mental list and the cats on your second, remember that Kopitiam belongs at the top of your third  (the list of casual places you could go anytime to eat something really good).

And, while a part of you is skeptical, you can’t help but feel a little warm and fuzzy inside. This, in a nutshell, is the West-Bourne experience.
West-Bourne is a California-themed counter-service cafe in Soho where you’ll want to hang out after you finish your food and the majority of things taste like they were designed to make you a better person. It’s entirely vegetarian, and after a meal here, you’ll feel like you took a brief trip to a world where everything is made with care and people smile more often than they should.
Walk inside, and you’ll find a fridge stocked with juice and rosé. Next to that, there are some shelves full of branded t-shirts, tote bags, and napkins made from “reclaimed denim.” The rest of the little space is filled with some communal tables, a counter surrounded by little wooden stools, and a window nook with an excessive number of throw pillows. Factor in the brick walls and wooden ceiling beams, and the whole place makes your average counter-service spot look like a dumpster fire in a field of other dumpster fires.The first time you see West-Bourne, you might even assume it’s the sort of restaurant where the food is an afterthought. But everything here is fresh and flavorful, and even the healthiest things are worth your time. The “Over The Rainbowl,” for example, is mostly just a bunch of pickled and raw vegetables with lentil falafel - but it’s good and filling, and will help you picture an alternate universe in which you grow your own food. The rest of the menu consists of things like honey-roasted eggplant and shaved cauliflower with sheep’s cheese, as well as some less-healthy options like a mushroom reuben and sweet potatoes that taste like they’re about 50% butter. Those last two items aren’t as healthy as the rest, but all of these dishes are consistently excellent and more ambitious than what you expect from a place where you bus your own table. 
As an added bonus, West-Bourne donates 1% of its sales to a nearby nonprofit, which is just one more reason why you should get a quick breakfast or lunch here the next time you’re downtown. Sure, it can get a little crowded, and all the pillows and custom denim napkins might cause you to black out momentarily and have a nightmare about a world in which we live our entire lives on social media.

But others don’t seem to fit into any mold at all - like the movie The Room, or you, according to your mother. Or Holy Ground. Come here to have an unusual dining experience - but just know that some of its surprises are less enjoyable than others. 
The best part about Holy Ground is the setting. It’s in a very cool underground space in Tribeca with red leather booths, low ceilings, and vintage speakers playing instrumental jazz. But while plenty of steakhouses in the city feel like spots where F. Scott Fitzgerald could be at the next table drinking gin and casually lighting other people’s cigarettes, Holy Ground isn’t quite like any of those. Mainly because it isn’t actually a steakhouse.Holy Ground focuses on slow-smoked meats, serving the types of cuts you typically find at counter-service BBQ places: pork shoulder, brisket, and racks of spare ribs, along with sides like collard greens and mac and cheese. But this is also not a typical BBQ spot. There are red cloth napkins instead of paper ones, $16 cocktails instead of canned beer, and the brisket is wagyu. Plus, the primary flavors in most dishes here come from sauces rather than the meat, bark, or smoke.
Besides going in with the understanding that Holy Ground is neither a steakhouse nor a typical BBQ joint, it’s also important to order correctly. Stay away from the tough slab of pork shoulder, and don’t blow your tax refund on the chewy prime rib (which costs $120). Instead, go with the rich beef rib and the sweet and smoky chicken. Most importantly, get one or four orders of the crispy potatoes, which are served over a pool of mustard aioli - this side dish is the best thing here.Other parts of the experience are less enjoyable. In a Tribeca spot where you’re paying twice as much as usual for most of the cuts of meat on the menu, you’d at least expect the staff to be helpful, if not particularly friendly. Instead, the hosts remind us a little of apathetic antagonists from ‘90s teen movies, and servers disappear for long stretches of time and don’t have much to offer when asked about the wine and food. Rather than making this place feel trendy or exclusive, it all just comes off as unwelcoming and disorganized.
Inconsistent service and menu misses aside, if you order correctly and go in with the right expectations, it’s still easy to have a good night at Holy Ground. Walk down the steps into a space that feels a century old, drink a sazerac at the bar while reminding yourself that you should get more into jazz, and fill the table in front of your red leather booth with cuts of meat you’ve only ever eaten off wax paper.

Would you rather find out first that your dachshund went on a long vacation, or that your parents replaced it with a poodle? Where The Black Ant is concerned, we’ll start with the good news.
This upscale Mexican spot has been around in the East Village since 2014, and it’s still an enjoyable place to hang out. The servers are always friendly, and not in a way that makes you think they had a two-week boot camp on how to smile politely and fold napkins. They make conversation, pour big glasses of wine, and dance to the music coming from the speakers - which is played at that goldilocks volume where Shazam only takes a second to recognize a song, but you can still clearly hear your date’s response to your question about which wild animal they’d want most as a pet. If you only come here to drink the cocktails, which are mostly spicy and all great, then you’ll probably have a very good time. The problem is that this place isn’t a bar. It’s a restaurant, and the food just isn’t very good.The tacos come on decent housemade tortillas, but you’ll be more eager to finish those than the stuff inside them. The few slices of pineapple in the pineapple tacos have had all the sweetness grilled out of them, and two bites in, you’ll be $14 poorer with a couple of half-eaten, bare tortillas left on your plate. The fish tacos have a lot more going on, with slaw and spicy aioli, but the swordfish ranges from being really fishy and barely breaded, to all breading and very little bland fish.
Things only go downhill as you move on to the larger dishes, which include a dry chicken breast, mushy octopus, and some duck dumplings with almost no duck. Most entrees go too heavy on salt, spice, and sauces, which overwhelm everything else on the plate. The one-note duck dumplings taste strictly like the chocolatey mole they’re doused in, and the octopus is salty enough to dry your mouth out for the rest of the night. 
So that’s the bad news, but just as a reminder, there was good news too. The Black Ant is still a solid place for Happy Hour, or rounds of smoky jalapeno margaritas outside with a friend.

That magic comes from unpredictable factors, like who you end up meeting, what music is playing, and whether your cool pants fit. But Oxomoco, an upscale Mexican restaurant in Greenpoint, is the kind of place that lays the rest of the groundwork for you.
If you like to mitigate risk at every opportunity, you can make a reservation. If you don’t, you’ll probably encounter a wait. But fortunately, this doesn’t mean you have to go into fight-or-flight mode, frantically searching for a plan B to salvage your night. Instead, you can hang on the front patio if the weather’s nice, or at the long indoor bar if it’s not. The cocktail list is one of the best things about this place, and there are drinking snacks like spiced mango and lime and chile popcorn to keep you from getting hangry. One crucial step at this point is ordering a frozen margarita or paloma. It’ll come in a glass that’s half the size of your head, and if you’re looking to set the tone for your night, this is how you do it.Once your table is ready inside, you’ll be glad you waited. The dining room is a high-ceilinged space that’s covered in white paint and green plants, which doesn’t make it unique. But some other things do: the big round booths that make you feel like it’s your birthday even if it’s not, the chef’s counter overlooking the wood-fired grill, and the kind of good lighting typically only achieved with a filter.None of this would matter if it all ended in disappointing food. But that won’t happen here, as long as you primarily focus on the grilled dishes. Oxomoco is owned by the people behind Speedy Romeo, a pizza restaurant that makes all of its dishes over open fire, and the best things at Oxomoco are cooked in the same way - like the pollo a las brasas. It’s a grilled half-chicken that comes to your table covered in salsa and pickled onions, with sides of housemade tortillas and crispy red rice you will want to shovel into your mouth as quickly as possible. 
That chicken setup is our favorite way to eat tacos at Oxomoco, but a few of the ones listed in the actual taco section of the menu come close - like the lamb barbacoa, the beet chorizo, and the masa tempura shrimp. Otherwise, there are some raw fish starters, which you don’t need to be ordering unless you have a taco allergy. You do, however, need to be ordering the tlayuda - a pizza-sized tortilla topped with melted cheese, crema, grilled corn, hot sauce, and fresh herbs. Even if the rest of your night involves meeting someone who shares your interest in sloths, or Jerry Seinfeld cutting you in the bathroom line, or dancing on a table while singing along to ABBA (as sung by Cher), this tlayuda is what you’ll wake up thinking about tomorrow.
The tlayuda is also one of the most affordable dishes on a menu that overall feels slightly overpriced. The guacamole is $14 (the same price as one of the cocktails) and three fish tacos will set you back $24. We say this to you now, because it’s the only real thing at Oxomoco that runs the risk of ruining the fact that you’re three giant margaritas in, and you look good in those pants. Now go enjoy the rest of your night.",3.0,Mexican,Oxomoco,8.1,"You never really know whether it’s going to be a great night.

But some other things do: the big round booths that make you feel like it’s your birthday even if it’s not, the chef’s counter overlooking the wood-fired grill, and the kind of good lighting typically only achieved with a filter.None of this would matter if it all ended in disappointing food. But that won’t happen here, as long as you primarily focus on the grilled dishes. Oxomoco is owned by the people behind Speedy Romeo, a pizza restaurant that makes all of its dishes over open fire, and the best things at Oxomoco are cooked in the same way - like the pollo a las brasas. It’s a grilled half-chicken that comes to your table covered in salsa and pickled onions, with sides of housemade tortillas and crispy red rice you will want to shovel into your mouth as quickly as possible. 
That chicken setup is our favorite way to eat tacos at Oxomoco, but a few of the ones listed in the actual taco section of the menu come close - like the lamb barbacoa, the beet chorizo, and the masa tempura shrimp. Otherwise, there are some raw fish starters, which you don’t need to be ordering unless you have a taco allergy. You do, however, need to be ordering the tlayuda - a pizza-sized tortilla topped with melted cheese, crema, grilled corn, hot sauce, and fresh herbs. Even if the rest of your night involves meeting someone who shares your interest in sloths, or Jerry Seinfeld cutting you in the bathroom line, or dancing on a table while singing along to ABBA (as sung by Cher), this tlayuda is what you’ll wake up thinking about tomorrow.
The tlayuda is also one of the most affordable dishes on a menu that overall feels slightly overpriced. The guacamole is $14 (the same price as one of the cocktails) and three fish tacos will set you back $24. We say this to you now, because it’s the only real thing at Oxomoco that runs the risk of ruining the fact that you’re three giant margaritas in, and you look good in those pants. Now go enjoy the rest of your night.","128 Greenpoint ave, New York, NY 11222",Brooklyn,11222,never really know whether going great night magic come unpredictable factor like end meeting music playing whether cool pant fit oxomoco upscale mexican restaurant greenpoint kind place lay rest groundwork like mitigate risk every opportunity make reservation probably encounter wait fortunately mean go fight flight mode frantically searching plan b salvage night instead hang front patio weather nice long indoor bar cocktail list one best thing place drinking snack like spiced mango lime chile popcorn keep getting hangry one crucial step point ordering frozen margarita paloma come glass half size head looking set tone night table ready inside glad waited dining room high ceilinged space covered white paint green plant make unique thing big round booth make feel like birthday even chef counter overlooking wood fired grill kind good lighting typically achieved filter none would matter ended disappointing food happen long primarily focus grilled dish oxomoco owned people behind speedy romeo pizza restaurant make dish open fire best thing oxomoco cooked way like pollo la brasas grilled half chicken come table covered salsa pickled onion side housemade tortilla crispy red rice want shovel mouth quickly possible chicken setup favorite way eat taco oxomoco one listed actual taco section menu come close like lamb barbacoa beet chorizo masa tempura shrimp otherwise raw fish starter need ordering unless taco allergy however need ordering tlayuda pizza sized tortilla topped melted cheese crema grilled corn hot sauce fresh herb even rest night involves meeting someone share interest sloth jerry seinfeld cutting bathroom line dancing table singing along abba sung cher tlayuda wake thinking tomorrow tlayuda also one affordable dish menu overall feel slightly overpriced guacamole 14 price one cocktail three fish taco set back 24 say real thing oxomoco run risk ruining fact three giant margarita look good pant go enjoy rest night,"(40.72977, -73.9554603532783)",40.72977,-73.9554603532783

There’s another thing that should definitely be on that list: have dinner at Peter Luger Steak House. 
This Williamsburg spot has been around since 1887, and everything about it seems to be from a time when restaurants worried less about rising rents and more about prohibition agents. From the bow-tied bartender with slicked-back hair and a mustache, who fills tumblers of whiskey while people wait for their tables, to the regulars who order without looking at the menu, to servers saying “no credit cards” as they toss branded chocolate gold coins onto the table with the check - Peter Luger is an experience unlike any other you’ll find in the city. 
People who call this place kitschy aren’t too cool for Peter Luger. They’re just missing the point. Peter Luger is for everybody, and you can see that as soon as you look around at the crowd. Unlike the clientele at a lot of Manhattan steakhouses, which can feel like SuitSupply showrooms, Peter Luger draws everyone from tourists on their honeymoon taking pictures with the menu to groups who have been coming after every Jets win since 1969 to M&A teams talking about the deal they closed as though they just sacked Rome. And all of those people realize this place is an institution.The overall experience is the reason Peter Luger should be on your bucket list, but the food - generally, a barrage of red meat - will leave you hoping Deepak Chopra starts endorsing high-fat diets. Start with a couple sides of extra thick bacon, and then move on to the main attraction: the porterhouse. Old-school servers put thick slices of filet and sirloin on your plate, and then spoon juices from the meat and melted butter on top. It’s by far the best cut at Luger, and it belongs in any conversation about the best steaks in the city.
The sirloin and ribeye are prepared the same way as the porterhouse - dry-aged and cooked just with salt and butter - but they’re not as good on their own. That’s where the big gravy boats of Peter Luger Sauce come in handy. Between this steak sauce, which we’ve been putting on steak and chicken and pasta (and pretty much everything else) since we were old enough to open the fridge, and the pool of juices at the base of each plate of meat, there are no bad bites here. 
After you soak up all those pools of juices with onion bread, your server might suggest one more thing before bringing the hot fudge sundae: pick up the dry-aged t-bone in your hands and gnaw the last of the meat off the bone.

Zizi Limona looks like countless other casual restaurants nearby, with an interior heavy on wood and exposed brick, a small bar lined with wine bottles, and a couple of tables on the sidewalk outside. But unlike other unmemorable neighborhood spots where you’d only eat if Time Warner gave you a three-hour arrival window and you needed to stay close by, you’ll actually look forward to having a meal here.One reason why is that the food is really good. There’s a selection of small plates to start with - like crunchy little squares of falafel over curry yogurt, or a light, creamy hummus topped with a pool of olive oil - and you could easily make a meal out of just those, especially since they come with as much complimentary fresh pita as you want. But you should share some of the large plates as well. Our favorite is the shawarma: a huge portion of hummus, chickpeas, and charred onions topped with strips of spiced chicken and lamb, and some green tahini on top. Whether you’re with vegetarians or people who like getting multiple types of meat on a single plate, there are options for everyone. 
Plus, the environment works just as well for a casual dinner with your parents as it does for a first dinner date. You could come with a big group, or sit at the 10-seat bar and have a healthy solo meal while trying to figure out the deal with this playlist of Janet Jackson, M.I.A, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.

You pick one $27 entree like you’re going to ask for its hand in marriage, then spend the next 20 minutes trying not to look distracted while your friend reenacts her phone call with the cable company and you consider changing your order.
At Nonono, there’s no need to worry about pledging your eternal soul to the wrong thing, because you won’t be ordering just one dish. You’ll be ordering 10. This Japanese restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Her Name is Han and Take 31 (two Korean restaurants we really like) has a menu so huge and reasonably priced that you can basically get as much as you want, like you’re some prince or person with a credit card problem.If an LSAT study book were replaced with photographs of Japanese food, it would look a lot like the menu here. It comes in a little binder, and side effects of flipping through it include not listening to what anyone is saying to you and an intense urge to order too much food. There’s a lot to choose from - 40 or so yakitori skewers, plus everything from fried chicken and ramen to sushi - and almost nothing costs more than $15.
You’ll be tempted to get something from every section, and the good news is that you probably can - especially if you’re with a group. The yakitori skewers are mostly $3 or $4 each, and your options range from various chicken parts to beef, pork, fish, and vegetables (including an entire skewer of garlic). They’re seasoned and then cooked on a grill that you see as you walk in, and while these skewers are the main attraction, Nonono’s many other dishes are equally affordable and great for sharing. Some of our favorites are the tori liver pate with ginger and a rainbow sushi roll that comes with grated parmesan on top. Just be aware that the food will arrive at your table almost immediately, and pretty much all at the same time - so if you hate slow service, you’ll love it here, and if you get overwhelmed easily, consider ordering a little at a time.
If you wanted to try every single thing on Nonono’s menu, you’d have to make eating here your side hustle. And we fully endorse that.

This Japanese restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Her Name is Han and Take 31 (two Korean restaurants we really like) has a menu so huge and reasonably priced that you can basically get as much as you want, like you’re some prince or person with a credit card problem.If an LSAT study book were replaced with photographs of Japanese food, it would look a lot like the menu here. It comes in a little binder, and side effects of flipping through it include not listening to what anyone is saying to you and an intense urge to order too much food. There’s a lot to choose from - 40 or so yakitori skewers, plus everything from fried chicken and ramen to sushi - and almost nothing costs more than $15.
You’ll be tempted to get something from every section, and the good news is that you probably can - especially if you’re with a group. The yakitori skewers are mostly $3 or $4 each, and your options range from various chicken parts to beef, pork, fish, and vegetables (including an entire skewer of garlic). They’re seasoned and then cooked on a grill that you see as you walk in, and while these skewers are the main attraction, Nonono’s many other dishes are equally affordable and great for sharing. Some of our favorites are the tori liver pate with ginger and a rainbow sushi roll that comes with grated parmesan on top. Just be aware that the food will arrive at your table almost immediately, and pretty much all at the same time - so if you hate slow service, you’ll love it here, and if you get overwhelmed easily, consider ordering a little at a time.
If you wanted to try every single thing on Nonono’s menu, you’d have to make eating here your side hustle. And we fully endorse that. Instead of suffering from ordering anxiety, you’ll enjoy the thrill of trying lots of different, excellent things, every time. We’ll keep coming back to Nonono until that feeling gets old.","118 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10016",Manhattan,10016,point probably experienced ordering anxiety stare menu seven dish sound promising trying picture future want start forget read server come pick one 27 entree like going ask hand marriage spend next 2 minute trying look distracted friend reenacts phone call cable company consider changing order nonono need worry pledging eternal soul wrong thing ordering one dish ordering 1 japanese restaurant nomad people behind name han take 31 two korean restaurant really like menu huge reasonably priced basically get much want like prince person credit card problem lsat study book replaced photograph japanese food would look lot like menu come little binder side effect flipping include listening anyone saying intense urge order much food lot choose 4 yakitori skewer plus everything fried chicken ramen sushi almost nothing cost 15 tempted get something every section good news probably especially group yakitori skewer mostly 3 4 option range various chicken part beef pork fish vegetable including entire skewer garlic seasoned cooked grill see walk skewer main attraction nonono many dish equally affordable great sharing favorite torus liver pate ginger rainbow sushi roll come grated parmesan top aware food arrive table almost immediately pretty much time hate slow service love get overwhelmed easily consider ordering little time wanted try every single thing nonono menu make eating side hustle fully endorse instead suffering ordering anxiety enjoy thrill trying lot different excellent thing every time keep coming back nonono feeling get old,"(40.745401, -73.9848544)",40.745401,-73.9848544

They’re the kind of places that get 12-page Vanity Fair oral histories, and which go into the history books as neighborhood-defining and decade-describing. There’s Florent (1985-2008), which basically made the Meatpacking District a thing. There’s The Odeon (1980-present), which basically made Tribeca a thing, and where Andy Warhol and Basquiat hung out, and where a lot of celebrities apparently did drugs in the basement in the 80s. And there’s Balthazar (1997-present), which hit Soho in the middle of its transformation from a place artists lived to a place where tourists take pictures in front of a Prada store.
And now there’s Frenchette (born 2018), located just a few blocks up from The Odeon, operated by owners who worked at Balthazar when it opened. While it’s tough to say whether Frenchette will be talked about decades from now, this is definitely a downtown French bistro that’s emblematic of its time. Because rather than doing cocaine in a bathroom, people at Frenchette are discussing obscure natural wines from the Jura and eating blowfish tails.
Welcome to New York in 2018, where the food is delicious but pricey, and the wine has names like “Le Groll and Roll.”Frenchette’s food is a mix of modern and traditional French. Things definitely don’t veer into the fusion or experimental category at all, but you also won’t be eating a tuna tartare or an onion soup or a burger here. Instead, you’ll find dishes like escargots served with soft scrambled eggs or spaghetti with shaved bottarga or a tortilla espanola with trout roe. We’d recommend springing for the truly exceptional lobster, and going for the duck over the steak if you want something that involves frites. You should also be sure to try a few of the smaller “amuses,” or one of the rotating seafood appetizers listed on the left of the menu. These options get changed up seasonally, and the dishes we’ve had, like a little mortadella brioche sandwich or razor clams, have been great.
To go with your food, there’s the wine, which you should know a bit about before coming here. The list focuses on natural wines produced without sulfites, mostly from France, frequently involving obscure grape varieties, and as a result tends to require both some guidance and an open mind. If you’re used to ordering your go-to big Napa Cab or Chianti Classico, don’t expect to see anything like that on the long list here. On the other hand, if the words “funky” and “chilled red” are already in your wine vocabulary, you’ll be right at home.
Alternately, if you don’t know much about wine other than that you like it, just smile and nod when the server suggests something that sounds like “Pinot Denise” and wonder if that’s a wine label your aunt’s book club just started. The servers’ recs can lean pricey in our experience, so feel free to be firm in stating you don’t want to spend as much, because there are a handful of bottles under $60 too. Maybe you’ll discover you really enjoy these often light and tart wines, maybe you’ll think they taste like hay and kombucha.You should come to Frenchette for the food (and maybe the wine, but that’s going to have to be your call), but you’ll want to stay and come back because of the classic French bistro energy. It’s loud and crowded, but you definitely get that “yep, we’re in New York” feeling that very few places manage to nail. While Frenchette can quickly get expensive and feel like a scene, it never feels too formal. You might have people in suits on one side of you, people in jeans on the other, and someone wearing a designer cape elsewhere in the room.
Will there someday be a magazine feature about Frenchette? Probably not, and that’s partially because magazines won’t even exist.

On the surface, this tiny wine bar in the East Village is a bit of a sensory overload. The food is all cooked behind the bar in full view of everyone, which fills the narrow, 19-seat space with smells of toasting bread and frying bacon. This, coupled with a list of funky wines and some loud hip hop, is more than enough to keep you entertained if you’re just here to drink some wine without thinking too hard about it. And while you can certainly enjoy yourself having a drink and listening to Mobb Deep on the speakers, that’s only the first rung on the Ruffian ladder.
We’d recommend going at least a step further, by diving into the short food menu. There are usually about 10 items to choose from, most sized somewhere between an appetizer and an entree. You’ll find things like a corn soup with a curry base, and perfectly cooked octopus served over a rich, spicy mole - all of which are more interesting and delicious than you’d expect for a place whose kitchen basically consists of a guy behind the bar with a hot plate.The next step is to explore more of the huge, natural-wine-focused wine list. The over 250 options are almost all from small producers in southern and eastern Europe, but unlike other natural wine-focused spots that require you to have taken a Great Courses Plus on offbeat varietals and appellations, Ruffian categorizes their wines with terms that are actually helpful (or at least entertaining). So rosés are split into “Beach Sipping” and “Stoop Sipping,” red wines have categories like “Rootsy” or “Kool-Aid,” and Champagnes get labels like “Central Park” or “Tompkins Park.” You can tell your server you want to try a red wine from the “Bloody” section of the menu, and they’ll ask if you want something straightforward or “funky as f*ck” before telling you both are great and offering tastes of each.
Beyond the descriptors on the menu, Ruffian generally offers a more creative way to think about wine. For example, on a recent visit, the bartender told us that for the next few weeks, their wines by-the-glass would only be from locations mentioned in stories from The Odyssey, which led to some questionable recall of 11th grade English class as well as a discussion about orange wines from the Peloponnese.

My Cuban Spot, a takeout window in Gowanus, is a reminder that if a place serves excellent food, the rest of that stuff doesn’t really matter.
The options here mostly consist of rice bowls topped with beans and various meats and spices, plus Cuban sandwiches, all of which come on heavily-buttered, slightly-charred, pressed bread. The Cubano is made with slow-roasted pork that’s super rich, and every ingredient balances out to make this one of our favorite sandwiches in Brooklyn. But if you have any plans in the immediate future beyond watching Planet Earth slumped on your couch with your hand on your stomach, you can opt for a bowl instead without being disappointed - the “Oink Oink Babe” has the same juicy, rich, salty pork, but in a somewhat lighter format topped with a fantastic fried sweet plantain.Space-wise, this spot is just a window on the sidewalk. So after ordering, you can bring your food to one of two small tables or take it to-go. Which is fine, because you could eat these Cuban sandwiches and rice bowls in the aisle of a commuter train at 5pm on a summer Friday and you’d still enjoy them. Although you’d probably make the people around you pretty jealous.

My Cuban Spot, a takeout window in Gowanus, is a reminder that if a place serves excellent food, the rest of that stuff doesn’t really matter.
The options here mostly consist of rice bowls topped with beans and various meats and spices, plus Cuban sandwiches, all of which come on heavily-buttered, slightly-charred, pressed bread. The Cubano is made with slow-roasted pork that’s super rich, and every ingredient balances out to make this one of our favorite sandwiches in Brooklyn. But if you have any plans in the immediate future beyond watching Planet Earth slumped on your couch with your hand on your stomach, you can opt for a bowl instead without being disappointed - the “Oink Oink Babe” has the same juicy, rich, salty pork, but in a somewhat lighter format topped with a fantastic fried sweet plantain.Space-wise, this spot is just a window on the sidewalk. So after ordering, you can bring your food to one of two small tables or take it to-go. Which is fine, because you could eat these Cuban sandwiches and rice bowls in the aisle of a commuter train at 5pm on a summer Friday and you’d still enjoy them. Although you’d probably make the people around you pretty jealous. 
Nothing on the menu here costs more than $12, and even though the portions are large, you shouldn’t overlook sides like crispy empanadas filled with guava and cheese.

Luckily, at no point in life will you be too old for a meal that starts with croissants and ends with profiteroles, especially if everything in between consists of various ways to consume soft boiled eggs and aged Comté cheese. La Mercerie is a place where you come to eat French food done well - like your favorite bistro in Paris, but with less smoking. You can decide if that’s for better or worse.That said, your overall opinion of La Mercerie will likely depend less on how you feel about cigarettes and more about something else - how you feel about being around things you can’t have.
Do you like to window shop on Madison Avenue even though you’re also still hanging onto a sandwich from Monday in your refrigerator? Are you happily married but also still secretly keeping screenshots of Armie Hammer in your camera roll? La Mercerie is a place you’ll probably enjoy.
But if you’re the kind of person that would prefer to avoid coming face to face with the fact that you will never own a $25,000 couch, you might have different feelings.

In 2009, the restaurant left NYC for San Francisco, where it also became very popular, before finally returning to NYC in 2018 and settling into the Lower East Side. The restaurant in its current iteration is co-run with the people behind nearby Wildair and Contra, and they’re responsible for the small plates and desserts, as well as the wine.The pizza part of the menu is very short, and the options are basically all permutations of mozzarella and tomato - there’s a margherita, a marinara, a white pie, and one with egg and salami that’s only available on Saturdays. The crust is light and chewy, and gooey in the middle in a good way. It’s true Neapolitan pizza that absolutely should be eaten with a knife and fork, starting from the middle. Contradicting the fact that food always tastes better when eaten with your hands, cutting into the center here rather than picking it up really does make it taste better.
How completely into this pizza you’ll be is going to depend somewhat on your personal taste - if you like classic, extremely simple Neapolitan pies, you’ll really like what they do here. Those first few bites into the center in particular produced that “oh, this is good, I need to have a moment with this pizza” face that great pies have. And they’d better, because these pizzas cost $25 each, which, simply put, is a lot for a margherita pizza.Beyond pizza, this comeback tour has picked up a pretty cool opening act with appetizers and desserts from the Wildair team, and they’re a big part of a meal here, though they feel somewhat randomly paired with the pizza. If you’re going to get one starter, make sure it’s the beef crudo with cheese, pistachio, and olives, which is like a pleasurable punch in the face. Others, like a lobster crudo or white asparagus dish, are very tasty, but they also feel a little delicate (they’re very small) as a precursor to the pizza. It would be sort of like having Bob Dylan open for Van Halen. Cool idea, even if the energy feels a little off. If you’re budgeting costs or stomach space, we’d instead suggest you put your resources towards dessert, because the options on that front are all fantastic. The ice cream, as well as the tiramisu and panna cotta, are unique takes that we can comfortably say are the best thing here.
Una Pizza Napoletana is a restaurant with a lot of great (though pricey) component parts - the small plates, pizzas, and desserts are all really good. And the space is pretty neutral, like it could be a nice art museum cafe. So think of it this way: a strong comeback tour show, in a nice but unremarkable venue, with a slightly mismatched but also very good opener who killed it on that last song.",2.0,Pizza,Una Pizza Napoletana,8.1,"Comeback tours always feel exciting. Whether it’s the Spice Girls performing at the Olympics Opening Ceremonies almost two decades after their peak or Fleetwood Mac reuniting for the 18th time, these shows are a chance to relive the past, or to see what you might have missed the first time around. Of course, tickets might be expensive, and there’s the worry that they’ll play too much new stuff, but hey, it’s Stevie Nicks.

We also wish there were more new restaurants that genuinely surprised us. Not by flambeeing dishes tableside or by sabering bottles of vintage champagne, but with subtlety. Places where you notice new, unexpected things each time you visit. Basically, we wish we had more places like Davelle.
Davelle is an all-day Japanese restaurant that’s about the size of a studio apartment you’d find in this part of the Lower East Side. There are three small tables and eight seats at a bar, which shifts from serving coffee to wine and sake as the day goes on. Like the one-room space, the food seems fairly straightforward at first glance. But sit down here for dinner, and you’ll find that every dish is packed with intense, unusual flavors that make you think through your food vocabulary like those kids on stage at the national spelling bee.It’s hard to believe that one or two people cooking in such a small space produce such a varied menu, ranging from small plates like tender, lemony fried chicken to entrees like rich, smoky pork curry to a number of Japanese spaghetti dishes unlike anything else you’ll find in New York. One is cooked in ketchup and soy sauce (a combo that’s popular in Japan and works impressively well), and another is topped with so much uni that eating it feels like when a wave knocks you down and rolls you along the ocean floor, but without the whole losing your bathing suit thing. And these dishes only make up half the menu.
Davelle also specializes in oden, comprised of small bowls of dashi broth with your choice of ingredients like daikon or fried octopus. They’re all about $4 and are a nice, light complement or alternative to the intensely-flavored entrees. The broth is held in what looks like an espresso machine on the bar, and it constantly changes as it simmers and new ingredients are added. So not only is the food here different from just about every other spot around, but order the same oden here two days in a row, and the flavors will be different each time.We’d understand if such a small spot making this quality and variety of food treated everything else as an afterthought, but the surprises here go beyond the food. The wine list, for example, only has about 10 options, but all of them are natural wines under $60, including a couple pet-nats (lightly sparkling, cloudy-looking wines that are often pretty funky). To devote a quarter of an already tiny wine list to a polarizing style that lots of people have never heard of is just one of the unexpected details that make this place special and different.
The acoustics are a mix of Marvin Gaye, Ray Charles, and stories from the chef/owner about growing up in Hokkaido.

But now that you have a bank account and fewer favorite dinosaurs, people just expect you to be impressive on a daily basis. Such is life as an adult - and, if Legacy Records were a person, it would probably relate.
Legacy Records is the latest place from the people behind Charlie Bird and Pasquale Jones, two of our favorite restaurants in the city. Unlike those downtown spots, however, this place is in a fancy new condo building in Hudson Yards, a neighborhood that’s about one RoboCop away from feeling dystopian. The restaurant itself is huge and expensive-looking, and, much like a fully-grown person with a job and a phone bill, it inspires certain expectations. As long as you’re willing to spend some money, however, Legacy Records will easily meet them.
The menu here is similar to what you’ll find at Charlie Bird and other places that want to be like Charlie Bird, which is to say: pasta, crudo, duck, and steak. If that sounds boring, that’s because it usually is - but when the formula is this well-executed, it’s hard to complain. The roasted duck is one of the best dishes made from that bird in the city, the pastas are more complex than what you’ll find at most Italian restaurants, and the crudo sampler will make you feel like you’re at a dinner party hosted by Poseidon. It comes with five different types of raw seafood like scallop and tuna belly, and it’s one of the better ways to spend $25 on yourself.As for the space, it’s opulent. The floors are a mix of tile and hardwood, there’s a horseshoe bar that looks like it belongs on a 100-foot yacht, and the tables are all topped with leather - which, apparently, is something that you can do with tables. The ceilings are also so high it’ll make you want to Google the cost of vertical real estate, and the green-and-gold color scheme has a vaguely country-club-designed-by-Wes-Anderson feel to it. Despite all of this, however, Legacy Records isn’t quiet or stuffy. 
The service is friendly, the old-school hip hop soundtrack is louder than you expect from a place where you can buy a magnum of vintage Krug, and the host won’t check to see what kind of shoes you’re wearing. And, in that sense, this place has retained a lot of the DNA of its downtown predecessors. The only real difference is: it isn’t as small or charming, and all the little extras like the excellent wine list feel less surprising.

The ceilings are also so high it’ll make you want to Google the cost of vertical real estate, and the green-and-gold color scheme has a vaguely country-club-designed-by-Wes-Anderson feel to it. Despite all of this, however, Legacy Records isn’t quiet or stuffy. 
The service is friendly, the old-school hip hop soundtrack is louder than you expect from a place where you can buy a magnum of vintage Krug, and the host won’t check to see what kind of shoes you’re wearing. And, in that sense, this place has retained a lot of the DNA of its downtown predecessors. The only real difference is: it isn’t as small or charming, and all the little extras like the excellent wine list feel less surprising.

One circle represents all the places to drink good wine in New York City. It’s a big-ass circle, full of natural wine bars, white tablecloth restaurants, and your apartment when someone brings over a bottle that costs more than $12. The other circle has all the places to drink outside in the summer, filled with rooftops, boats, beer gardens, and patios. As for the middle part of this diagram, where good wine and good outdoor space overlap - it’s pretty tiny. But at least there’s City Vineyard. 
City Vineyard is a two-floor restaurant and wine bar on the Hudson River in Tribeca. You could technically have dinner in the indoor dining room, but we’d suggest you skip that in favor of the massive roof deck. Both it and the ground-floor wine garden are big enough to fit everyone in your office Slack channel on Summer Fridays, and it’s walking distance from FiDi, Soho, Tribeca, and the West Village. More importantly, it has panoramic views of downtown Manhattan and the river. 
Those views are great, but the wine is what really separates City Vineyard from every other giant outdoor bar that serves $18 glasses of sparkling rosé and cocktails that look like they glow in the dark. The 30-page wine list at City Vineyard would be worth a trip even without the ’80s hip-hop on the speakers and the sunsets over the water.This place is an offshoot of City Winery, a bar nearby that makes its own wines, many of which are served on tap at City Vineyard. Since they don’t have to spend money bottling or labeling, and the wines last months rather than hours, you can get fresh, consistent riesling and pinot noir on tap here at relatively affordable prices. The rest of the huge wine list has famous and unusual options from all over the world - but City Vineyard doesn’t take itself too seriously. Nobody here will roll their eyes if you ask for some seltzer and turn your Sancerre into a spritz.
You’ll be happy enough with some seafood share plates like baked clams and calamari on your table, and maybe after that fourth flight of house wines, get the burger with gruyere. If you’ve never chased oysters with Muscadet, City Vineyard would also be a good place to change that.
Can you get better bar food at other places around the city? Absolutely. But you don’t come here for the food. You come to City Vineyard because you want to have good wine outside, and you don’t want to drink Barolo out of solo cups in the park or nearly frozen Pinot Grigio on crowded hotel rooftops.

We will say that if you’ve eaten here many times over the years, or if you eat in a lot of seasonal Italian restaurants, you might not be as excited about Barbuto as you were a few years back.

In both situations, you’re out on the open ocean getting sunshine and not catching fish.

The experience is more fun when it’s casual and low-commitment, and we feel the same way about The Spaniard.
The Spaniard is a bar on a busy stretch in the West Village with an extensive cocktail menu and over 100 types of whiskey.

While the food is probably better than it is at that sports bar, it’s also considerably more expensive. Overall, you’ll have a better time if you use The Spaniard as a bar rather than a restaurant.

The Spaniard, though, is a multi-room space that never gets too loud or dark, where you can comfortably speak with friends or even try to move beyond your “no new friends” policy. 
But the crowds that make this a fun spot to get drinks also make eating a full meal here a fairly unpleasant experience.

Bamonte’s, an Italian restaurant in Williamsburg that opened in 1900, might not be a globally-recognized icon, but it’s still an essential New York institution. If John D. Rockefeller has an oyster dish named after him, so should Pasquale Bamonte.
This red-sauce Italian spot has been in the same space in Williamsburg since the beginning of the last century. The dining room hasn’t been updated since the ’50s, and the space is still filled with tuxedo-wearing servers who bring family-style plates of baked ziti and pork chop parmesan to big tables of people. If you haven’t been part of one of those big tables of people, it’s time you made it into this classic establishment.
The fact that this place hasn’t changed at all - despite Williamsburg’s transformation around it - makes eating here that much more special. The space still has old phone booths, the walls are covered in pictures of the pope and signed portraits of celebrities, and the house bread comes with foil-wrapped butter packets. When your server opens the wine and fills your glass to the brim, you may have flashbacks to your first visit to the city - when you went into a spot in Little Italy with a street sign out front that said “Best Italian Food in New York”, and you ended up spending two hours eating mediocre cannolis and listening to the owner’s daughter sing ""These Boots Are Made For Walkin'"". But Bamonte’s isn’t sticking to its traditions as a gimmick.

Bamonte’s, an Italian restaurant in Williamsburg that opened in 1900, might not be a globally-recognized icon, but it’s still an essential New York institution. If John D. Rockefeller has an oyster dish named after him, so should Pasquale Bamonte.
This red-sauce Italian spot has been in the same space in Williamsburg since the beginning of the last century. The dining room hasn’t been updated since the ’50s, and the space is still filled with tuxedo-wearing servers who bring family-style plates of baked ziti and pork chop parmesan to big tables of people. If you haven’t been part of one of those big tables of people, it’s time you made it into this classic establishment.
The fact that this place hasn’t changed at all - despite Williamsburg’s transformation around it - makes eating here that much more special. The space still has old phone booths, the walls are covered in pictures of the pope and signed portraits of celebrities, and the house bread comes with foil-wrapped butter packets. When your server opens the wine and fills your glass to the brim, you may have flashbacks to your first visit to the city - when you went into a spot in Little Italy with a street sign out front that said “Best Italian Food in New York”, and you ended up spending two hours eating mediocre cannolis and listening to the owner’s daughter sing ""These Boots Are Made For Walkin'"".

There are two separate bar areas - one where they make colorful cocktails, and a bread bar with a few counter seats overlooking a big wood-burning oven painted like a tiger.

In order to get into Reynard, you’ll have to walk past groups of guys waiting for the doorman to let them up to the rooftop bar, and then you’ll have to pass through the tourist-filled lobby.

Maybe everyone called you “Sara’s sister, right?” when you showed up to ninth grade, or maybe you were known as “little Mike” to all the older kids. It was annoying, most likely. 
I personally am a tyrannical older sibling, so I can’t relate to this. But Fausto can.
Fausto, first of all, is located in the space formerly occupied by Franny’s. And second, it’s run by a former owner and chef from L’Artusi. If you’re unfamiliar, Franny’s was a beloved restaurant that made great pizzas, but was best known for being everyone’s favorite place in Park Slope from 2003 until it closed at the end of 2017. It was a quintessential Brooklyn restaurant, and one of the first places in this part of Brooklyn that people from all over the city traveled to. L’Artusi, meanwhile, has a 9.5 rating from us, and is really a place you should go tonight if you haven’t been. So for at least a while, Fausto is likely to be referred to by many as “the new Franny’s” or “the place from the L’Artusi people,” if not both combined.And it does share some things in common with those places, falling somewhere in the middle of the two. It’s more dressed up than Franny’s, which was more of a neighborhood spot, and there are no pizzas, though they still make plenty of use of the wood-burning oven. At the same time, it’s more casual than L’Artusi, but they do have a similarly extensive list of pastas.
But if you can leave its cool older siblings behind, Fausto is best considered on its own. As a very good, modern Italian restaurant. The menu is filled with things you’ll want to eat, like a snapper crudo, meatballs, orechiette with pork, a simple fusilli with tomato sauce, a roast chicken, and a lamb chop. All of it is well-executed, and very enjoyable. Yes, you can eat similar dishes at other high-end, modern Italian places around the city and country, but if there were a loyalty program for tagliatelle ragu and little gem salads, we’d enroll, so no complaints there. Additionally, the service is notably friendly and welcoming, and the wine list and cocktails are excellent.Fausto is a great choice for a night out that falls somewhere between “random Friday date night” and special occasion. Stop by and have a cocktail and a bowl of pasta at the bar to celebrate a small victory, like finishing a big project at work, or finding the Apple TV remote after three months.

Williamsburg was cool, its residents were called “hipsters,” other people liked to talk about their mustaches and fixed-gears, and a neighborhood steakhouse called St. Anselm opened with a signature steak that cost $15.
Fast forward to now. That steak is $24, Williamsburg is objectively not cool, and mustaches are just mustaches. But St. Anselm is still one of the greatest places to eat a steak in New York City.
That is, if you can get in. It’s a narrow room with maybe eight tables and a long row of seats overlooking the open kitchen, where you can watch your two-pound ax handle being showered with salt and cooked on an open grill. The room is covered in brick and wood, and makes you feel a little bit like a medieval knight in a cabin upstate. There are no reservations, and if you don’t show up before 7pm - especially on weekends - you will likely end up needing a new dinner plan. 
But St. Anselm is worth the effort of arriving early, explaining to your visitors why you’re waiting two hours for steak and mashed potatoes, and getting drunk while you wait for your table (in the backyard of Spuyten Duyvil next door if it’s summer, or at the wine bar Have & Meyer in the winter).If there are only two of you, or if you want a Hall of Fame solo meal, you should request counter seats. St. Anselm feels different from every other steakhouse in large part because the cooking is all out in the open. You don’t have to be someone who uses your kitchen to want to figure out how these people make your steak taste this good.
We suspect it has a lot to do with butter and salt. We’re not totally sure what they do it, but we are sure that you should be ordering the butchers steak, every time. Have they raised the price every year? Yes. Is it still the best steak at St. Anselm? Yes. Even over the more expensive ones? 100%. Feel free to add on other meats, and the mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach and pretty much any other side that appeals, and the chocolate pot de creme for dessert. But the butchers steak is the thing we come back for.
But really, we come back to St. Anselm because there’s no other restaurant like it. In a city where you can find a duplicate, or at least a really good substitute, for just about every spot, there isn’t one for St. Anselm.

You’re deep in anticipation, taking stock of every detail, seeking out clues to indicate whether you might be chosen. Of course, at this Upper East Side sushi bar, you’re not waiting to find out if you got picked to have dodgeballs pelted at you on a basketball court. You’re waiting to see if a piece of sushi covered in gold flakes is going to be placed in front of you, or handed off to the guy a few seats down. That guy probably loves dodgeball.
At many good sushi bars, you’ll watch with some anticipation as pieces of yellowtail get topped with jalapeño and as pieces of fatty tuna are seared with a blowtorch. Maybe you’ll see some ocean trout get sprinkled with citrus salt, or some sea urchin paired with wagyu beef, as seems to be a trend these days. But at Sushi Ishikawa, you’ll see a bit more than that.
The creations here involve everything from truffles to caviar to gold leaf, sometimes all at once. And by the time you’ve watched a chef blowtorch a piece of fish, reach into a bunch of different containers, and fastidiously place one or more toppings on a piece of sushi, you’re really going to hope it’s yours. Omakase is the only option here, and each set of diners seems to get a somewhat different selection of pieces, which keeps things exciting and interesting. And just ever so slightly competitive.

That said, as the meal progressed, we also found ourselves getting fatigued at times by the excess of flavors going on in some pieces. Did that blowtorched piece of fish also need truffle shavings? Did that handroll also need little rice puffs? This is not a sushi place for purists.
It is, however, a lively, enjoyable place to have a meal, with overall tasty and unusual sushi, available at a price point that’s lower than many similar spots. You can either order 12 courses for $85, or 15 courses for $125 - both options involve primarily sushi, with a few small plates mixed in. It’s certainly not affordable, but given the long list of high-end sushi places that start their menus at $150 and up, it’s a better deal than many others.

It would start with the usual talking points of water quality in the city and diner culture in Jersey, and devolve into a shouting match over the cost of living and who gets to claim Frank Sinatra.
We simply want to talk about one pizza place in New Jersey. If you insist on comparing it to similar spots in New York, then fine - Razza is better than just about all of them. But it’s not useful to put Razza in the context of restaurants across the river, because it’s not like any of them, largely due to a focus on ingredients from its home state.
Razza is a wood-fired pizza spot across the street from City Hall in Jersey City, two stops on the Path train and about five minutes from Manhattan. A chalkboard in the middle of the industrial-looking dining room illustrates where they source ingredients - heirloom tomatoes, wild yeast and flour for the dough, mozzarella and ricotta - all from The Garden State. Yes, somewhere between the shore you’ve seen on a terrible TV show and the turnpike you know from the opening credits of a great TV show, there are water buffaloes and farms with some of the best produce in the country.The pizza at Razza has thin, springy crust and light, but excellent toppings. People who enjoy meat lovers’ pies or pools of melted cheese will probably find them a bit subtle. But if the idea of simple and high-quality toppings based on ingredients currently in-season sounds good to you, then we’d recommend making a trip to Razza as soon as possible. Try a pizza like the Project Hazelnut, which features housemade mozzarella and ricotta, honey, and hazelnuts from Rutgers’ Agricultural Experiment Station. Because tasking your state university with breeding nuts only grown in the Pacific Northwest is just the New Jersey way.
But if the toppings here are The E Street Band, then Razza’s pizza crust is The Boss. The base is very thin, but unlike fork-and-knife pies with soupy centers, each slice at Razza extends straight out when you pick it up. The outer rim gets charred in the wood-burning oven in the open kitchen, but it’s still fluffy and salty underneath the crisp outside. Eating this made us feel how the people at The Stone Pony probably felt when they saw Bruce on-stage as a teenager - we can’t explain how it’s done, but we know we’re experiencing something special.
Even without the pizzas and freshly made cheeses, we would come to Razza just for the bread and butter. Yes, the bread and butter. They’re fermented and made in-house every day, and just another example of the way Razza makes the simple into something exceptional.
If you’re a New Yorker in need of a reason to visit New Jersey beyond Giants games and trips to the airport, now you have it.

Yes, somewhere between the shore you’ve seen on a terrible TV show and the turnpike you know from the opening credits of a great TV show, there are water buffaloes and farms with some of the best produce in the country.The pizza at Razza has thin, springy crust and light, but excellent toppings. People who enjoy meat lovers’ pies or pools of melted cheese will probably find them a bit subtle. But if the idea of simple and high-quality toppings based on ingredients currently in-season sounds good to you, then we’d recommend making a trip to Razza as soon as possible. Try a pizza like the Project Hazelnut, which features housemade mozzarella and ricotta, honey, and hazelnuts from Rutgers’ Agricultural Experiment Station. Because tasking your state university with breeding nuts only grown in the Pacific Northwest is just the New Jersey way.
But if the toppings here are The E Street Band, then Razza’s pizza crust is The Boss. The base is very thin, but unlike fork-and-knife pies with soupy centers, each slice at Razza extends straight out when you pick it up. The outer rim gets charred in the wood-burning oven in the open kitchen, but it’s still fluffy and salty underneath the crisp outside. Eating this made us feel how the people at The Stone Pony probably felt when they saw Bruce on-stage as a teenager - we can’t explain how it’s done, but we know we’re experiencing something special.
Even without the pizzas and freshly made cheeses, we would come to Razza just for the bread and butter. Yes, the bread and butter. They’re fermented and made in-house every day, and just another example of the way Razza makes the simple into something exceptional.
If you’re a New Yorker in need of a reason to visit New Jersey beyond Giants games and trips to the airport, now you have it. Razza is just further proof of what George Washington knew a long time ago - crossing the river can lead to great things.

Most of the food here is generally enjoyable, so it’s easy to leave feeling full without racking up a bill that makes asking for the check even more uncomfortable than it’s already going to be.

Sure, there were tons of amazing restaurants opening up in the city at that time, but for a one-stop shop that captured what eating in the East Village was all about, Ssäm Bar was a pretty great bet. There were interesting things to eat, no reservations, uncomfortable seats, and a lot of pork belly. Remember how excited people used to get about bacon?
Now that we’ve gone on this trip down memory lane together, we’re going to suggest you close the history book, and store all that information in some overstuffed cabinet of your brain. Because Momofuku Ssam Bar is a pretty different restaurant now, and it’s best enjoyed if you can think about it that way.
While the restaurant overall looks similar, has the same name, and still serves a few of the same dishes, the place has evolved. For one, they take reservations (which aren’t too hard to get), and they’ve gotten rid of the uncomfortable stools. But more importantly, the menu has changed pretty significantly - where this was once a place you would only want to take people ready to go ham on some ham, menu highlights now include things like a scallop crudo and a piece of roasted skate and potatoes and burrata with garam masala. Yes, there are steaks and ribs and plenty of opportunities to make your body hurt in the morning, but overall there are more options to eat a bit lighter. Fortunately, this food is still very, very good. And much of it is also inventive, exciting, and different.They continue to serve the most iconic dishes - the pork buns and spicy rice cakes - but they’re technically off-menu. They’re still tasty and deeply satisfying, but they’re also a bit like watching reruns of Friends night after night, when you have access to an HBO Go password. They serve pork buns at the food hall in the United terminal in Newark now, you know?
If you’ve never been to Ssäm Bar then sure, get some pork buns and spicy rice cakes. But with so many Momofuku imitators around the world (and just actual other Momofuku restaurants around the world), we’d encourage coming here to try some of the newer stuff. Is it as trailblazing as it once was? Not quite. But it’s still doing stuff that feels fresh, and which tastes overall very good. These days, when an out-of-towner asks us where they should be eating, we’d have a long list to send them.

Sure, there were tons of amazing restaurants opening up in the city at that time, but for a one-stop shop that captured what eating in the East Village was all about, Ssäm Bar was a pretty great bet. There were interesting things to eat, no reservations, uncomfortable seats, and a lot of pork belly. Remember how excited people used to get about bacon?
Now that we’ve gone on this trip down memory lane together, we’re going to suggest you close the history book, and store all that information in some overstuffed cabinet of your brain. Because Momofuku Ssam Bar is a pretty different restaurant now, and it’s best enjoyed if you can think about it that way.
While the restaurant overall looks similar, has the same name, and still serves a few of the same dishes, the place has evolved. For one, they take reservations (which aren’t too hard to get), and they’ve gotten rid of the uncomfortable stools. But more importantly, the menu has changed pretty significantly - where this was once a place you would only want to take people ready to go ham on some ham, menu highlights now include things like a scallop crudo and a piece of roasted skate and potatoes and burrata with garam masala. Yes, there are steaks and ribs and plenty of opportunities to make your body hurt in the morning, but overall there are more options to eat a bit lighter. Fortunately, this food is still very, very good. And much of it is also inventive, exciting, and different.They continue to serve the most iconic dishes - the pork buns and spicy rice cakes - but they’re technically off-menu. They’re still tasty and deeply satisfying, but they’re also a bit like watching reruns of Friends night after night, when you have access to an HBO Go password. They serve pork buns at the food hall in the United terminal in Newark now, you know?
If you’ve never been to Ssäm Bar then sure, get some pork buns and spicy rice cakes. But with so many Momofuku imitators around the world (and just actual other Momofuku restaurants around the world), we’d encourage coming here to try some of the newer stuff. Is it as trailblazing as it once was? Not quite. But it’s still doing stuff that feels fresh, and which tastes overall very good. These days, when an out-of-towner asks us where they should be eating, we’d have a long list to send them. But we’d work Ssäm Bar in there somewhere.","207 2nd Ave., New York, NY 10003",Manhattan,10003,solid year 2 8 2 11 towner asked u eating new york easy go answer momofuku s bar sure ton amazing restaurant opening city time one stop shop captured eating east village s bar pretty great bet interesting thing eat reservation uncomfortable seat lot pork belly remember excited people used get bacon gone trip memory lane together going suggest close history book store information overstuffed cabinet brain momofuku ssam bar pretty different restaurant best enjoyed think way restaurant overall look similar name still serf dish place evolved one take reservation hard get gotten rid uncomfortable stool importantly menu changed pretty significantly place would want take people ready go ham ham menu highlight include thing like scallop crudo piece roasted skate potato burrata garam masala yes steak rib plenty opportunity make body hurt morning overall option eat bit lighter fortunately food still good much also inventive exciting different continue serve iconic dish pork bun spicy rice cake technically menu still tasty deeply satisfying also bit like watching rerun friend night night access hbo go password serve pork bun food hall united terminal newark know never s bar sure get pork bun spicy rice cake many momofuku imitator around world actual momofuku restaurant around world encourage coming try newer stuff trailblazing quite still stuff feel fresh taste overall good day towner asks u eating long list send work s bar somewhere,"(40.7316511, -73.985715)",40.7316511,-73.985715

Regardless of the value of making a canoe before hopping in a helicopter to get to the next set location, we can’t argue with the results.

But you also don’t need to be vegan to enjoy the food at Modern Love, a cool spot where dinner won’t feel like a compromise for anyone. 
Modern Love’s name might make you think it’s the kind of place where servers say namaste as they bring you grain bowls, or that it’s a takeout spot that sells bags of ashwagandha for $13. That is not the case. It’s a modern space with high ceilings and industrial chandeliers, and we’ve had to wait for a table each time we’ve shown up without a reservation. Also, don’t come here expecting plates of micro greens on macro greens - the food here is as heavy as you’ll find at most comfort-food places around the city.The menu is made up of vegan takes on classic comfort foods from around the world - they serve BBQ cauliflower wings and mac and cheese, but also stuff like arancini, fish and chips, and our favorite dish, the Caribbean jerk tofu. It comes with strips of spicy tofu, plantains, and coconut rice in a pool of curry, and whether you forage for ramps in the McCarren Park Farmer’s Market or you never pass up veal sweetbreads on any restaurant menu, you’re going to want to eat this.
That said, there are definitely a few places on the menu where it’s obvious there’s no butter or cheese. If you’re not used to bacon cheeseburgers that have bacon and cheese and burger, then you’ll probably enjoy the version here. We are used to those things, though, and we’d rather eat an actual bacon cheeseburger and a poutine with real gravy. Either way, we’d advise you commit to trying the more interesting items on the menu for best success.

If getting your roommate to pay you back for the last eight packages of toilet paper was easy, you wouldn’t need Venmo. And if there were places like Huertas around to solve every dinner problem, you wouldn’t need us. 
But there aren’t a lot of places like Huertas. Which is why I have a job, and why you need to know that this restaurant could very well be the answer to your group dinner plans.
Huertas feels like a place you’d find in another city. A city where you don’t encounter two-hour waits for tables, and where you can actually move your elbows without touching a stranger during your meal. For the East Village especially, this place is big - with a full bar area, two giant booths overlooking the open kitchen, and a back dining room. Same-day reservations are often available, and you shouldn’t have to wait too long if you’re walking in - it gets busy, but not slammed. 
While “we can actually get in” and “we can actually be comfortable” and “we can sit in a booth” are compelling reasons to eat at a restaurant, the food at Huertas also makes it a great spot for a group dinner. From the classic patatas bravas to the saffron rice with shrimp and bacon to the octopus, all of the Spanish share plates here are delicious, satisfying, and most importantly, big enough that you can actually share them. Although you might want to get two of the off-menu hot dogs. No one wants less than half a hot dog.The one section of the menu that might require doubling up is the pinxtos (Basque-style bites), which are ordered individually. Or, just order the Pinxto Me, which gets you all six. There’s also a full section of conservas, or seafood tins, which are a fun addition if your group can get down with things like black anchovies with quail egg or sardines and radishes.
Depending on how much you like the group you’re eating with, you might wish that one of you had an apartment big enough (and cooking skills good enough) that you could all just sit around in someone’s living room, instead of in a restaurant. But that’s another reason we like Huerta’s so much for this situation - you can tell they actually care that you have a good experience. The servers are genuinely friendly, the cocktails are great (we like the refrescos, which you could drink for hours and not be extremely hungover for your 9am tomorrow), and they do things like half-off all pinxtos on Tuesday nights. Plus, tipping is included, which makes the decision to just split your check into six credit cards that much simpler.
You should come to Huerta’s when you’re looking for a neighborhood spot that’ll make it easy for you to just hang with your friends, instead of worrying whether you ordered enough food or whether your glass of wine is actually going to ever make it to the table.

Mine was at a convenience store in Iceland. I’m pretty sure that the tomato sauce was actually ketchup, topped with whole sticks of string cheese. It was disgusting, and I also finished it, which was in part connected to having drunk several Smirnoff Ices, which was a very popular beverage in Iceland 10 years ago.
Now think of the best pizza you’ve had in your life. Mine was at a place by the water in Naples, Italy. Did the perfect weather, the views of the Mediterranean, and general sense of being in the pizza capital of the world add a certain something? Definitely. But this pizza was also just really, really amazing. The tomatoes and mozzarella tasted like they had been carried over to the restaurant about five minutes prior, and melded together in a way I have not experienced before or since. I’m not sharing this tale of food in a foreign country to suddenly go all Travel Channel on you. I’m sharing it because it’s relevant, as this very same pizza place, Gino Sorbillo, now has a location in New York, on Bowery and 2nd Street.Is the pizza on Bowery as good as it was in Naples? Of course not. But it’s still some of the better Neapolitan pizza in NYC. If you’ve tried Paulie Gee’s, Roberta’s, Motorino, Kesté, and so on, and generally thought they were all great, then we think you’ll find that Sorbillo can fairly join those ranks, pizza-wise. The ingredients are fresh and of the highest quality, and as in Italy, they all meld together to make that ideal tomato and cheese soup in the middle. It should also be noted that pies here are softer in the center than most other NYC Neapolitan pizzas, and really need to be eaten with a fork and knife. We know it’s against the New York rules, but just go with it here.
Those pizzas come in a dozen or so varieties, mostly of the traditional-ish nature - expect toppings like anchovies or prosciutto, not brussels sprouts or cherries or spicy honey. There’s a menu of pastas and salads and meatballs as well, which are good but also pretty similar to what you’ll find in every other East Village Italian restaurant. You’re here for pizza.The idea that you’re really just here for the pizza is further reflected in the restaurant’s perfectly nice but not-particularly-awesome-feeling interior. It’s a big, clean space with brick walls, a bar, some assorted Italian affects, and a huge, definitely unnecessary mural that says Gino Sorbillo, in case you forgot what restaurant you’re in. It would be ideal for an affordable dinner with your team from work or a casual midweek dinner or something along those lines, but it’s not as charming as our favorite Brooklyn pizza spots, or some of our other favorite East Village Italian restaurants.

We have to believe someone’s been to the new Nobu - a family of rich foreign tourists, or a few members of the fixed income desk at Deutsche Bank, maybe - but it’s not much of a hot spot. Which means there was an opening for an actually kind of cool, slightly sceney Japanese restaurant in Tribeca. And that’s where Tetsu comes in.Tetsu is the downtown, more casual, a la carte restaurant from the chef behind Masa, the $600-a-head restaurant in Columbus Circle, but it can also just be thought of as New Nobu. Located behind an inconspicuous door on Leonard Street, Tetsu is, like Nobu, a dark, trendy Tribeca restaurant with Japanese food that tastes pretty good and costs a bit too much.
The menu has plenty of options, from salads, to skewers, to cooked plates, to sushi in both nigiri and handroll form. If you come hungry, we’d recommend getting some of the bigger dishes like ribs or steak plus some salads, which are enjoyable and nicely sized. Definitely supplement with some sushi, but don’t expect it to be the core of your meal, as each piece of nigiri or handroll needs to be ordered individually. If you want to spend over $100 on a sushi meal in New York City, there are better ways to go about it.Seating comes in a few forms. If you’re a group, you’ll end up in the back, possibly at a communal table, or in the upstairs “mezzanine area.” These are both fine options, but we prefer one of the two long, nicely-lit bars. You can reserve seats at the back one, while the front one is for walk-ins - and as long as it’s not a Saturday night at 8pm, you should be able to find a seat up there. In fact, this is probably the best way to check out Tetsu - for a drink (they do great cocktails) and a few bites at the bar.

And you’ll also never find a post office that doesn’t make you feel a deep and disorientating sadness - like when you see a whole ice cream cone on the ground, or go into a Best Buy and accidentally catch the last few minutes of The Notebook on a 65-inch flat screen. And, if you live here, you also know that it’s hard to walk into a good restaurant without a reservation on a Friday night. Sauvage, however, is an exception.
We’ve never had too much trouble getting into Sauvage. Which is weird, because this restaurant in lower Greenpoint has a lot going for it. It’s casual enough that you can wear a sweater that you’ve technically never washed before, the food is both reliably good and just a little bit interesting, and it’s one of the most pleasant places to have a meal within a two-mile radius.
It feels like a newer version of one of the bistros you see on every corner in Paris. There are red leather banquettes, a few potted plants, and some old-school ceiling fans that are probably just for show. Also, when it’s nice out, you can sit at one of the many tables on the sidewalk, eat a decent brunch, and watch the tourists wandering up Bedford Ave (some of whom are probably from Paris, which makes for a nice role reversal).Despite the name, however, the food at Sauvage is only vaguely French, and, for a place where you can eat crudités with “cloumage and Louis dressing,” it’s surprisingly unpretentious. The burrata, for example, is just piled on a plate with squash and pancetta. It’s an interesting (and successful) combination, and you’ll make a mental note to try it again. As for the mains, we wouldn’t say they’re anything groundbreaking - but the pastas are great for a place that isn’t Italian, they know how to cook a piece of duck, and the burger will make you forget about at least several minor complaints that you currently have with life.
Depending on the situation, Sauvage might even be worth traveling for. It’ll make a date think that you’re cooler than you actually are, and getting a table here shouldn’t be a problem.

A Thanksgiving dinner with your in-laws might make you anxious enough to question whether true love is really worth the three hours at this dinner table. But, if you go in knowing that your father-in-law really, really hates NAFTA and that his idea of current popular culture is “the MTV,” then you increase your odds of having an enjoyable night.
At Evelina, the quality of your experience will also be dependent on going in with the right mindset. If you make use of the knowledge that this is a dark and relatively intimate spot where you should stick to the pasta section of the menu, then you will maximize your chances of having a nice dinner before the evening gets underway.
This is a Mediterranean restaurant in a part of Fort Greene that’s packed with good neighborhood spots, but Evelina feels cooler than most of them. The sleek space and dim lighting make it an ideal place to share some interesting wines and pastas with a date or small group. Each time we’ve come, the tables and long bar have been full of people who looked like they enjoyed their coffee get togethers and decided that dinner probably wouldn’t be a total waste of time. How likely these early-in-the-game daters are to come back to Evelina depends on what they order, and if they agree on things like spirit animal compatibility.The menu of Mediterranean small plates, pastas, and wood-fired entrees rotates weekly. We enjoyed most of the starters, and the persimmon and beets topped with stracciatella is one of the best salads, and appetizers in general, that we’ve had in a while. While the waitstaff will tell you that you can’t go wrong with any of the entrees, we strongly recommend sticking to the pastas.

The duck a l’orange, for example, is coated in North African spices, while the black bass comes with a madras curry. Also, definitely say yes when they ask if you want bread, because that’s just a good way to live your life, but also because you’ll get slabs of warm flatbread drenched in herbs and olive oil and served with soft cheese.

He’s trekked the Peruvian forests in search of cacao and base jumped off some impressive-sounding bridges you’ve never heard of. Sebastian has stories. Lots of very interesting stories. Unfortunately, the reality is that Sebastian also probably wears blazers with no undershirts and flies on private planes to Tiesto shows in Ibiza. 
Imagine if Sebastian had all of those experiences, but was actually just a nice guy who wears jeans and likes The Black Keys. In that case, Camperdown Elm would be the restaurant version of Sebastian.
Camperdown Elm is an ordinary-looking spot on the Park Slope/Windsor Terrace border named after an old tree in Prospect Park. It has about 30 seats, plus a long bar with views of the kitchen. Upon first glance, it appears to be another small Brooklyn restaurant with plenty of exposed brick and distressed wood. One look at the menu, however, and you’ll quickly realize that Camperdown Elm has a lot more to it than it lets on. 
Nearly every dish has an ingredient that will prompt you to type into your iPhone before the waiter returns. But don’t worry, because fortunately, much like our friend Sebastian, the waiters are happy to enlighten you without being condescending.

The octopus alone would be a must-order, but the bed of blood sausage makes this an absurdly good appetizer. Camperdown Elm’s bites of fried chicken thigh served with Japanese mayo may be the best chicken nuggets we’ve ever had. The dry-aged ribeye is so intensely flavored that we initially dismissed the accompanying steak sauce like a lemon wedge after a shot of expensive tequila. (We did end up ordering those muffins, by the way, and used them to mop up the steak sauce.)
Despite these high points, Camperdown Elm also has its fair share of dishes that are more focused on being unique than tasting good - and that’s what keeps this place from being on the level of the Wildairs and Olmsteds of the world. You’ll be able to tell your friends that you ate squid crackers with king mackerel pate and suckling pig with clams, but you probably won’t need to come back for another order.

It’s still run by the team behind Hundred Acres (which also owns the easy, reliable Vic’s and Cookshop), and they’ve made it into a Middle Eastern/Mediterranean place, serving things like kebabs and salads and a bunch of different vegetables and even some pink-colored hummus, which you might find endearing. It’s food everyone will want to eat, and all of it tastes good.Additionally, portions are pretty big, and with most dishes under $20, prices are very fair as well, particularly for the neighborhood. They also have plenty of space, with a bunch of big tables. It’s a win for any time you get stuck being the one who has to plan a moderately priced but still semi-nice brunch or dinner, in a convenient location, for people with assorted dietary wants and needs.
If anyone says this is their favorite restaurant in the city, you should probably take them out a bit more, but that’s also besides the point. Because Shuka is like watching You’ve Got Mail on a long plane ride - a safe choice you’ll be reasonably pleased with.","38 Macdougal St, New York, NY 10012",Manhattan,10012,activity might unpredictable outcome putting life saving bitcoin ordering sushi place never heard inviting friend family first improv show activity fairly predictable outcome watching tom hank movie airplane ordering pad thai place always order pad thai suggesting group dinner shuka thing change course life keep everyone happy safe choice shuka located western side soho space used hundred acre frankly restaurant safe may well crossing guard stationed inside insult rather way saying shuka straightforward agreeable still run team behind hundred acre also owns easy reliable vic cookshop made middle eastern mediterranean place serving thing like kebab salad bunch different vegetable even pink colored hummus might find endearing food everyone want eat taste good additionally portion pretty big dish 2 price fair well particularly neighborhood also plenty space bunch big table win time get stuck one plan moderately priced still semi nice brunch dinner convenient location people assorted dietary want need anyone say favorite restaurant city probably take bit also besides point shuka like watching got mail long plane ride safe choice reasonably pleased,"(40.6793219, -73.9207997)",40.6793219,-73.9207997

No matter how busy the place is, or how many band members are at the other five tables around you, the people working here will happily walk you through the list and help you find something you’ll like.

It involved a townhouse with hardwood floors and perfectly-level art on the walls.

And you’d just sit there with a cup of decaf, thinking about how nice it is not being that person. 
Maybe you had this dream for a while, or maybe it occurred briefly when you passed a Banana Republic and stared too long at the window display. If it happens to still be a dream of yours, we recommend you go to Fedora. 
Fedora is a restaurant in the West Village from the same people who own Joseph Leonard, Jeffrey’s Grocery, and Bar Sardine. It’s one narrow room in the basement of a townhouse, and it feels like a casual dinner party at the home of a person who’s been to Milan at least twice. It’s dark and intimate, and, while it isn’t new anymore, the whole place seems to be getting better with time. 
The menu here follows a pretty familiar formula: brussels sprouts, pork belly, roasted chicken, and other things that you’ve thought about making before drinking half a bottle of wine and ordering delivery. It might not sound exciting, and it isn’t going to win the James Beard award for Best Weird-Ass Modern Food - but it’s comforting, and you’ll finish all of it. The roasted chicken, for example, is one of the best in NYC, and the brussels sprouts have enough bacon and butter to qualify as an alternative fuel source.So maybe don’t come here with someone who uses a napkin to take the grease off their pizza.

And, once inside, you’ll find a restaurant that’s as fancy as you make it - by all means, put on something you can’t afford and have a date night here. Just know that the servers all wear t-shirts, and, as a rule, that means you can as well. 
Factor in the possibly-vinyl soundtrack coming from a small speaker in the corner, and what you get is a place that feels less like a restaurant and more like a living room that was converted into a supper club.

But for the rest of us, there’s Ugly Baby - an easy and excellent place to try something new. This restaurant serves food from all over Thailand, and it’s about the closest you get in NYC to feeling like you’re actually eating there, instead of in a little BYOB spot in the Brooklyn suburbia that is Carroll Gardens.
Ugly Baby is a single room with a handful of tables, a few bar seats overlooking the kitchen, and very little in the way of “vibe” - other than the walls, which are covered in rainbow murals. It kind of feels like what a restaurant would look like if you let artistically precocious eight-year-olds get high on Gushers and then have at it.
Based on the look of the place, you might not initially think Ugly Baby is the restaurant to help your boring Tuesday. But once your server drops your menu, you realize this is all stuff you haven’t seen at other Thai restaurants around NYC. The staff will happily explain things, but they’re mostly concerned with telling you how spicy each dish is. If they can tell you’re not prepared, they will make sure you’ve been warned. Go forth with confidence. Your Tuesday deserves it.And yes, a lot of the food here is very spicy, but not in the way that makes you feel like the world is closing in on you and you might not make it out alive. The spiciness at Ugly Baby isn’t there to punish you - it’s there to make things taste better. 
Most things here are worth ordering, but there are a few dishes so good that the other stuff on your table will get a little cold as you attempt to get them into your mouth as quickly as possible. One is the Khao Soi Nuer, a spicy curry noodle soup with beef shank, which you will think about longingly the next time you order a noodle soup somewhere else. Another is the Kah Moo Palo, described on the menu as “five spice pork leg stew.” That doesn’t do this justice: it’s a giant pork leg, covered in a layer of scrunched-up fat that looks kind of like a pug’s face. Lift up that layer (and do your best to forget about the pug’s face) and you will find some of the best pork you’ve ever eaten. It’s the kind of thing that gets dropped on your table as though it’s just another plate of noodles, when it actually deserves to come out in a parade with fire twirlers. And a herd of pugs. 
That’s exactly why Ugly Baby is perfect for a meal when you need to feel like your life isn’t just a repeating cycle of staring at your laptop and staring at your iPhone.

Do you go to an old favorite, or try something new? Do you want to hedge your bets on a place that doesn’t take reservations? Will the restaurant be ever-so-slightly disappointing, causing you to leave wishing you’d spent your money elsewhere? Would the place next door have been better? If you think this way, you’re probably very ambitious, and you’re also possibly terrible on dating apps.
And that’s just for a standard Friday night. When the stakes for dinner are even higher, it’s easy to get even more paralyzed. For most of us, going out to the kind of restaurants where you’re expected to eat from a $100+ tasting menu and possibly wear a sports jacket isn’t something you do very often, if ever. But if that’s an experience you’re looking to have for a special occasion, let us make this easy for you with what we’re calling the Fine Dining Decider.
If you love fish and are happy to stay in Midtown, it doesn’t get any better than Le Bernardin. If you want to be able to order a la carte and enjoy feeling powerful, try The Grill. If you like the idea of “tradition” and would happily go to France on all your vacations, you’d like Daniel. If you don’t care about tradition but are very rich, consider Momofuku Ko. If you like pasta, dramatic staircases, and the idea of being downtown, go to Del Posto.Del Posto is a big, dark space right off the West Side Highway and 16th Street that looks and feels a bit like a private club. It’s a little too fancy to be described as “cool,” but it’s also not stiff or uptight. The restaurant is set over two floors with a dramatic, fairly steep staircase, and if you sit upstairs and drink a bunch of wine, be careful when walking down.
There are two ways to go about dinner here. First, there’s a $149 four-course prix fixe option where you get to pick your appetizer, two pastas for the table, an entree, and dessert. Second, there’s a full-on eight-course chef’s tasting menu for $179, of which there’s also a vegan version. Whichever way you go, you’ll eat fantastic high-end Italian food, so the choice really depends on how much of a control freak you are. Based on what we established above, you’re probably a pretty big control freak, but we’d say as long as you’re not picky, leaving it in the kitchen’s hands can make for a memorable evening. If you’re willing to cut the evening part out, a meal at Del Posto can be had for a third of the price at lunch, when there’s a $49 three-course option, with an additional (and recommended) $10 pasta supplement.
Del Posto is not the place to come if you’re looking for a fine dining experience that involves wacky foams and gels and molecular gastronomy elements. It is the place to come if you like the idea of eating great pasta and a perfect piece of fish or veal, and you’d like to be treated like you’re at a five-star European hotel as you do it. New York is always going to be full of too many good choices (and probably even more bad ones), but as long as you enjoy excellent Italian food and outstanding service that makes you feel special, you’ll walk out of Del Posto pleased.",4.0,Italian,Del Posto,8.8,"Choosing a restaurant in New York for any old Friday night dinner can easily lead to a state of indecision paralysis.

You might all genuinely be friends, but the double date is often a slightly forced affair - dinner with your coworker and her never-before-seen spouse, or with your boyfriend’s high school friends who you’ve never met and have been a couple since they were 16. You need somewhere that has interesting and impressive food, and which will make you look like you’re cool and in-the-know. But you also need somewhere that everyone - even the picky half of that high school couple - will enjoy.
You need Don Angie.
Don Angie definitely ticks all of those boxes, but there’s also a very practical reason to come here with four people: many of the dishes are large and you’re going to want to order a lot of them. Take the stuffed garlic flatbread, which comes with eight cheesy, highly enjoyable pieces, or even the impressively-sized chrysanthemum salad. After that, you’ll want at least two of the pastas (we strongly endorse the gnocchi and the garganelli) and you might also want to try the $64 lasagna “for two,” which is both expensive and filling for two people if you want to order anything else. And you will want to order something else - the entrees, which range from a great piece of grilled fish or steak to a veal cutlet topped with cured meat, are excellent as well. If you eat here with just one other person, you might leave with a sense of existential dread about what you didn’t get to try, and probably also some unfinished dishes. We can tell you that from experience.Don Angie will also do you right for this hypothetical daunting double date night because the food is equal parts exciting and accessible - anyone you think at least qualifies as a mid-tier enjoyer of food will like it. Take the gnocchi, for example. It’s covered in poppy seeds, but is also basically just a bunch of cheese-filled dough balls. The best approach to ordering is to get some of the pastas and entrees to share, but if that coworker’s mystery spouse decides they just want a piece of chicken to themselves, Don Angie works for that too. Although much of the menu isn’t particularly healthy, a lot of the dishes are covered in salad, if that’s any consolation.
The restaurant is also dimly lit and sleek, with lots of leather and shiny things that feel like they could be on a fancy sailboat or luxury condo bathroom. In other words, it definitely has the date night feel. The space is pretty small though, meaning it’s not really a big group kind of place either.

We’re willing to bet that at least one of them is pretty cool, but also kind of a jerk. Maybe this friend doesn’t respond to your texts and always seems to have new clothing despite the fact that they work in publishing. Or maybe he or she shows obvious potential, but has yet to do anything that would make the person at the gates of the afterlife say, “Oh wow, I’ve always wanted to meet you.” If this friend were a restaurant, it would be Old Rose.
Old Rose is in the bottom of the Jane Hotel, and it feels like a ballroom that someone converted into a cafe. The ceilings are high, there are some big windows, and the walls are covered in paintings of centaur-like creatures doing stereotypical centaur things (drinking, playing the flute, etc.). It’s spacious, there’s room for groups, and it even feels kind of special.
The menu, on the other hand, is pretty straightforward. It’s Italian, and it has a few pizzas and pastas, a kale caesar, and some smaller things like octopus. And, while that might not sound very exciting, you should know that they do these staples pretty well. The pastas are solid, the pizzas are great (especially the clam one), and their side of meatballs with stracciatella is the sort of thing you dream about after you step in a puddle then see on Facebook that your ex is getting married to a person who’s slightly more attractive than you.Although not everything here is Italian. The pork ribs come with a sweet & sour sauce that could exist at a well-managed Panda Express, and the crispy rice salad with mint and pickled jalapeño feels something you’d get at a place like Dimes. We aren’t sure what these foods are doing on the menu, but they’re interesting, and they make us wonder what this restaurant could be if it weren’t just trying to be the millionth spot to serve cacio e pepe. 
We also wonder what this place would feel like if it weren’t so casual.

Food arrives slowly and sometimes out of order, and the bartenders are borderline mean (and not in a way that makes us like them due to daddy issues).
Still, Old Rose isn’t a bad restaurant. It’s actually pretty good - but it can be pretty frustrating, and its potential makes us a just a little bit sad. Fortunately, it’s affordable enough that you can look past certain defects and still have a good time. Come with a friend on a weeknight or stop by with a group on the weekend when a lively conversation will distract you from any lapses in service.

The menu is a take on Oaxacan food, and most dishes on it are both delicious and slightly different from other Mexican spots in the city.

Your boring coworker might say, “A cloud.” And the sarcastic one that no one likes might say, “Coffee.” Then, depending on how weird everyone else is, you might get things like “a bird,” “a different bird,” or “Caesar and Cleopatra on the royal barge.” Well, congratulations. You just made a Rorschach test. And if you want to try another, check out The Loyal.
The Loyal is in the West Village, it’s whatever you want it to be. It’s perfect for a fun night out, and it works just fine for a dinner with some parents. It’s also nice enough for an anniversary dinner, but it isn’t so prohibitively expensive that you couldn’t come here with a friend on a Thursday night. And feel free to bring whomever.
No matter who you take, they’ll find something to eat. The menu here is dense, with some 1950s-cruise-ship items like a lobster cocktail and other things that feel interesting and new like “drunken” eggs and mushroom carbonara. And, while there’s definitely a lot of meat here, vegetarians will have some options that won’t feel sad. This place is from the same people behind Nix, after all.There are, in fact, so many options here that you might be a little skeptical. The thing is: pretty much all the food is very good. We wouldn’t say there’s any one standout dish, but most of the stuff here is worth ordering. Even the smaller things like the plate of fried mushrooms and radish salad are great. You should, however, be sure to order at least one of the pastas (they’re appetizer-sized, so actually maybe get two) - and if you’re looking for a new burger, try the one here.

Your boring coworker might say, “A cloud.” And the sarcastic one that no one likes might say, “Coffee.” Then, depending on how weird everyone else is, you might get things like “a bird,” “a different bird,” or “Caesar and Cleopatra on the royal barge.” Well, congratulations. You just made a Rorschach test. And if you want to try another, check out The Loyal.
The Loyal is in the West Village, it’s whatever you want it to be. It’s perfect for a fun night out, and it works just fine for a dinner with some parents. It’s also nice enough for an anniversary dinner, but it isn’t so prohibitively expensive that you couldn’t come here with a friend on a Thursday night. And feel free to bring whomever.
No matter who you take, they’ll find something to eat. The menu here is dense, with some 1950s-cruise-ship items like a lobster cocktail and other things that feel interesting and new like “drunken” eggs and mushroom carbonara. And, while there’s definitely a lot of meat here, vegetarians will have some options that won’t feel sad. This place is from the same people behind Nix, after all.There are, in fact, so many options here that you might be a little skeptical. The thing is: pretty much all the food is very good.

Nur, a modern Middle Eastern restaurant in Flatiron, is not one of those restaurants. From the start, it knew exactly what it was trying to do: serve exciting Middle Eastern food in an exciting New York City restaurant. Which isn’t a surprise, since the guy behind Nur is one of the best-known chefs in Tel Aviv. 
In terms of food, they’ve mostly succeeded. Many dishes are interesting and delicious and just a little bit insane - like the eggplant dip that looks like what would happen if the spiral emoji took acid. As for the restaurant itself? The room is packed and music is blasting - it might be exciting, but it’s not the most pleasant place to eat.We’ll start with the good: there are some very high highs of a meal at Nur. The highest of which happens when your bread - a laptop-sized sesame bagel, a whole loaf of garlic and honey challah, or a pillowy mound of pull-apart kubaneh - hits the table. Whether you’re with one or four other people, in that moment everything will become a blur of limbs and carbs and dips and when it’s all over, you will be sad.
Luckily, there are other excellent things to eat after the bread: the aforementioned eggplant/acid spiral, “date doughnuts” that are actually smoked trout croquettes, and a pita stuffed with lamb and cheese to make what’s essentially an incredible hot pocket. There’s also the Casablanca Chraime - a pot of rich red fish stew that’s easily the best entree here.
That’s mainly because it’s delicious, but also because you get a lot - whereas Nur’s other entrees are pretty small portions for the money. Which is another thing: even if you don’t order the $37 lamb entree that only comes with two small pieces of meat, a meal here can get expensive quickly. 
And while the price point feels special occasion-appropriate, the rest of the details don’t. Nur’s below-ground, low-ceilinged space is like a garden apartment StreetEasy would refer to as “charming” (translation: cramped). They also play the Today’s Top Hits playlist from Spotify, loudly. Desserts like the “Hills of Jerusalem” sound cool, but come out looking like an architecture student’s senior project and tasting less good than the pint of ice cream in your freezer at home. 
Nur isn’t a perfect restaurant, and it’s probably not the place to go for a high-stakes occasion.

On one end of the spectrum, you have Watch the Throne, and toward the other end there’s that kindergarten-birthday-party song he did with Rihanna and Paul McCartney. Popina is somewhere in between. 
This restaurant does a mashup of Southern and Italian cuisine, and while it isn’t quite Kanye and Jay riding around in a Maybach with the doors chopped off, we’d say the combination works pretty well. Here, they make hybrid-sounding things like pappardelle with ham hock ragu and arancini that come with honey and butter. They also make a spicy chicken Milanese that tastes like something you’d get at a KFC drive-through in heaven.
The only issue is, none of these things are as original as they sound. They’re good, and they should all be on your table - but they don’t necessarily taste like dishes you’ve never had before. And that’s probably because, in the end, this place only feels about 10% Southern - which means that it’s essentially a very good neighborhood Italian place.
So whether or not you should go to Popina is really going to depend on what neighborhood you live in.

Additionally, there’s housemade hot sauce on every table, the ice cream comes from Portland’s incredible Salt & Straw, and whole loaves of their excellent bread are available for you to take home (or squander into your work bag for emergency snacks under your desk).

Or go eat some seafood in pretty much any coastal area. It probably won’t need much to taste great. Olive oil, salt, some other sh*t - we don’t know, we aren’t chefs. But at least a few people at Cervo’s are, and they seem to be familiar with this concept.
Cervo’s is from the people behind Hart’s, one of our favorite restaurants in Bed-Stuy, and the two places have a lot in common. They’re Mediterranean-inspired and fairly casual, and they both serve good, unpretentious food. There are, however, two key differences: Cervo’s is on the Lower East Side, and most of the menu is fish.
Here, you’ll find a lot of small things like sardines with radishes, a “crispy” egg with anchovies, and a plate of clams in a white wine sauce. The food is Portuguese/Spanish, and it’s all pretty straightforward in a home-cooked sort of way. The tuna conserva, for example, is basically just a great tuna salad with some lettuce, hazelnuts, and a ton of olive oil. It isn’t especially high-concept, but you probably wouldn’t be able to replicate it at home.There are also a few larger things here, and if you’re especially hungry, these are what you should focus on. The menu changes daily, but there’s pretty much always a whole fish (something like porgy or mackerel) and the same lamb burger they do at Hart’s. Compared to the sizes of the starters, both of these things are relatively good deals. 
And that’s one of the main things you should be aware of here. Two hungry people could probably eat every small plate at Cervo’s and still have room for a run to Shake Shack afterwards. This is the double-edged sword of quality seafood. It’s pricey, and the portions tend to be small. The clams, for example, are about $16 and amount to maybe one mouthful of food.
Keep that in mind if you’re on a date - a scenario that Cervo’s is pretty perfect for. This place is just one long, narrow room with a bar up front and a few tables in the back, and they keep the music at a volume that’s just right for when you want to look into someone’s eyes and tell them that you’d like to adopt a dog together, or that you’re willing to give up a life of crime to be with them, or both.

This tiny spot inside a dining car underneath a bridge was one of the first excellent restaurants to open in WIlliamsburg. And if you haven’t been back recently, consider it your duty to do so. 
We’re not just assigning you a meal at Diner because it’s a classic - we’re telling you to come here because, after many years, it’s still truly great. The burger alone is worth traveling for, and the rest of the menu feels like what would happen if someone went to the farmer’s market, came home, drank three negronis, got some sort of divine intervention, and started throwing stuff onto plates. It’s interesting, fun, and most importantly, really f*cking good. The same goes for brunch, which is just as impressive as dinner, if not even more so.
But no matter when you eat here, it always feels like an event. For one, it’s in an actual dining car. So if you run out of things to say to your date, you can casually ask what she thinks the 19th century petticoat-wearing train travelers would have to say about the tattoos and cutoffs crowd that now fills the space. (Actually, please don’t, that’s a terrible icebreaker.) Also, while it’s a pretty big dining car, it’s still a dining car - with low ceilings, narrow walkways, and very little room for privacy. The people-watching here is second to none.
Beyond the setting, Diner also has a signature party trick: the servers scribble the day’s offerings directly onto your butcher-paper tablecloth. Turns out you don’t need menus when you have the kind of staff who can make a two-minute illustrated food monologue something you’re actually excited to witness. By the end of it, your server might be squeezed into your booth with you, helping you plan your order. It’s over the top, kind of intense, and the type of thing that, anywhere else, would feel awkwardly forced. But at Diner, it’s all part of the magic. And the magic is still going strong, more than 20 years after opening.

They’re $125, and they come with about four domino-sized pieces of beef.Although, to be fair, nothing else costs close to $125, and most other dishes are at least borderline worth-it. Feel free to try the crab and uni nachos. The concept is a little Flavortown-esque - but they’re fun to eat, and there’s plenty of crab and uni. The tacos are also a reliable order, especially the ones that overlap with the menu at Taqueria.

From summer to fall of 2015, while other people were starting conversations with questions like, “What TV shows are you watching now that Mad Men is over?” and “Should I really see a hip hop musical about Alexander Hamilton?,” we were asking everyone we encountered in NYC one thing: whether they’d tried Babu Ji yet.
That first U.S. iteration of Babu Ji (they started in Australia) was something very special. The small, bright room on Avenue B was buzzing, the service made you feel like you were a guest at a cool dinner party, and there was an overall sense that you’d stumbled into a one-of-a-kind spot. And the Indian food - a mix of traditional dishes with some twists - was really, really good.
Unfortunately, that original Babu Ji is no more, but they are back in business with a new space on 13th and 5th. While some of that 2015 magic is gone, you can still have a nice meal here.

A la carte will certainly cost a bit less, but it’s not going to be a cheap meal either way - the dishes aren’t huge and they do add up very quickly. There isn’t a right or wrong way to do it.
Put it this way: bringing up Babu Ji isn’t going to be our lifeline in cocktail party conversation anymore. But if you never made it to the original, or are looking specifically for quality Indian food in a nice environment, we’d confidently send you to Babu Ji.

From summer to fall of 2015, while other people were starting conversations with questions like, “What TV shows are you watching now that Mad Men is over?” and “Should I really see a hip hop musical about Alexander Hamilton?,” we were asking everyone we encountered in NYC one thing: whether they’d tried Babu Ji yet.
That first U.S. iteration of Babu Ji (they started in Australia) was something very special. The small, bright room on Avenue B was buzzing, the service made you feel like you were a guest at a cool dinner party, and there was an overall sense that you’d stumbled into a one-of-a-kind spot. And the Indian food - a mix of traditional dishes with some twists - was really, really good.
Unfortunately, that original Babu Ji is no more, but they are back in business with a new space on 13th and 5th. While some of that 2015 magic is gone, you can still have a nice meal here.

To go along with it, you’ll definitely want something to drink, and Cote has some excellent options on the booze front. There’s a frozen rosé, which you can laugh at until you actually drink it, as well as a bunch of original cocktails that are strong, unusual, and really good. They have a pretty serious wine list too, and a big wraparound bar up front, so stopping by for an after-work drink is not a bad idea at all.

Gill sets up his criticism of a local vegetarian restaurant by dedicating a few hundred words to the idea that pandas are bullshit because they are the only mammal that chooses to be vegetarian, even though they have all the necessary facilities to eat meat (incisors, carnivore’s metabolism, bear DNA). He then parlays that into his argument that eating only vegetables in a restaurant is also bullshit.
This is not necessarily a view we share, as you can probably tell by the rating sitting at the top of this review. abcV is Jean-Georges’ third restaurant inside of the ABC Carpet & Home furniture store. It’s entirely meat free, and we think it’s the best of the three.
But our recent meals at abcV keep bringing that AA Gill review to mind. Not just because this is a vegetarian restaurant, but because the success of this restaurant and so many others like it has made it abundantly clear that we, advanced human beings, are basically becoming pandas.That fact is no more apparent than when you try to get a reservation here, which can be very difficult, especially at dinner. This place is consistently packed with big groups of people sharing a bottle of wine and a head of cauliflower and having no problems with the fact that there is no meat on this menu. As a matter of fact, they might not even notice.
And that’s the thing about abcV. That it is an entirely vegetarian restaurant is not the point. It’s just a feature. There’s no need for an asterisk, where we say that the food is great *for a vegetarian place. It’s great without a caveat. The menu is big and diverse, split into sections like “Grains & Legumes,” “Warm and Sustaining,” “Vegetables,” and “Brunch Bowls.” That last one we are opposed to on principle, but otherwise it’s hard to go wrong.
But the thing we like most about abcV is that they aren’t out to make a vegetable into something else. There’s no cashew cheese, and nothing is labeled as a “steak.” They just source great vegetables at the green market and make them into something delicious. Or find something creative to do with a dosa, or serve you an incredible plate of “wild fried rice.” There’s no sleight of hand, and we won’t cheapen it by trying to hit you over the head attempting to convince you that “even your most carnivorous friend will like it.” Because they will.

That first time trying the food at Emily’s original Clinton Hill location is something we would like to be wiped from our brains, so that we could do it all over again. And if we could un-experience the original Emily altogether, we have a feeling we’d be a lot more excited about Emily West Village.
To be clear, the food at the new Emily is very good. Great, even. If you’ve never been to the original Emily, it might blow your mind. But if you have, it just won’t feel the same - or taste quite as good.
The bar is set unbelievably high - the original Emily in Clinton Hill is a special place. It’s not only home to our all-time favorite burger in the city, but also to some fantastic thin-crust pizzas. And the small room, while fairly bare-bones, has some undeniable magic to it. The second location, Emmy Squared, in Williamsburg, serves thick, square Detroit-style pizzas and some incredible sandwiches. It’s the first place our mind goes when we decide we want to do something terrible for our bodies.
Emily West Village’s menu is essentially a mashup: there are thin-crust pizzas along with Detroit-style pizzas (though with different topping combinations than the other two locations), and a burger that splits the difference between the Emmy burger from Emily and the Le Big Matt, the double-stacked burger served in the basement of Emmy Squared.It’s all impressive stuff to put in your mouth, whether you’ve been to the other spots or not. But if you have been to the other Emilys, you might be a little disappointed. You might miss the original, thin-crust Colonie, or the thick-crust Roni Supreme (neither of which are on this menu). You might start thinking you can actually taste the difference in the pizza oven. And you’ll probably miss the old space, with its homey feel and super-friendly servers. Especially if you get seated in the basement room of the bi-level space - it feels like a dungeon down there.
If you’re someone who gets existential about pizza, know that we’ve considered the fact that a place deserves to be judged on its merit alone, without its history attached. While Emily West Village is the least-good option of the three Emily’s, it’s still a damn good spot on its own. If you’re set on sticking around Manhattan, and you want a taste of Emily, the West Village location is absolutely worth of your time.

Now that humanity has gotten “so much smarter,” we live in a world in which people put almond milk in their coffee and push giant tires around for exercise. It’s so boring.
There is, however, one vice left that we refuse to relinquish, no matter how bad doctors or nutritionists or part time yoga instructors say it is for us: eating pasta. And there’s a new restaurant in the East Village where we can do exactly that, and do it well. Meet Fiaschetteria Pistoia.Fiaschetteria Pistoia is a new restaurant from a group of people who own one other restaurant...in Tuscany. This is an exciting fact, because Tuscany is awesome. It’s also an exciting fact because they make traditional Italian pastas fresh every day. And so we at The Infatuation have found ourselves at Fiaschetteria Pistoia quite a bit lately, engaging in Holistic Carbohydrate Therapy. (Maybe if we call eating pasta by a different name, it will be OK to do it again.)
Now that you have some background, you probably have some questions. Is it really as good as that one little trattoria outside of Siena that I love? Is someone’s Nonna in the kitchen? How much pasta can I reasonably eat in one meal?
We’re not going to sit here and tell you that Fiaschetteria Pistoia is the second coming of that Bottega del Something place you stumbled into a few years ago on vacation in the Tuscan countryside. As a matter of fact, we’re not even going to tell you that it’s as good as the best rustic Italian restaurant in New York City. But we will say that if we were to rate Fiaschetteria Pistoia on the pasta alone, this restaurant would sit near the top of the stack in this town. When it comes to simple, authentic, near perfect classics like cacio e pepe or pappardelle al ragu, you’re gonna have a hard time finding better.
As for the overall experience, we find Fiaschetteria Pistoia to be pretty damn charming. The staff is incredibly friendly, the wine list is presented to you in the form of six or so bottles sitting in a milk bottle rack with tags around the necks listing price and varietal. It’s a pleasant place to spend some money eating well and imagining what it would be like to live a simpler life - one in which you work with your hands during the day and drink wine with your friends at night in some beautiful place that isn’t the corner of 11th Street and Avenue C. 
Unfortunately, there are also some things about Fiaschetteria Pistoia that we don’t love. The food outside of the pasta is inconsistent at best. We’ve had mixed results when wandering off into the “secondi” section of the menu, and consistently bad experiences with most of the things that they list as daily specials. On one visit we found a dish called “Hammer Down Shrimp” on offer, which we quickly learned was not something delicious named after a Primus song, but a plate of raw shrimp that had been poorly cleaned, flattened, and barely seasoned. No thank you. We’ve also consistently been annoyed with the fact that the red wines are poured at somewhere around 86 degrees. I don’t know where they store the chianti, but it tastes like they’re keeping some of it in the oven. That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t order wine here, but make sure to ask them to chill your bottle down a bit before you drink it. 
So, to answer your question, no a trip to Fiaschetteria Pistoia is not a replacement for a trip to Italy. But it is a perfect spot for a laid back Tuesday night dinner.

On one visit we found a dish called “Hammer Down Shrimp” on offer, which we quickly learned was not something delicious named after a Primus song, but a plate of raw shrimp that had been poorly cleaned, flattened, and barely seasoned. No thank you. We’ve also consistently been annoyed with the fact that the red wines are poured at somewhere around 86 degrees. I don’t know where they store the chianti, but it tastes like they’re keeping some of it in the oven. That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t order wine here, but make sure to ask them to chill your bottle down a bit before you drink it. 
So, to answer your question, no a trip to Fiaschetteria Pistoia is not a replacement for a trip to Italy. But it is a perfect spot for a laid back Tuesday night dinner. Just make sure to stick to the pastas - and bring your least enlightened friends.","647 E 11th, New York, NY 10009",Manhattan,10009,enlightenment suck adult thirty year ago nobody would telling u work every day eat super food meditate solve problem could deal personal issue old fashioned way burying deep deep inside dousing whiskey today humanity gotten much smarter live world people put almond milk coffee push giant tire around exercise boring however one vice left refuse relinquish matter bad doctor nutritionist part time yoga instructor say u eating pasta new restaurant east village exactly well meet fiaschetteria pistoia fiaschetteria pistoia new restaurant group people one restaurant tuscany exciting fact tuscany awesome also exciting fact make traditional italian pasta fresh every day infatuation found fiaschetteria pistoia quite bit lately engaging holistic carbohydrate therapy maybe call eating pasta different name ok background probably question really good one little trattoria outside siena love someone nonna kitchen much pasta reasonably eat one meal going sit tell fiaschetteria pistoia second coming bottega del something place stumbled year ago vacation tuscan countryside matter fact even going tell good best rustic italian restaurant new york city say rate fiaschetteria pistoia pasta alone restaurant would sit near top stack town come simple authentic near perfect classic like cacio e pepe pappardelle al ragu gonna hard time finding better overall experience find fiaschetteria pistoia pretty damn charming staff incredibly friendly wine list presented form six bottle sitting milk bottle rack tag around neck listing price varietal pleasant place spend money eating well imagining would like live simpler life one work hand day drink wine friend night beautiful place corner 11th street avenue c unfortunately also thing fiaschetteria pistoia love food outside pasta inconsistent best mixed result wandering secondo section menu consistently bad experience thing list daily special one visit found dish called hammer shrimp offer quickly learned something delicious named primus song plate raw shrimp poorly cleaned flattened barely seasoned thank also consistently annoyed fact red wine poured somewhere around 86 degree know store chianti taste like keeping oven mean order wine make sure ask chill bottle bit drink answer question trip fiaschetteria pistoia replacement trip italy perfect spot laid back tuesday night dinner make sure stick pasta bring least enlightened friend,"(43.3227292, -76.400769)",43.3227292,-76.400769

Who are all these people out to lunch on a Tuesday?
Sure, you’ll see Soho business types doing lunches at Balthazar and Lure Fishbar, but we’re talking about a different breed: the people at The Smile and Joseph Leonard, the ones wearing skinny jeans and expensive sneakers. If it’s a Friday afternoon, they might even be drinking white wine. There are sunglasses on the table.
Beyond assuming the word “consultant” is somehow involved, we can’t tell you exactly what it is these people do for a living. But we can tell you that they have convened at their quarterly meeting and decided on a new hangout. That place is Atla.Atla is a casual Mexican restaurant on Lafayette, run by the well-known chef who also owns Cosme, an excellent restaurant and Place The Obamas Once Ate. It’s a small, skinny place, in the ground floor of a high-end condo building, with big windows, muted colors, and a few green plants scattered around. Like Cosme, it’s cool and simple-looking, but the menus at the two restaurants are very different. Where Cosme does an uni tostada with bone marrow salsa, duck carnitas, and corn tempura softshell crab, Atla does enchiladas and chilaquiles. So don’t come in here thinking this will be “casual Cosme.”
Also don’t expect that the food will be as good as Cosme’s. At Atla, a few things are great, and most others are simply pleasant. The greats include a crispy fish milanese served with a tangy cucumber sauce, the pambazo sandwich which is mostly bread soaked in chorizo juice, and surprisingly, the avocado toast. The pleasants include an avocado stuffed with arctic char and a guacamole dish that comes with one massive chip. There are also a few things you can pretty much skip: an arctic char tostada that seems like some kind of riff on a bagel and cream cheese, a forgettable quinoa salad, and a coconut yogurt that feels more like a dessert.
On multiple visits, we’ve left Atla unsure of whether we love this place or not. A few dishes are really good, but not on the level that you’re thinking about them days later. We’ve been back at every time of day, and have found when you come makes a big impact. It’s nice at breakfast, but you’ll be missing out on most of the best dishes. Dinner, inconveniently, is our least favorite time to be at Atla - it can feel small and tight in here during peak times.

How dare you pollute my personal ozone of hot garbage smells and bus fumes with your mouth smog? Do you even work out?
That said, there are two things in this world that make me desperately want to smoke a cigarette again: hanging out in Paris, and having dinner at The Grill.
If you happen to be new to the food internet, have better things to do than keep up with daily restaurant news, or were born after 1983, there is some important backstory that you need to know before you read this review. Before The Grill was The Grill, it was a legendary restaurant called the Four Seasons. The Four Seasons opened in 1959 and became famous for many things over the years, such as pioneering the concept of “New American” cuisine, popularizing the idea of seasonal cooking, and being an exemplar of New York extravagance. But the Four Seasons was probably most famous for its powerful clientele. It was a place where heads of state, moguls, icons, and tycoons all came to be seen, cut deals, and maybe even eat some food.
Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, except for The Simpsons, and the Four Seasons closed in July of 2016 amidst a dispute with the owner of the building. To be honest, by that point, the restaurant was probably past its prime. But it certainly marked the end of an era.Now a new era begins, in which the Four Seasons has been brought back to life by Major Food Group, the owners of Carbone and Sadelle’s and other meticulously-crafted experiences masquerading as restaurants. They’ve taken over the entire space, splitting the famous dining rooms into two separate restaurants, and naming them after the colloquial terminology used back in the day to distinguish the two - The Grill (room) and The Pool (room). And they haven’t changed all that much aesthetically, because they can’t. Many elements of the classic Modernist interior are landmarked by the city. Even the curtains.
So, instead, it seems that Major Food Group decided to “Oceans 11” this bitch, which is to say they took the plot of something classic, tweaked the script a little, brought in some new actors, and spent an incredible amount of money on production. The end result is something that’s familiar if you’ve seen the original, but also different. Something that is great in its own right. Something that makes me want to smoke.
Why does The Grill make me want to return to that old bad habit of my youth? Part of it definitely comes from the fact that every element of this place has been designed to transport you back to a time before we had “good science” or a real understanding of “heart disease.” But really, it’s because every meal I have had here has ended with me feeling like some sort of legend from the past. Like a modern day Sammy Davis Jr. in a world full of Don Cheadles. The food is excellent, the service is perfect, and the entire experience is curated from the moment they open the door for you to the moment you leave. The prices? They are ridiculous. But that’s not the point.
The point is that The Grill is a place that gives me that feeling of doing something pleasurable but irresponsible. And I think that’s something we could all use from time to time.

They’ve taken over the entire space, splitting the famous dining rooms into two separate restaurants, and naming them after the colloquial terminology used back in the day to distinguish the two - The Grill (room) and The Pool (room). And they haven’t changed all that much aesthetically, because they can’t. Many elements of the classic Modernist interior are landmarked by the city. Even the curtains.
So, instead, it seems that Major Food Group decided to “Oceans 11” this bitch, which is to say they took the plot of something classic, tweaked the script a little, brought in some new actors, and spent an incredible amount of money on production. The end result is something that’s familiar if you’ve seen the original, but also different. Something that is great in its own right. Something that makes me want to smoke.
Why does The Grill make me want to return to that old bad habit of my youth? Part of it definitely comes from the fact that every element of this place has been designed to transport you back to a time before we had “good science” or a real understanding of “heart disease.” But really, it’s because every meal I have had here has ended with me feeling like some sort of legend from the past. Like a modern day Sammy Davis Jr. in a world full of Don Cheadles. The food is excellent, the service is perfect, and the entire experience is curated from the moment they open the door for you to the moment you leave. The prices? They are ridiculous. But that’s not the point.
The point is that The Grill is a place that gives me that feeling of doing something pleasurable but irresponsible. And I think that’s something we could all use from time to time. Lord knows we are living in a new era. You’re probably gonna need a smoke.","99 E 52nd St, New York, NY 10022",Manhattan,10022,smoke least anymore matter fact guy disgusted fast walk someone front street butt hand dare pollute personal ozone hot garbage smell bus fume mouth smog even work said two thing world make desperately want smoke cigarette hanging paris dinner grill happen new food internet better thing keep daily restaurant news born 1983 important backstory need know read review grill grill legendary restaurant called four season four season opened 1959 became famous many thing year pioneering concept new american cuisine popularizing idea seasonal cooking exemplar new york extravagance four season probably famous powerful clientele place head state mogul icon tycoon came seen cut deal maybe even eat food unfortunately good thing must come end except simpson four season closed july 2 16 amidst dispute owner building honest point restaurant probably past prime certainly marked end era new era begin four season brought back life major food group owner carbone sadelle meticulously crafted experience masquerading restaurant taken entire space splitting famous dining room two separate restaurant naming colloquial terminology used back day distinguish two grill room pool room changed much aesthetically many element classic modernist interior landmarked city even curtain instead seems major food group decided ocean 11 bitch say took plot something classic tweaked script little brought new actor spent incredible amount money production end result something familiar seen original also different something great right something make want smoke grill make want return old bad habit youth part definitely come fact every element place designed transport back time good science real understanding heart disease really every meal ended feeling like sort legend past like modern day sammy davis jr world full cheadles food excellent service perfect entire experience curated moment open door moment leave price ridiculous point point grill place give feeling something pleasurable irresponsible think something could use time time lord know living new era probably gonna need smoke,"(40.649444, -74.020352)",40.649444,-74.020352

But once you get home, you notice that your kitchen table is slanted. So slanted, in fact, that you wedge the dictionary under one of its legs, and voilà. Problem solved. Suddenly, your terrible present is useful. And all you had to do was think of it differently: as a wedge for your table.
That’s how you should approach Scarr’s Pizza. Treat it like a restaurant, and you won’t have the best time. But think of it as a (beer and wine) bar that just happens to serve pizza, and you might enjoy yourself.
Scarr’s is a tiny place on the Lower East Side, and it looks like it’s been around since the 1970’s. There’s a retro sign, a takeout counter, and a wood-paneled dining room with a couple of booths and a linoleum bar. It’s dark and old-school, and it feels sort of like a bowling alley without the lanes. 
But this isn’t average old-school pizza place. First off, people are into it. Like, really into it. Some nights, it feels like a clubhouse for the kids who achieved a measure of coolness during their last year of college and vowed to never lose that feeling.
They also have organic wine, baked clams, and a vegan caesar salad. Which might lead you to believe that this place is similar to a sit-down spot like Rubirosa or Lil Frankies. Thing is, it isn’t. There are only a few tables (that are pretty much always full), you order at the counter, and anything that isn’t a slice of pizza takes about twice as long as it would at any other restaurant.
Which brings us to our next point: don’t get anything but pizza here. If you try to order something else, the person at the counter will seem confused or annoyed or maybe even a little scared (like when Paul Walker misses a shot in Pleasantville and no one wants to touch his basketball). And once you place your order for baked clams or a meatball sub, you might not see your food for another forty minutes. Considering how cramped it gets in here, this isn’t ideal.
So, yes, as a restaurant, this place kind of sucks. As a cross between a dive bar and a slice joint, however, it works just fine. We can’t suggest it for a full meal (unless you come early or on quieter weeknight), but if you want to eat some pizza, drink a beer, and maybe run into someone you made out with once in college, it’s a decent choice.

You’ve read a new book every month, signed up for that half-marathon, stopped Irish exiting on bad dates, and purchased a water bottle so you could stop ruining the planet (but actually just because you really wanted that super-impressive $30 water bottle). You might have even already quit your terrible job and moved to Bali.
But just in case you haven’t done that last one yet, there’s Selamat Pagi - the closest thing you’ll get to quitting your job and moving to Bali, without actually having to quit your job and move to Bali. 
We ourselves have not quit our jobs and moved to Bali (yet), and it’s fair to say we’re not experts in Balinese food. But Selamat Pagi is Balinese-inspired, and if this food is like what you’d find on that island, we should probably all should start plotting a life change immediately.
The menu here is vegetable-heavy, pretty healthy, and very satisfying. You’ll be familiar with the kinds of things you’ll see on the menu (curries, noodles, fried rice), but Selamat Pagi does them all a bit differently. There’s the pumpkin curry that we could eat every day of the year, a spicy beef rendang (kind of like a stew) with pickled vegetables, and a fish curry in a turmeric broth that’s better than anything sold in latte form at your local Australian coffee shop. The fried rice is really flavorful, and comes with prawn chips for scooping. The papaya salad and shrimp & corn fritters are also great. To put it simply, if you enjoy a spread full of bowls full of colorful, tasty things, you will enjoy the food at Selamat Pagi.This place also feels like walking into a vacation. There’s palm leaf wallpaper, natural wood everywhere, paper lantern lights, and some neon pink signage. But unlike other similarly-designed spots that feel like cheap Instagram bait, you won’t find yourself stressed out at this restaurant. No one is wildly looking around trying to take mental (and iPhone) pictures of everything so they can try to copy it in their own apartment, and no one is talking too loudly about things no one cares about. The overall vibe is extremely low-key, the crowd is all neighborhood people, and it is in no way a production to eat here. 
The only real drawback? Selamat Pagi is in a far corner of deep Greenpoint. But no matter where you stand on your resolutions, you could probably use an escape. And that’s exactly what you’ll get here. No $1500 plane ticket or half-marathon training required.",2.0,Greenpoint,Selamat Pagi,8.1,"Congratulations, you’ve made it halfway through the year.

I came to New York because doing exciting things mattered more to me than having a “bedroom” or “livable space.” To live in this city is to have unique experiences every single day. 4 Charles Prime Rib is one of those experiences.Opened by the Chicago restaurateur responsible for Chicago’s most famous burger joint, Au Cheval, 4 Charles is basically a high-level concept restaurant. Imagine the same kind of set dressing and theatrics that you’ll find on display at Carbone, but instead of an old school Italian restaurant, this concept is a boozy steakhouse that you can easily picture someone like Sammy Davis Jr. frequenting in his day. It’s a small, dark place that you go to when you want to eat and drink irresponsibly, at irresponsible times of the evening.
Which brings up a few important points about this restaurant. First of all, it’s impossible to get a prime time reservation here. The space is very small, with no bar area, and they don’t turn tables quickly. That means that the few reservations that are available for normal dinner hours get snatched up quickly when they are released 30 days in advance. It also means that the times that will likely be available to you will be after 10:00pm. Some people see this as a bad thing. We do not. Because you’re not supposed to eat at 4 Charles Prime Rib before 10:00pm.

So you might as well go all in and experience this place the way it was meant to be experienced - late at night and with reckless intent.
That leads us to the second important thing to know about 4 Charles Prime Rib.

You might be disappointed to see that this particular strip of Williamsburg is starting to look like a little bit like some grayer version of Miami Beach or Dubai, and that the people who move here after college now are investment bankers who like EDM festivals.
Or, you can look at Leuca a different way: as a totally fine hotel restaurant. The pizzas and salads here are solid, there are big comfortable booths, the servers are nice, the wine list is great, and you can probably get a table for eight later this week. The food won’t blow you away, but it also won’t make you go home angry. If we got invited to a big group dinner here and didn’t come in with any expectations, we’d probably go home not-upset.Of course, we do come in with expectations and the knowledge of so many other good restaurants in the area, so it’s hard to get too excited about Leuca. But it’s hard to get too mad about it either.

Or, you can look at Leuca a different way: as a totally fine hotel restaurant. The pizzas and salads here are solid, there are big comfortable booths, the servers are nice, the wine list is great, and you can probably get a table for eight later this week. The food won’t blow you away, but it also won’t make you go home angry. If we got invited to a big group dinner here and didn’t come in with any expectations, we’d probably go home not-upset.Of course, we do come in with expectations and the knowledge of so many other good restaurants in the area, so it’s hard to get too excited about Leuca. But it’s hard to get too mad about it either. If you are one of those young investment bankers who likes EDM festivals and lives in a big building on Kent, you can bring your parents here when you can’t get into Lilia. If your boss nicely suggests doing the next team dinner in Brooklyn since the whole team lives there, but you suspect she actually would rather do it on the Upper East Side, you could do worse than Leuca.
It all depends on how you look at it.","111 N 12th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249",Brooklyn,11249,leuca big italian restaurant run famous chef located ground floor modern williamsburg hotel look bit like space station think restaurant one two way first way think big italian restaurant run guy bunch popular place manhattan building look like belongs midtown chelsea come leuca way end disappointed disappointed food good andrew carmellini restaurant like locanda verde lafayette might disappointed see particular strip williamsburg starting look like little bit like grayer version miami beach dubai people move college investment banker like edm festival look leuca different way totally fine hotel restaurant pizza salad solid big comfortable booth server nice wine list great probably get table eight later week food blow away also make go home angry got invited big group dinner come expectation probably go home upset course come expectation knowledge many good restaurant area hard get excited leuca hard get mad either one young investment banker like edm festival life big building kent bring parent get lilia bos nicely suggests next team dinner brooklyn since whole team life suspect actually would rather upper east side could worse leuca depends look,"(40.7224118, -73.9569215)",40.7224118,-73.9569215

When we say there’s no good food up there besides The Smith, we don’t really mean it. We don’t even like The Smith that much. It’s just a running joke. We’re sorry.
Because now we have Maison Pickle. It’s an uptown restaurant, but one that’s trying to feel “downtown” in a way that reminds us of an uncle who tries to seem younger by selling his house, buying an RV, and road tripping to Burning Man with a ziplock full of molly. It doesn’t quite work, and it all feels a little cheesy.
This place is run by the same people who own the popular Upper West Side restaurant Jacob’s Pickles, and it feels like an Applebee’s by way of the Meatpacking District. It’s fancy and good-looking, and there’s a troubling variety of food.
Here’s a small sample:

Half Pig Head Confit
Bacon Steak
Flounder Rockefeller 

And here’s another:

Shrimp Dumplings
Filet Mignon Au Poivre
Garlic Chile Cucumber

It’s a big menu. Probably too big, because most of the food ends up tasting like the stuff you’d get at a chain restaurant in a mall. Take the chicken and shrimp dish - it comes covered in cheese and creamy sauce, and it tastes like something a 1950′s housewife would make to passive-aggressively inform her husband that she resents him. 
That said, you might find a use for Maison Pickle. Cocktails, maybe. Or when you’re desperately looking for a young, well-dressed crowd north of 72nd Street. Because, at the end of the day, this is one of the few places on the Upper West Side that could almost pass for a “cool” downtown restaurant. It isn’t very cool - but if you know how to order, you might leave here not-unhappy. The French dips aren’t bad. They aren’t worth a trip, but if your uncle is driving his RV into town and wants to hang somewhere lively on the UWS, you guys could split one at the bar.

You may know some things about this land’s strange and unusual ways: its citizens own automobiles, and for recreation they enjoy walking up dusty hills with the companionship of a canine. At mealtimes, the residents typically place avocado on top of a bowl filled with other green vegetables, and frequently speak of their fondness for a hamburger restaurant and its “Animal Style” dishes. Whether they actually frequent these “In-N-Out” establishments regularly is uncertain, but mentioning this burger seems to be code for establishing one’s connection to the city. There is another place that restaurant-going Los Angeles residents also speak about frequently, and actually eat in frequently as well. This restaurant is called Sugarfish.
The reason we are taking you on this anthropological journey is that Sugarfish, which is known for its relatively affordable sushi menus, has arrived in New York. Sugarfish’s formula is simple: there are three set “Trust Me” menus, and almost everyone goes off one of these, because they’re a pretty damn good deal. Each of them starts out with edamame and a small cup of tuna sashimi, and then follows with sushi and handrolls - for $27 you’ll get four pieces and one handroll, for $39 you’ll get eight pieces and two handrolls, and for $51 you’ll get 12 pieces and two handrolls. The $27 “Trust Me Lite” is indeed very light for dinner, so we usually go for the $39 regular “Trust Me.” Whichever you opt for, you’ll get high-quality pieces of sushi that lean on the large side, and are made with rice that’s noticeably warm and very vinegary. It’s slightly different from the more delicate sushi you’ll find at top sushi places in New York, but still very satisfying.To answer the inevitable question, it is pretty much exactly the same quality as what you’ll find in LA. It costs slightly more here, but so does your apartment and, well, everything. The setup - a clean, modern room with a closed kitchen rather than a sushi bar - is the same too. The one key difference is that the lines at this New York location are, frankly, f*cking insane. With 10 locations in LA and some of the novelty having worn off, you can get into a West Coast Sugarfish with relative ease. Here, plan to get there before 6pm for dinner, and then expect to wait another hour or so until they text you.

The bartender friend who always comps your shots, the coffee guy who can always tell when you’re having a rough morning, or even the bodega cashier who’s memorized your drunk order so all you have to do is hand him your credit card and shamefully avoid eye contact - if you’ve achieved any of these situations, congratulations. You’re officially living out your very own New York City sitcom.
Ops, a restaurant serving great pizza in Bushwick, will make you feel like you’re already a regular from the minute you walk in the door. Even if you don’t live in this neighborhood, we think that feeling’s worth traveling for.
The menu is small (it’s a short list, and also weirdly physically tiny), with only one rotating cheese plate, appetizer, and salad - the rest is all pizza. Which is what you’re really here for. The sourdough crust is great, and if you dabble in square pies, their version is excellent. Meals at Ops are basically just bread and cheese, but we never feel the spiraling regret of a food hangover after eating here. Maybe that’s because they get all their ingredients from local farmers. Or maybe we’ve finally built up full bread and cheese immunity.The wine situation at Ops also adds to the we’re-already-all-friends vibe. There’s no wine list here - instead, they pour different natural wines every night and charge the same price for all of them. Don’t know anything about wine? They’ll let you try stuff until you find one you like. All of which plays into the greater theme at Ops, which is people actually being nice. As in, how people behave in Central Perk, but not so much in real-life NYC. 
As for the space, you couldn’t really think up a more ideal setting to put down roots in a restaurant. There’s brick everywhere, a salvaged wood ceiling that’s cool enough that you actually notice it, a long bar, a tile-covered pizza oven that glitters like Rainbow Fish, and thick red curtains that block out everything you don’t want to be thinking about right now - i.e. anything besides pizza and wine.
So while Ops is perfect for making into your new go-to casual hang, it’s equally great for impressing someone without looking like you’re trying too hard. We also saw a 50s-prom-themed bachelorette pizza party here, so you can do that too. Or just try strolling in on a random free night to eat a pizza by yourself at the bar.

I Sodi is a single, narrow room with white tablecloths, servers wearing ties, maybe eight tables, and a bar that takes up half of the space. It feels upscale, but it’s not trying too hard.

And that food is straightforward, classic Italian. Dishes so simple you’re confused when they end up tasting this good. Stuff like artichoke salad with only olive oil and parmesan, spaghetti cacio e pepe, and lasagna.

I mean, these people named their restaurant Sunday in Brooklyn.
But despite its name, and a space that feels like an amalgamation of every aspirational interior you’ve ever seen on Instagram, Sunday In Brooklyn actually isn’t as ridiculous as you might think. Sure, it feels like a place that people named Anton and Liza would hang out. But, judging by the crowd of people that also includes plenty of Courtneys and Kevins, Sunday in Brooklyn is a place pretty much anyone would want to hang out. 
It’s a great space, with exposed beams, a wood burning oven, and a big, nice bar. There’s lots of natural light during the day, white marble tabletops, and flowery china that looks like it came from a garage sale upstate.

From prohibition to PDT, we’ve been hiding booze behind trap doors and payphone booths for nearly a century. And yet somehow, every time another “secret” bar or restaurant opens, we still get excited like nobody has done it before. “Did you hear about that new bar? It’s in the back of a hair salon and you have to get a manicure before they will let you in. Even dudes. It’s lit.”
That’s the thing about these “hidden” places - usually the fact that you can’t see them from the street is the most interesting thing about them. So often you walk inside feeling excited that you gained access, only to find yet another prohibition-style bartender in a vest slowly muddling some basil. I’m not sure this city needs any more of those.What we do need more of are places like Karasu. Karasu isn’t exactly a “hidden” restaurant, though it is situated in the back of Walter’s in Fort Greene. And it’s most definitely not a speakeasy - or at least the kind of speakeasy that you’re imagining. Karasu is a cocktail-focused Japanese izakaya, with extremely unique drinks and very good food. You don’t knock on any fake doors or turn a giant bookshelf to get in, you don’t need a secret phone number, nor will you be asked to provide character references in order to get in. All you need is a friend or a date, a free evening in Fort Greene, and probably a reservation if you’re looking to go during prime hours.That’s the thing we love about Karasu - the lack of pretense. It’s interesting but not annoying, relaxed but extremely well put together. The drinks are completely unfamiliar and extremely good, and the menu is mostly familiar and exactly what you’ll want to eat after (or with) a few cocktails. It’s the perfect place for a first date when you don’t want to commit to a meal out of the gate, but also don’t want to go to a wine bar because it’ll tip the other person off to the fact that you spend more time in pajamas than you do real pants.
But best of all, Karasu will actually surprise you. My favorite drink here has bourbon, cold brew, and “creme de banana” in it, three words that when put together make my throat want to close up.

Then, after 25 minutes of confusion and expletives, you find them. They were sitting on the counter under a balled-up paper towel that you keep reusing because you finished the roll two days ago. You’d definitely already checked there twice. They just appeared out of nowhere.

Fast-forward to present day and Madonna is definitely not eating El Almacén. But we are, and we’re bringing our friends.

As for the food, will it blow your mind? Probably not, but that’s also not the point.

That place is gone forever, and though much has been retained for the new Union Square Cafe, drawing direct parallels between the two will only lead to frustration. Plus, I’m very bad at drawing.
We will say that, as fans of the first incarnation of this restaurant, we are pleased that this new location, just a few blocks over at 19th and Park, still feels a bit like the original Union Square Cafe. A few of the menu items have transferred over, some of the art on the walls is familiar, and the kitchen is still run by the chef who has been overseeing things since 2007.
And that’s where we’re going to leave it. The reality is, as time goes on, less and less of you will have experienced the original, and references to the past will do you no service. Also, nostalgia is for the weak.The good news is that the new Union Square Cafe is incredible on its own. It’s a master class in Danny Meyer restaurant operation, with perfect service and the kind of attention to detail that will impress you but also remind you that you’ve never been good at anything. The room is big and beautiful, the wine list is varied and full of great values, and the food ranges from “pretty damn good” to “did you just put a bowl of pasta in your purse?”
The vibe is both formal and just the right amount of informal, like sitting down in a restaurant you’ve been in a hundred times before, even if it’s your first time. Yes, it’s expensive, and yes, it will be full of a bunch of people wearing suits. But as much as Union Square Cafe is a special occasion restaurant, it’s also great for simply having a good time with some good friends over too much wine. We also love hitting it for a burger and beer during lunch, and if you really want the baller move, swing by the bar for dessert after a more casual date night nearby.
That said, whatever you want to use Union Square Cafe for, have a strategy. Reservations are extremely hard to come by, and while we’ve had some success with the early walk-in, it’s never an easy proposition. The restaurant does have two large bars that you can put your name in for and have a drink or three while you wait - something that wouldn’t have been practical in the original location.

As far as I can tell, your life entails knowing about assorted cool random old-timey theaters and scary-looking alleyways, but also sometimes convincing penthouse-dwelling people they should take money to let an actor shoot a movie in their penthouse.
Why are we telling you this? Well, first of all to tell you that Chinese Tuxedo would be a great place to film a certain kind of movie. It's also a nice way of getting to our main point, which is: we like things about this restaurant (the space in particular), but it's not a home run.
Located in an old opera house on Doyers Street in Chinatown, Chinese Tuxedo is a big space with unfinished concrete walls, a lot of plants, and a generally club-ish feeling room. It looks like the kind of place you'd see in some HBO version of 21st century New York, but which you don't actually end up at all too often unless you're a model or magazine editor. The whole windy alleyway of Doyers Street, actually, feels like it was made for a movie set version of New York: right next to Chinese Tuxedo is Apotheke, a ""speakeasy"" with an old European pharmacy theme that people line up for on weekend nights, and next to that is Nom Wah Tea Parlor, a dim sum place dating back to 1920 that people line up for on weekends during the daytime. Chinese Tuxedo could feel a little like it was trying too hard, but actually, the service is friendly and welcoming, and it's a good, unpretentious time here.The food, which is a modern take on Chinese, is what we haven't been totally amped about on our visits. Almost everything is tasty, but lacks that f*ck yes factor that makes us truly excited about our favorite restaurants. Things also get pricey, and not just in comparison to the excellent but cheap food you can get throughout Chinatown - a few orders of $20+ noodle dishes and $30+ entrees mean it's easy to have one of those nights where you're not sure how you ended up with an $85 per person check.
Chinese Tuxedo might be a fun suggestion for a group that's looking for a party-time dinner, without the terrible-ness of the places you might end up at in Meatpacking or the Lower East Side for such an affair (though it's worth noting they don't have a license for hard liquor yet).

On one visit to King, we came with what we're going to call a Kind-Of-Fancy friend. She knows a lot about lighting fixtures, she’ll choose the not-cheapest glass of wine before anyone else at the table figures out how to pronounce Aglianico, and she doesn't mind dropping $90 on a Tuesday night, especially if it's at a new spot.
Then we came back with another friend. He also knows how to order wine without word vomiting on himself. But for him to happily drop $90 at a restaurant, it needs to have some obvious f*ck-yes factor. This friend walked out of our dinner at King saying he probably didn’t need to come back.
We get it. King is across the street from Charlie Bird, and with its location, its young owners, and its daily-changing, hyper-seasonal menu, you expect it to feel just as cool as its neighbor. It doesn’t. King is much more formal - there are white tablecloths, the playlist is barely audible, the menu is short, the crowd swings mature, and the steak is called “onglet.” None of these are bad things, but they do get in the way of the f*ck-yes factor. 
But it's definitely there - you just have to look a little more closely. Once you accept that King isn’t what you expected, you settle in.

Which is part of the reason we’ve become fond of Atoboy, a Modern Korean restaurant in that part of town where Murray Hill meets the Gansevoort Hotel. What are we calling that now? Meatpacking East? Nevermind. It’s not the location that makes Atoboy interesting.
What makes Atoboy interesting is that it actually feels like something new. The space is minimal and unique, made up of concrete and wood like a spa, or the modern home kitchen of someone who has really good taste but has never experienced true love.  Most of the tables are built for four or more, and it’s a big place that’s almost always full of groups of friends having dinner together. Isn’t that nice? And that’s exactly what Atoboy was designed for. The menu is structured such that eating at this restaurant with just one other person is almost a waste. $42 gets you a choice of three small plates, each about the diameter of one of those oversized coffee mugs that people give as Secret Santa gifts to people they hate. And when you have four people at your table, you can pretty much sample the entire Atoboy menu if everyone orders something different.
The food is modern Korean, and much of what you eat at Atoboy will be excellent. Some of it, however, will not. For instance, the incredible fried chicken in spicy peanut butter is basically my Guy Fieri dreams realized, minus the hair gel and sweating. But the eggplant dish jiggles a little too much, which is to say that it jiggles at all.
The good news, though, is that you won’t care about the inconsistency too much, assuming you do things right. Bring some friends, drink some drinks, order a bunch of food, and have a good time. Atoboy isn’t a place that should be judged on individual dishes, but as the sum of its parts.

Brunch is dumb.
It’s dumb to pay $17 for two eggs. It’s dumb to wait an hour to eat said $17 eggs when you could cook them at home in one-twelfth of that time. It’s dumb to take pictures of said $17 eggs and put them on social media as if you should be congratulated for waiting for, paying for, and eating those eggs.
So when you find a place that makes brunch feel significantly less dumb, it means something. Esme is one of those places.

The pancakes are killer, the eggs are always cooked how you ask, and there’s homemade granola and a solid avocado toast and a fried chicken sandwich. And cocktails. Also important: prices are what you actually feel good about paying (nothing is over $14).

Emmy Squared’s pizza is the fancy, actually-delicious version of the thick-crust stuff you ate at every childhood party: cheese-fried-crunchy-crispy on the outside, warm-fluffy-molten on the inside. If you were the antisocial kid who always hoarded the cheesy breadsticks in the corner, Emmy Squared’s pizza is your new best friend.
.Eating here feels like something your mom would only let you do on special occasions. But now you’re an adult. And being an adult means that there’s no one standing between you and some deep-dish pizza, mayo-covered waffle fries, and a double-decker fried chicken sandwich. And the way to properly appreciate that freedom is to get yourself to Emmy.
About that fried chicken sandwich: it’s excellent. So excellent that we’d tell you to come to Emmy Squared for it alone. There’s also an incredible burger that easily rivals, if not tops Emily’s, though it’s only available at lunch in the restaurant, or on certain days in the evening at their bar downstairs.
Even Emmy’s space feels like Katie’s basement, where all the pizza-eating went down. It’s a little dark, it’s a little cramped, and it’s a little uncomfortable - but guess what: no one cares about not having backs on their chairs when they’re eating the adult version of kid pizza in a restaurant, especially when lots of alcohol is involved.
Just like the birthdays and sleepovers of your childhood, Emmy Squared probably isn’t for your average Tuesday night. But when the special occasion warrants it - whether that’s after a particularly rough day, or when Katie’s visiting from Texas, or when you’ve had enough of being kind of healthy - you can’t treat your inner eight-year-old much better than a pizza party at Emmy Squared.",2.0,American,Emmy Squared,8.4,"Remember the almighty pizza party? It was what you got for every birthday under the age of twelve, every sleepover at Katie S.’s (who had, come to think of it, kind of neglectful parents), and every celebration after your youth soccer/kickball/basketball team win. 
Emmy Squared, the second restaurant from the people behind Emily, is a full-on pizza rager - only with pizza better than anything your single-digit brain could have thought up. Emmy’s specialty is Detroit-style, which technically means it’s square and thick and the sauce is usually on top of the cheese - but those words don’t do it justice.

Not quite.
At first glance, Rider is an easy choice for a night out in Williamsburg. And if you do end up here, you'll be pleased with the food. It's well-executed across the board, with healthy-ish options and a couple real standouts. The service is also friendly. And the whole tip-included thing continues to trick us into thinking we’re getting a deal.
But Rider doesn't have a whole lot of magic. That special quality that makes you feel like you are truly winning at life. Or at least in your restaurant decision.Maybe that’s because Rider is trying a little too hard to be everything to everyone. The menu reads like a kitchen sink of stuff people tend to like. Roast vegetables? Check. Spaghetti? Yep. Chicken nuggets, a burger, fried oysters? Gang’s all here. Having lots of options is great - especially when you're with high-maintenance eaters - but there’s such a lack of focus you're left wondering what to order. On a recent trip, a server hard-sold our group on sharing the most expensive thing on the menu - the ribeye. It was good, not great. 
Rider's setup also has a case of split personality: there are two floors, which might as well be different restaurants. The bottom is light and bright, and feels like it should be in a hotel lobby, while the top is much darker, and reads a little too serious.
The experience ends up feeling best suited for French tourists staying in Airbnbs nearby who want to see Williamsburg. And older people who are suddenly interested in going out to eat in Brooklyn. We like grown-ups, and we like Europeans, but Rider isn't your best bet for seeing and being seen. Then again, neither is this part of Williamsburg anymore.
If you end up at Rider, you probably won’t fall in love with it, but you’ll enjoy it just fine. Especially if you’re with out-of-town relatives who want to see what “The Shmorgasburg” is.

Not because the impending apocalypse has people stocking up on readily available energy resources, and not because Gwyneth Paltrow just said that having a pot belly stove in your apartment will make your skin clearer (she didn’t).
The wood business is booming because all the new restaurants these days seem insistent on cooking with it.And we’re not complaining. A common thread amongst many of our all time favorite restaurants is the fact that they make food in a wood burning oven, from Lilia to Pasquale Jones to Speedy Romeo. Food just seems to taste better when cooked at very high temperatures in a dome shaped apparatus, and as far as we’re concerned, the more time we can spend in places that smell like a smoky Vermont cabin, the better. So now you know. If you want to get Infatuation excited about your restaurant, just open a spot modeled after an 18th century New England kitchen.
That’s why we were so excited to check out Freeks Mill, a restaurant in Gowanus that’s in the market for some wood. They have a small open kitchen in the back of their very aesthetically pleasing new restaurant, and in the back of that kitchen is a dome full of fire. And from that dome of fire comes some pretty delicious food.
Freek’s Mill is apparently inspired by the days when Gowanus was farm land, when the Canal was actually a creek and assumingly far less full of poison. What that means is locally sourced food gets cooked over flames, and the vibe is rustic but modern. Think of it as a mix between Vinegar Hill House and The Pines. We like both of those places a lot. And we like Freek’s Mill too.
But we also want to like Freek’s Mill a whole lot more than we currently do. Many of the things you’ll eat at this restaurant are absolutely excellent. The carrots, the pastas, the wood-fired oysters, the dry aged duck - they’re all very good. But there are also some times when things seem a bit too fussy - like the fried chicken livers on the dandelion salad, or the fact that the wine list is almost entirely made up of Chenin Blanc and Beaujolais. We assume there’s a reason for that, but we don’t really know what it is. People want options. And a lot of people don’t want Beaujolais.
Either way, Freek’s Mill is a solid addition to this part of Brooklyn, and we suspect that it’s the kind of place that will only get better over time. For Gowanus and the surrounding neighborhoods, it’s a very good option for your next date night or laid back evening out with some friends. Especially if you feel the same way that we do about fire wood.

Cayenne pepper will make you skinny, and turmeric will make you live forever. We’re down with all the fads. But we’re drawing the line at f*cking cauliflower rice. Can we really carry on like this?
Luckily, there are a few restaurant examples of the health food trend done right, without having to resort to serving people bags of sadness. But we’re betting you didn’t expect us to tell you that Hearth is one of them.Between the years of 2003-2014, Hearth was known as an excellent rustic Italian restaurant in the East Village that was Perfect For that night when your parents came to see your new apartment on 8th Street and you wanted to distract them from the fact that you’re spending $1600 a month to sleep standing up. It was a nice place, best saved for a special night out. It also wasn’t cheap, and the food was quite heavy. Nonetheless, we loved it.
Then, right around the time when everyone else in this town woke up and realized that eating ramen and pork buns three nights a week was probably a bad plan, chef/owner Marco Canora started tinkering with serving bone broth out of a tiny kitchen window next to Hearth. Apparently broth is good for you, and apparently people are willing to spend money drinking coffee cups full of it.
That, and other factors, led to a full revamp of the Hearth menu - and kitchen for that matter. No more processed oils, no more industrial flours, and fewer manufactured sugars are used to make the food, and the focus has shifted to more fresh vegetables, responsibly raised animals, and even house-milled flour to make the pastas. It’s a pretty major transformation that owes itself more to a change in belief system than it does an effort to keep up with a trend - and it’s one that has made the restaurant better.
In reality though, Hearth hasn’t changed all that much. It’s still an excellent place for dinner with a slightly higher price tag than most neighborhood restaurants, making it an unlikely candidate for those nights you’re coming home from work and just looking to eat something healthy.

The menu changes daily - they're either still getting a feel for what dishes work best or just really enjoy mixing it up - so it's tough to say what exactly to expect on a given night. That said, the appetizer section is the strongest (and seems to change the least), the pastas are small and tasty but not quite-destination worthy, and the entrees are actually pretty large - not usually something to write home about but a good move if you want to share something filling.
Cafe Altro Paradiso is run by the people behind Estela, the funky and beloved restaurant in Nolita that Obama ate in once. And frankly, if you haven't tried Estela, we'd direct you there first. It's cozier, a little more fun, and more of an essential New York restaurant. Cafe Altro Paradiso, on the other hand, is a nice place to have a glass of wine or a cocktail, perhaps at the bar, along with some starters and maybe a main course to share.

I have, mostly in all of those startup articles I don’t read. I think the concept basically boils down to the belief that, in business, it’s better to do one thing and do it very well, rather than to take on many things and execute them all rather poorly. That, or it’s the formula for building an ideal-sized pond for remote control boats. Either way, I’m about to work it into this restaurant review.
Here are just a few of the things that High Street on Hudson makes on a daily basis: bread, bagels, bialys, beet-cured salmon, granola, donuts, cookies, breakfast sandwiches, lunch sandwiches, salads, soups, and stroopwafels. And that’s all before dinner, which consists of things like grilled tripe, eel toast, cauliflower-stuffed pasta, sunflower seed risotto, crispy broccoli, and, of course, a chicken for two. If that’s not the definition of going a mile wide, nothing is. But somehow, High Street on Hudson manages to go deep on every single thing on that list.This West Village establishment comes to us via Philadelphia, where it’s been known as one of the city’s best restaurants basically since the day they opened in late 2013. Now that the chefs behind High Street have decided to bring a near exact replica to NYC, the question becomes, how will this do in a place with a whole lot more restaurants and plenty of bakeries, too? The answer so far seems to be: very well. High Street on Hudson draws crowds at most hours of the day, some for their excellent breakfast, many for the amazing sandwiches they offer during lunch, and dinner is usually bumping, too, when the menu turns more advanced and adventurous. We’ve been various times for various meals, and we like High Street a lot. They certainly do a lot of things, and they do a lot of them well.
The tricky thing with this restaurant is figuring out how best to incorporate it into your life. If you live in or near the West Village, it’s a fantastic place to grab a midday meal or pick up a loaf of bread, assuming you’re the kind of person that occasionally picks up loaves of bread. We can and have traveled for a lunchtime pastrami sandwich, and you should, too. High Street during the day is laid back and full of delicious things to eat. But dinner is the part we have a hard time with. Not because the food isn’t as good - nearly everything we’ve had at High Street at night has been excellent. It’s the use case.
Dinner is when it becomes apparent that this is a restaurant run by very serious food people. The menu is full of things you won’t see at most other places around town (see, tripe) and they offer a prix fixe that will take you on quite a ride. It’s also serious enough that High Street would be a tough destination for a date or a casual dinner in the ’hood. If you’re looking for a serious food experience, you’re in business. If you’re looking for a salad and a piece of halibut, you are not.

You always enjoyed yoga, but you tried different places and teachers, moving around like a yoga nomad. And then one day, you found this one instructor in a weird little new studio that happened to be right by your house, and you finally were like, ""OK I GET yoga now. This is cool. This is my spot."" And the rest was Downward Dog history.
Except. Imagine your little neighborhood spot suddenly decides it's going to rotate in new teachers every month or so, like some kind of Yoga Expo. Your reaction: thanks, but no thanks? As much as doing Bikram with some famous guy from Bali sounds exciting, you're probably never going to go back.
Turns out, after a few months, your prized instructor opens up their own spot. Everything's mostly the same, and there are even some fancy new features (better... mats?). But it's also a little out of the way, and although all the poses are the same, it's never exactly the same.In this hypothetical situation, Nakamura - a Lower East Side ramen spot - is that new studio. Ramen Lab, which we described as a religious experience when we first went, is that original studio. When it first opened, Ramen Lab was two guys, one always wearing a fedora, serving up light chicken-based ramen that was fairly transcendental. The noodles were great, but so was the funkiness of the place - the open kitchen, and the fact that you often had to stand while you ate. Ramen Lab has since transformed, and now plays host to a different famous ramen chef from a different part of the world every month or so. Cool as it sounds, the days and times it's open are unpredictable, and sometimes the whole place goes dark for weeks.
The two guys (fedora still included) are now at Nakamura, a little place on Delancey, right under the entrance to the Williamsburg Bridge. The original chicken ramen is there, and it's almost as good as we remember (there's a spicy version that is distinctly bad, though - do not order it). There are also some really good dumplings, and an interesting vegetarian ramen. That said, the magic isn't entirely there - without the open kitchen, the energy level is lower and it's just not quite as fun a place to eat as Ramen Lab.
So should you go out of your way to try Nakamura? If you're a dedicated ramen obsessive who particularly likes soups that aren't as heavy as those at Ippudo or Totto Ramen, it's a worthy bowl.

Uva is that restaurant that you turn to for date night when all else seems impossible.

It is worth noting that when crowded, Uva can be a bit loud, and it’s also very dark. But unless you’re planning on giving some sort of presentation at the table, that shouldn’t be an issue.
What that all adds up to is that by going with Uva for your next date, you can focus on what’s really important, and that’s being as impressive as any human can possibly be. So maybe that’s your slogan. “Don’t dress like an idiot.”

It quickly became one of the hippest places in the country to eat small quantities of food, and everyone wanted in - even Obama. The President’s visit definitely did more for his reputation than for Estela’s. By that time, Estela didn’t even need the help.
And while we liked Estela a lot when we first reviewed it, we just couldn’t fully back it. The small plates were great, but it was too uncomfortable (with its small tables, high volume, and general claustrophobia vibes) to be a useful restaurant for most situations.
But enough about history. Let’s live in the present. And presently, we have no more tolerance for uncomfortable dining situations than we did three years ago. In fact, we now have even less patience for having to dramatically over-enunciate so our friends can hear us, or sitting on a chair that’s only big enough for one butt cheek. Which is why we feel the need to tell you that Estela is now fully worthy of your time. The crowds (and the discomfort that comes with them) have eased up just slightly, and the best aspects of the food have gotten even better. Estela has evolved into a classic restaurant we’ll tell our friends to go to.You know that feeling you get in great restaurants, when you just know instinctively that you’re in capable hands? That’s what Estela feels like. The food is as creative as it is tasty, so much so that we were legitimately sad to get to the end of one plate, only to get just as excited about what was going to show up on our table next. The beef carpaccio is probably the best we’ve ever had - every bite is such a perfect mix of raw steak and crispy bits (Sunchoke? Onion? Potato chip? Impossible to tell, but it doesn’t matter.) that you forget you’re eating raw meat. And suddenly, a pile of burrata on top of charred bread swimming in a moat of green juice just makes so much sense - why would you want to eat burrata any other way? 
Considering how small the place is, they manage to pack in a ton of action without descending into total chaos. Sit at the bar for optimal people watching, or reserve a table on the other side of the restaurant for a slightly more formal experience. We even had luck walking in recently around 7pm on a Friday and getting seated immediately. Despite all its trendiness, and all its press, the experience at Estela remains a casual one – while you could use it for a special occasion, it feels much more suited for a regular night out.
Another big reason Estela’s been heavy in our rotation lately: brunch. Just when we were ready to cut the cord on paying $16 for anything having to do with eggs, Estela swooped right in to serve the kind worth getting out of bed for on a Sunday. The sweet, savory, highly memorable breakfast sandwich would be reason enough to go, but here’s the real kicker: they take brunch reservations.
So yes, Estela is still a little too loud, and a little too cramped, and a little too crowded. But it’s also great enough that you’ll most likely be able to forgive it for those things.

Which is why we feel the need to tell you that Estela is now fully worthy of your time. The crowds (and the discomfort that comes with them) have eased up just slightly, and the best aspects of the food have gotten even better. Estela has evolved into a classic restaurant we’ll tell our friends to go to.You know that feeling you get in great restaurants, when you just know instinctively that you’re in capable hands? That’s what Estela feels like. The food is as creative as it is tasty, so much so that we were legitimately sad to get to the end of one plate, only to get just as excited about what was going to show up on our table next. The beef carpaccio is probably the best we’ve ever had - every bite is such a perfect mix of raw steak and crispy bits (Sunchoke? Onion? Potato chip? Impossible to tell, but it doesn’t matter.) that you forget you’re eating raw meat. And suddenly, a pile of burrata on top of charred bread swimming in a moat of green juice just makes so much sense - why would you want to eat burrata any other way? 
Considering how small the place is, they manage to pack in a ton of action without descending into total chaos. Sit at the bar for optimal people watching, or reserve a table on the other side of the restaurant for a slightly more formal experience. We even had luck walking in recently around 7pm on a Friday and getting seated immediately. Despite all its trendiness, and all its press, the experience at Estela remains a casual one – while you could use it for a special occasion, it feels much more suited for a regular night out.
Another big reason Estela’s been heavy in our rotation lately: brunch. Just when we were ready to cut the cord on paying $16 for anything having to do with eggs, Estela swooped right in to serve the kind worth getting out of bed for on a Sunday. The sweet, savory, highly memorable breakfast sandwich would be reason enough to go, but here’s the real kicker: they take brunch reservations.
So yes, Estela is still a little too loud, and a little too cramped, and a little too crowded. But it’s also great enough that you’ll most likely be able to forgive it for those things. So f*ck that line that wraps around the block for ridiculous milkshakes or rainbow bagels – Estela is an actually good reason to get a little uncomfortable.","47 E.

The restaurants in question are never new hot spots, or places with a chef that anyone's heard of. Instead, they're usually reliable, affordable neighborhood spots - the kinds of places you can stop into for an impromptu Tuesday night or Sunday night dinner. 
Places like Lovely Day.
In fact, probably a dozen people have asked us not to write about Lovely Day, begging that we not ""blow up their spot,"" which might make us seem like assholes right about now. But after eating here about 100 times over the past five or so years, it seemed time. So here goes.
Lovely Day is a little cafe on Elizabeth Street in Nolita, serving Thai food, or at least Thai-ish food. It's a funky spot, with wallpaper that belongs in a dollhouse and tiny red leather booths and an old-timey cash register behind the bar.
The food is definitely not highly authentic or highly complex, but it is highly satisfying, almost in the way a great bodega egg and cheese is. The pad thai and the fried chicken and the green curry are always reliable: never too greasy or too sweet. Think of it as Thai comfort food. But the biggest draw is that it's highly inexpensive: hardly anything is over $10. That goes for the drinks too: there's even a full bar, and the cocktails are pretty cheap as well.Lovely Day draws a ""cool"" crowd. On any given night, most tables are filled with people who look like they work at an indie film production company and own an impressive collection of distressed vintage jean jackets. If this means anything to you, the owners of Dimes apparently met while working here.
There's often a wait at peak times, but since we've already committed to blowing up Lovely Day's spot, here's another secret: there's a second dining room downstairs. They won't tell you about it upstairs, but if you go back outside and down the stairs on the left, you can try your luck down there. The waiting lists are separate, but everything else is exactly the same.
Simply put, Lovely Day is one of the cheapest downtown Manhattan restaurants where you can still feel like you've had a fun night out. Where you can have a plate of good food and a cocktail, in a cool environment, and get out for a little over $20.

We all knew this was coming at one point or another. Now that the economy is better, your brother has left for college, and Mom finally understands that Uber isn’t an elaborate kidnapping service, a trip to Williamsburg for dinner with some friends suddenly isn’t such a daunting proposition for good old Rob and Sandy.But even despite all of those factors, one key thing has been missing - a restaurant in this part of Brooklyn that your parents actually wanted to go to.

To be fair, Lilia isn’t really a restaurant for parents. But it is definitely the most grown up restaurant in Williamsburg. The space - once an auto body shop - is huge and impressive and upscale yet comfortable, like L’Artusi or Il Buco Alimentari. The food is grown up, too. In the kitchen is Missy Robbins, who you might either know from her previous restaurant, A Voce, or from the time that you read somewhere that she’s Obama’s favorite chef. The menu is Italian in nature, full of pastas and vegetables and seafood dishes that are very good and also very professionally executed. Put it all together and what you end up with is a destination restaurant - one that is on the radar of people who wouldn’t otherwise find themselves in Williamsburg.
We definitely find ourselves in Williamsburg from time to time, and we were immediately impressed with Lilia. Over the span of about five different visits, we’ve found it to be consistently excellent, especially if you know how to order (see, Food Rundown). And while it’s definitely a destination restaurant, Lilia has a neighborhood vibe, too. The service is friendly and accommodating, and the bar is a great hang for a drink or dinner with a friend. There’s even a little cafe off to the side that serves casual lunch items for people who live and work around the area.

In its original incarnation on Division Street, Dimes was a small cafe full of dudes with man buns and probably also trust funds eating acai bowls. We liked it for its quirkiness and quality food and frequented it fairly often.
Then, as timing would have it, both healthy food and man buns became the hottest trends since techno became “EDM,” and Dimes had to move up the block to a larger space to meet demand. That’s when things got weird.
The food at Canal Street Dimes is the same as it was on Division Street, but nowadays, the vibe is different. Around this new location has coalesced a group of people whom we now refer to exclusively as the “Dimes Community.” These people frequent Dimes and other cool places around the Lower East Side and Chinatown, like the yoga place down the street from Dimes that also probably serves acai bowls, that coffee shop inside the skateboard shop, and Nicaragua. You are not one of them.

So it seems like it would be fitting that right under the BQE on the northern side of Williamsburg, you’ll find a restaurant called Llama Inn.
Thing is, if we’re speaking in broad strokes stereotypes here, Llama Inn is more like the hot exchange student in a '90s comedy: extremely beautiful and a little exotic considering the surroundings, but also really kind and charming. When Llama Inn walks into the room, heads turn.
The space is incredibly designed - there’s artwork made out of yarn covering one wall, multi-colored textile lampshades hanging from the ceiling, and plants dangling over the tops of the floor-to-ceiling windows surrounding the whole space. This isn’t Architectural Digest, but we’ll summarize: this place looks very cool.The food is Peruvian, or at least Peruvian-inspired, and it’s all highly tasty.

We actually ate our way through the menu with some friends who grew up in Peru, and while no one thought it was exactly an authentic taste of home, everyone agreed the food all tasted good. By the way, if you’re looking to take a trip to somewhere with amazing restaurants, go to Lima ASAP. In two days, we had four of the best meals we’ve ever had.
As for why and when you should take a trip to Llama Inn?

The reality of the city we live in right now is that nobody really wants or needs another down-the-middle steak place.

As for the menu, there are most definitely steaks – but there is also a myriad of other less meaty, more photogenic options, like roasted beet tabouleh and hamachi crudo.

Let’s apply that concept to this review.
Here, the resource is “a restaurant that isn’t awful near Penn Station,” and according to the amount of times we get asked about such a thing every day, there are a whole lot of people who want or need it. L’Amico takes great economic advantage of some scarcity.
Not that there aren’t other restaurants in this area - this is actually the second dining establishment to open in the lobby of the Eventi Hotel, also home to Lupulo. But scarcity isn’t about how many restaurants there are in a certain area. It’s about how many good ones there are. And Lupulo just isn’t very good.
L’Amico, however, is very good, and whoever conceptualized this restaurant is very familiar with both what the average New Yorker wants, and what this part of town definitely does not have - an aestethically pleasing restaurant that serves food that people like to eat. Like pasta. And pizza. And gelato. I also seem to remember from my state school economics class that anytime you replace a vowel with an apostrophe in the name of a business, revenues increase by 28%. It’s called the L’Artusi law.
That said, value correlates with availability, and if you were to put L’Amico in another part of town where restaurants with apostrophes in their names are in no short supply, it wouldn’t be so valuable. While the food here is definitely good, and the room is visually appealing, it gets extremely cramped during dinner hours. The bar is also very small and serves mediocre cocktails, and for some reason the dinner crowd consists mostly of Upper East Side women who look up to Bethenny Frankel and dress like Indiana Jones when they go out.
Our advice would be to use it whenever you find yourself in need of something near Penn Station that won’t make you sad, or anytime you can get out of your Midtown office in the middle of the day for a proper meal and maybe a glass of wine - L’Amico is at its best during lunch.

Here, the resource is “a restaurant that isn’t awful near Penn Station,” and according to the amount of times we get asked about such a thing every day, there are a whole lot of people who want or need it. L’Amico takes great economic advantage of some scarcity.
Not that there aren’t other restaurants in this area - this is actually the second dining establishment to open in the lobby of the Eventi Hotel, also home to Lupulo. But scarcity isn’t about how many restaurants there are in a certain area. It’s about how many good ones there are. And Lupulo just isn’t very good.
L’Amico, however, is very good, and whoever conceptualized this restaurant is very familiar with both what the average New Yorker wants, and what this part of town definitely does not have - an aestethically pleasing restaurant that serves food that people like to eat. Like pasta. And pizza. And gelato. I also seem to remember from my state school economics class that anytime you replace a vowel with an apostrophe in the name of a business, revenues increase by 28%. It’s called the L’Artusi law.
That said, value correlates with availability, and if you were to put L’Amico in another part of town where restaurants with apostrophes in their names are in no short supply, it wouldn’t be so valuable. While the food here is definitely good, and the room is visually appealing, it gets extremely cramped during dinner hours. The bar is also very small and serves mediocre cocktails, and for some reason the dinner crowd consists mostly of Upper East Side women who look up to Bethenny Frankel and dress like Indiana Jones when they go out.
Our advice would be to use it whenever you find yourself in need of something near Penn Station that won’t make you sad, or anytime you can get out of your Midtown office in the middle of the day for a proper meal and maybe a glass of wine - L’Amico is at its best during lunch.

Her Name Is Han has a lot of star potential. First, a great name – the perfect trifecta of memorable, unusual, and fun to say.

Third, and most important, both the food and the overall vibe are excellent, and unlike that of any others we’ve found in New York.
Han specializes in homestyle Korean food – which means everything from seafood stews, to plates of spicy pork, to noodle soups, to pan-fried dried fish that tastes like candy. All of it feels incredibly fresh and even light, an unusual combination when you’re eating food that’s spicy and fermented. No matter what we order here, it tends to be great.
Located a block away from the heart of the bright neon lights of Koreatown, Han is relatively laid back, but everyone here always seems to be having fun. Maybe it’s the $27 bottles of grapefruit and blueberry-infused, house-brewed soju, or the $6 soju cocktails. Maybe it’s the improbably great soul/jazz soundtrack that we Shazam-ed numerous times.

Fletcher’s is a traditional American cue with influences from all over the map. We got some hints of Texas, Carolina, and the Midwest.

Not a tragedy by any means, and their sauce is sweet and smoky heaven, but the mark of great BBQ is that it shouldn’t need to be sauced to be awesome.
The bottom line is that Fletcher’s is an excellent local option for anyone who lives in or around the Gowanus hood, but it’s not worth going out of your way for, unless you’re BBQ crawling BK like it’s the outskirts of Austin.

We published that initial review in August of 2009, not long after we birthed this fussy child of a website. Now that this thing has grown into a spoiled teenager, we figured it was time to circle back around on one of our most highly-held establishments.
Not that we really needed to. I’ve been to this, the original restaurant in the Blue Ribbon empire, so many times in the last six years that I could probably throw on a crisp white shirt and stand in as a server in the event of an emergency, except for the fact that I tend to sweat and yell at people when I get nervous. I can tell you with confidence that this place is exactly as good today as it was when it opened in 1992.
The thing you need to understand about Blue Ribbon and its 9.0 rating is that it did not earn that high number for being the greatest meal you can have in New York City. But Blue Ribbon is the greatest meal you can have at 3am in the
world. And that’s part of why you live here, isn’t it? Aren’t you the person who visits other major cities and complains about how everyone goes to bed too early? Or how you can’t get a slice of pizza at midnight? Or how grass and fresh air makes your skin itch? Well, Blue Ribbon Brasserie is the thing you have that nobody else does. While everyone else in lesser cities sleeps
soundly in their “houses,” you get to eat bone marrow and fried chicken from a white table cloth-covered table, in a room full (and it will be full) of other like-minded individuals at some unholy hour of the early morning. On a Tuesday.
What has always surprised me is how few people even know that. Most of the time when I tell people that Blue Ribbon is my favorite restaurant, they reply, “Oh, the sushi place!” or “You mean that chicken spot in the bowling alley?” This brand now has about 15 other establishments under its banner, and while we’re glad it has seen that level of success, most people these days don’t even know what the Brasserie is.
So with this updated review, let’s just say that if you find yourself in that group, you should fix it. Blue Ribbon is open until 4am every night, waiting to show you the way. Just pray you don’t see me stroll up to take your order.

We published that initial review in August of 2009, not long after we birthed this fussy child of a website. Now that this thing has grown into a spoiled teenager, we figured it was time to circle back around on one of our most highly-held establishments.
Not that we really needed to. I’ve been to this, the original restaurant in the Blue Ribbon empire, so many times in the last six years that I could probably throw on a crisp white shirt and stand in as a server in the event of an emergency, except for the fact that I tend to sweat and yell at people when I get nervous. I can tell you with confidence that this place is exactly as good today as it was when it opened in 1992.
The thing you need to understand about Blue Ribbon and its 9.0 rating is that it did not earn that high number for being the greatest meal you can have in New York City. But Blue Ribbon is the greatest meal you can have at 3am in the
world. And that’s part of why you live here, isn’t it? Aren’t you the person who visits other major cities and complains about how everyone goes to bed too early? Or how you can’t get a slice of pizza at midnight? Or how grass and fresh air makes your skin itch? Well, Blue Ribbon Brasserie is the thing you have that nobody else does. While everyone else in lesser cities sleeps
soundly in their “houses,” you get to eat bone marrow and fried chicken from a white table cloth-covered table, in a room full (and it will be full) of other like-minded individuals at some unholy hour of the early morning. On a Tuesday.
What has always surprised me is how few people even know that. Most of the time when I tell people that Blue Ribbon is my favorite restaurant, they reply, “Oh, the sushi place!” or “You mean that chicken spot in the bowling alley?” This brand now has about 15 other establishments under its banner, and while we’re glad it has seen that level of success, most people these days don’t even know what the Brasserie is.
So with this updated review, let’s just say that if you find yourself in that group, you should fix it. Blue Ribbon is open until 4am every night, waiting to show you the way. Just pray you don’t see me stroll up to take your order.

With the exception of Russ & Daughters finally opening a dining room, bagels, lox, eggs, and babka are generally still eaten at places that have been around for generations. And a lot of the time that place is grandma’s living room. Not anymore. Now we have Sadelle’s, and holy sh*t is it incredible.
Welcome to West Broadway Reform, Temple Of Hot Bagels. Sadelle’s is a modern day synagogue you don’t need to be Jewish to belong to, as long as you’re down to pray to the God of Smoked Salmon.
The restaurant comes from Major Food Group (the team behind Carbone, Dirty French, and Santina), and as we’ve grown accustomed to seeing, when they open a new place, they go big. It’s a production. And that’s very much the case at Sadelle’s: bagels and smoked fish are served on grand towers usually reserved for lobster and caviar. The staff wears throwback baking outfits and chant “hot bagels” in unison every time a new batch hits the pegs. The tables are set with the Laguiole cutlery and Le Creuset plates you’ve probably seen on someone’s wedding registry. And in the middle of it all is the bagel-making facility, enclosed in glass as if it were the fish tank housing the biggest, most impressive sharks at the aquarium.
Jewish appetizing in this city has certainly never been this flashy, but it’s also never been this good.
The space is huge, and split up into a sit down restaurant and a take-out bakery where you can get bagels and babka to go. Yes, the lines at the take-out area during prime time are long, but good luck finding an excellent bagel joint in NYC where you won’t have to wait 20 minutes at noon on Saturday. It comes with the territory, and it’s one of the few things New Yorkers seem totally fine with lining up for. If you’re eating in the restaurant, make a reservation, or come on a weekday.
The restaurant section offers a bigger menu, which includes everything from eggs to blintzes to turkey sandwiches to what may be the best french toast in New York City. The dishes are expensive - $17 for an egg sandwich is particularly crazy - but most of them are so good that we’re willing to deal with the inflated prices.

Not only are the imaginative pizzas that perfect balance of puffy, chewy, and charred, but the pastas, the vegetables, the meats, the beer selection, it all just seems to get better and better.

It’ll be like Blue Hill Stone Barns for kids in cutoff jean shorts and dirty Vans. Editor’s note: don’t believe any of the rumors we just made up.
Part of the reason Roberta’s is such a special place is because they haven’t done anything else yet. Instead of opening up new restaurants, they just keep expanding upon the original. Roberta’s is that indie rock band that makes an insane debut album, blows up, and instead of releasing new records, keeps putting out bonus tracks and remixes of the original album. Why? Either because the band is in a perpetual state of turmoil (fact), or they are content with what they have. Regardless, we’re cool with it.

Here's the thing about Domodomo, which took the place of beloved Tier 2 standby Ushiwakamaru on Houston Street: we're not sure which group it fits into.

Aesthetically, the place looks like it could be in Tier #1. It's probably the light wood, and the whole quiet, zen vibe of the place. They also serve you a tiny little tablet that expands into a towel when you drop it in some water that's enclosed in a polished rock. Don't worry about the details - point is, it feels fancy.

But what we keep coming back for here are the rice bowls. There versions topped with chicken or eel, but the raw fish is where it's at. The fish is extremely fresh, and for $10-$20 depending on size, also a pretty good deal.

There’s something about the way the light comes through from the river and hits the buildings, and there’s something about the quietness and the lack of people. There’s something about the beautifully designed stores with names you’ve never heard of but sell $2,000 sweaters. There’s something that makes you say, “Well, huh. This is nice. I think?”
Is this restaurant located in Copenhagen? Oslo? Portland, Oregon? Negative. It’s located on Greenwich Street, in the area known as Hudson Square or West SoHo, or “that area between Tribeca and the West Village.” It’s an interesting area - not the touristy/pseudo-artist loft-y scene of SoHo, not quite the suit crowd of Tribeca, and not quite the “my dog has 12,000 Instagram followers” scene of the West Village. It’s somewhere sort of in the middle, and unless you live or work here, it’s also probably an area you’ve spent very little time in.
Why are we telling you all this? Not because we’re starting to review neighborhoods. But because it tells you a lot of what you need to know about Houseman. Like its neighborhood, Houseman has all the tenets of being trendy and sceney (seasonal menu, chefs who come from well-known restaurants, understated yet also very nice interior) but it’s just removed enough that instead, it feels like a neighborhood spot. By the way, the food is also really good.In addition to being reflective of the area around it in a broad sense, Houseman is also influenced by the outside environment in a more direct way. Each day, the weather (e.g. hot and rainy) is printed at the top of the menu, and, our server told us, that’s taken into account when thinking about the food. We’re not sure that rain changes what gets cooked, but we can say that on our visits, the food was just the kind of stuff you’d want to eat on a hot summer day. And we have to imagine the same will be true when it gets cold again. Winter is coming, friends.
The best way to describe Houseman is to say this: It’s a restaurant for adults. Not old people! But sane people who want a really good, interesting dinner topped off with incredibly friendly service. Want to try a pickled bluefish dish that could easily come from some tasting menu in Copenhagen, but also a killer, totally unfancy burger that is one of the best you’ll have this year?

They do some pretty interesting things with fish - like taking the usual supporting cast of hake, fluke, and swordfish and turning them into starring leads - but mainstays like the fried chicken leg and homemade cavatelli are home runs, too. There’s also an excellent oyster happy hour. And don’t sleep on the cookie for dessert. It’s one of the best chocolate chip cookies in NYC.
Placing all cards on the table, my younger brother is the GM at Crave. It’s only appropriate that I reveal this fact, as you’re going to have to take my word that there’s no collusion going on here.

You walk into Belle Reve for the first time, thinking you’ve stumbled into one of those non-descript Tribeca bars on Church Street that’s been there forever but you’ve just never noticed it before. The place certainly has the look and feel of a random downtown New York shithole, but in a charming, “only in New York shithole” kind of way.
True to its New York uniqueness, it’s 10pm on a weeknight, they are still serving food, and there are several financial bros drinking at the bar. Nothing seems out of the ordinary yet, except for maybe the fact that the bros are wearing name tags, even though they are all probably named Alex. You sit down and order a beer from a friendly server, then peruse a menu that ranges from chips and guac and cajun shrimp to burrata and a lobster roll. Not usually a good sign, but you’re ok with it because everything else in this area is either very expensive or very bad and full of even more Alexes. You decide to take your chances with some burrata, the lobster roll, and a burger.
Now comes the first of a few surprises. Primarily, the food is far better than you expected it to be. Your burger is interesting (there’s deviled ham on top) and definitely satisfying. Burrata is never bad. Even the lobter roll is solid, and eating a lobster roll in a place like this would normally seem like a poor decision.
The next surprise comes when you realize that Belle Reve has not been there since the 80s, but only since the spring. You then learn that it is owned by some of the same people behind Employee’s Only and Macao Trading company, which partially explains what happens next.
As you are finishing your meal at about midnight, you notice that while you were focused on your food, the crowd has changed. There are a few tables around you, and they all seem to be filled with people in their 40s who still act like they are 20. The guy next to you looks a bit like Jeff Goldblum, and fittingly has two younger women with him.

Maybe next time you’ll be a bit more prepared. Maybe next time, you’ll be Jeff Goldblum.",2.0,American,Belle Reve,7.5,"It all seems so innocent at first.
You walk into Belle Reve for the first time, thinking you’ve stumbled into one of those non-descript Tribeca bars on Church Street that’s been there forever but you’ve just never noticed it before. The place certainly has the look and feel of a random downtown New York shithole, but in a charming, “only in New York shithole” kind of way.
True to its New York uniqueness, it’s 10pm on a weeknight, they are still serving food, and there are several financial bros drinking at the bar. Nothing seems out of the ordinary yet, except for maybe the fact that the bros are wearing name tags, even though they are all probably named Alex. You sit down and order a beer from a friendly server, then peruse a menu that ranges from chips and guac and cajun shrimp to burrata and a lobster roll. Not usually a good sign, but you’re ok with it because everything else in this area is either very expensive or very bad and full of even more Alexes. You decide to take your chances with some burrata, the lobster roll, and a burger.
Now comes the first of a few surprises. Primarily, the food is far better than you expected it to be. Your burger is interesting (there’s deviled ham on top) and definitely satisfying. Burrata is never bad. Even the lobter roll is solid, and eating a lobster roll in a place like this would normally seem like a poor decision.
The next surprise comes when you realize that Belle Reve has not been there since the 80s, but only since the spring. You then learn that it is owned by some of the same people behind Employee’s Only and Macao Trading company, which partially explains what happens next.
As you are finishing your meal at about midnight, you notice that while you were focused on your food, the crowd has changed. There are a few tables around you, and they all seem to be filled with people in their 40s who still act like they are 20. The guy next to you looks a bit like Jeff Goldblum, and fittingly has two younger women with him. The table across from him is occupied by two couples, none of whom appear to have day jobs, because they don’t need them. The Alexes have fled, and the music seems to be much louder than it was when you walk in. You ask for the check, because you do have a day job and you are not Jeff Goldblum. And then it happens.

“white hot”

in Manhattan


And yet despite such serious deficiencies, this Long Island City restaurant is packed every night with loyal neighborhood regulars and smart destination eaters. Why? Because of one particular thing that Casa Enrique absolutely is - the best Mexican food in New York City.
As you let that statement sink in, keep in mind that we’re trying to use fewer superlatives these days, especially when it comes to calling a restaurant the “best” of anything. “Things” change too quickly in this town, and as soon as one restaurant gets deemed the king, something else opens that does it better. That, or it ends up closing to make room for a condo with a froyo chain in the lobby. Viva la Williamsburg.
But in this instance, we feel comfortable calling Casa Enrique the best. Why? Because it definitely is the best right now, and new Mexican restaurants don’t come around in this town very often. Sure, we’ll get a Cosme every once in a while. But that’s not the kind of Mexican food we’re talking about. Neither is Empellón Cocina, or any other restaurant that puts pistachios in their guacamole. We’re talking real Mexican food, with chips and salsa and entrees made entirely of cheese, and we see no impending threat to Casa Enrique’s crown. Neither does the Michelin Guide, who handed them one star this year - the first to ever go to a Mexican restaurant in NYC.
So what earns a small Queens restaurant built inside of a house such high honors from The Infatuation and a tire company? Quality food, authenticity, and simplicity. The Casa Enrique menu is not complicated, and it’s certainly not “on trend.” You’ll find familiar things like enchiladas and chile rellenos and crab tostadas that are so well put together you’ll wish you could wear one as a tiny hat. What you won’t find are fusions of any kind or New York City interpretations of Mexican cuisine. That means no weird sh*t in your guacamole, and nobody claiming that carrot is the new corn. Just excellent food in a really nice environment, served to you by friendly people.

And I struggled with that language too.
But on to the restaurant.
Le District, the new marketplace at Brookfield Place in the Financial District, was billed as ""French Eataly."" Strong words, as Eataly is the gold standard by which all other indoor marketplaces will be judged. Eataly is impressive. In size, in quality, and in variety. There are so many different food and booze activities and experiences in there, you can spend an entire day there competing with your friends in some kind of hedonistic EEEEEATS Olympics. Le District is the complete opposite. It's small, it's about as compelling as the new Duane Reade ""fresh produce"" sections, and overall, it's remarkably unimpressive.

Let it be known, my inability to pronounce the name of this restaurant had zero effect on the actual review. Beaubourg did this to itself - with suspect food and horrible service. It doesn't help that the room also feels like a bad hotel restaurant.
Our server at Beaubourg was one of the worst we've ever encountered: he rolled up, and the first thing he said, in a non-sarcastic, totally serious tone, was: ""OK, I'm going to run through this menu, but I'm only doing it once, so pay attention."" Since the menu is stupidly written in French, apparently he'd grown annoyed with people asking tons of questions. Nice goatee, by the way. He was not pleased when we asked him a couple questions about the wine, and he also didn't take well to additional questions about the menu. His response to ""what's good here"" was, obviously, ""everything."" How's the pasta? ""About as good as pasta can get."" Cool. Very helpful. And it wasn't just his arrogance that irked us. The whole evening was a comedy of service errors: forgotten beverages, neglected small plate and silverware requests, promised bread that never showed. The only thing he seemed to be paying attention to was the hostess, whose pants he was trying to enter all night long.
The food didn't help out the situation, either. You can get better French-inspired eats at pretty much any French-inspired restaurant in NYC.

In case you aren’t already familiar, The Commodore is a Williamsburg restaurant by Pies ‘n’ Thighs alum Stephen Tanner, and it’s bad for you. Bad because merely looking at the food here will jack up your cholesterol thirty points, and worse because everything is so good that you’ll crave it all the time. Eventually you too will be cutting imaginary deals with your organs to justify frequent visits.
But before you ask the bartender to crush up some Lipitor into your frozen drink, there are a few drawbacks you should be aware of. First of all, this place can be a shit show in the absolute worst way. After 9pm it turns into pretty much the worst bar ever, packed with people who probably moved to Williamsburg because they heard about it on Two Broke Girls. Even if you’re there early, ordering food can be kind of a pain in the ass, and finding somewhere in the place to eat it is another challenge entirely. There is no hostess and there are no waiters, so basically you order from a window and then it’s a free for all between you and all of Brooklyn for one of the few tables. We ate our food off a Pac Man machine last time we were here.
The good news is that none of it will bother you too much, assuming your main goal is to eat some excellent fried chicken and suck back a few Commodores (piña colada with an amaretto float) while you wait. Those things are dangerous. So much so that I have now entered into negotiations with my liver.

What does that have to do with this restaurant review? Pizza Beach is our dynamite.

You see, Pizza Beach, a trendy new spot on the Upper East Side, is not good. The food is mediocre at best, the service is spotty, and the place has about twice as many tables as the square footage should comfortably allow. But the style and aesthetic of this restaurant are so perfectly targeted to the food porn generation that the mostly post-college clientele couldn't care less about any of those things. This place is absolutely packed every day with people who are too busy posting a photo to notice.
Now, we are obviously not accountable for the things that come out of Pizza Beach's kitchen, and we are certainly not claiming responsibility for creating the kind of person that values followers over food quality - The Infatuation audience is much more discerning than that. But, much like Sir Nobel, we do feel the need to take action.

Maybe that depends on where you worship. If spending a Sunday at Gramercy Tavern feels like the Sabbath to you, you’re going to like it here at Untitled.
Untitled is Danny Meyer’s restaurant at the new Whitney Museum, just as it was in the old Whitney Museum. But this version is a much different piece of work, largely thanks to the fact that Gramercy Tavern’s Michael Anthony is the Executive Chef. The food at Untitled feels strongly influenced by the menu at Gramercy Tavern - most dishes are highly composed yet also very simple, and almost all have some sort of bright green sauce on the plate (that’s how you know it’s an authentic Michael Anthony). It’s all very familiar if you’ve ever spent an evening eating in the Gramercy Tavern bar, which we most definitely have. And everything we’ve eaten here so far has been nearly on that level.
The things that probably won’t be familiar to you at Untitled are the prices. The most expensive item on the menu on our most recent visit was a $27 lamb chop, and some of the small plates and starters cost as little as $12. For food of this caliber, and considering the fact that you are both in a museum and in the Meatpacking District, that’s a pretty good deal. You and your mom could definitely have a very nice dinner here and spend less than $100 - depending on whether or not she’s the type to go a little Lucille Bluth on the Sauvingon Blanc.
And while Untitled is most definitely an ideal spot for Dinner With The Parents, it’s also Perfect For several other situations, from a night out with the girls, to a night out with some clients, to a meal with your cousins who are visiting from Texas. There’s even some great outdoor seating, which makes it an excellent spot to watch the all Meatpacking action walk by - forget about the art, that’s the real cultural entertainment on display here.

Or at least some people think so. Should you find yourself planning to eat at Javelina, a new Tex-Mexican restaurant in Gramercy, prepare to hear that statement a lot - both leading up to and during your meal.
If you're the type who researches your dinner before you eat it, you'll certainly come across several write-ups containing this very claim. As a matter of fact, Eater has seemed singlehandedly determined to make Javelina a success from the start - calling it a ""white hot sensation"" almost immediately after it opened, and even attesting to one menu item's Tex Mex legitimacy based on smell alone. Maybe the nose knows best. Or maybe they were just smelling some guaranteed pageviews.
As you are about to find out, we don't necessarily agree that Javelina is the true arrival of San Antonio in Manhattan. But the Javelina staff (obviously) do, and they will be sure to mention it at some point during your meal. They might even go so far as to name all of the folks on payroll who are from the actual, real life state of Texas. I can appreciate some love for the Lone Star State - much of my family is there. But this particular tactic adds about as much credibility to the meal as a plastic cactus on the table might. Let's let the food speak for itself. Then again, the most Texan thing you could possibly do in this situation is boast about anything and everything from Texas, so maybe keep it up. Go Cowboys.
Those who tout Javelina's ultimate Tex-Mexiness will point to one key piece of evidence from the menu, known best to Mexican food fans and elementary level Spanish speakers as ""queso."" Javelina has several varieties of queso on the menu, from ""yellow"" to ""white"" to a Texas classic called Bob Armstrong dip, which is basically Velveeta plus guac plus sour cream. Is it good? Of course it is. There is no such thing as bad melted cheese. But we also aren't ready to tell you to line up at Javelina to get your hands on the stuff. Other restaurants in town serve queso - and they are just as authentic to TexMexico as whatever you'll eat here. Alternatively, you could just fire up the microwave and serve some to yourself.
Beyond the queso, we've found the menu at Javelina to be full of hits and misses. I had a chile relleno here the other day that was excellent. Most of the tacos are a snooze. The enchiladas are fine, and the fajitas are satisfying. But there's one thing I can't get past, and it is undeniably affecting my opinion of this restaurant - the chips and salsa suck. Anyone who knows anything about a true Tex-Mex meal knows that 75% of the experience is eating so many fcking chips and so much salsa that you can hardly look at your enchiladas once they arrive because your mouth is on fire and you're so full you could barf. I've never been able to exercise will power when a basket of salty chips and good salsa is in front of me - I will shovel that sht into my mouth until man or divine intervention puts a stop to me. At Javelina I hit it and quit it with ease. The salsa is bland and the chips need salt. That's a cardinal sin in my book. And if I'm not excited about my entree with my appetite at full strength, what does that say? Probably that if I want to eat this food, I should just go to Texas.

A bodega that actually melts the cheese on their egg sandwiches. A pizza place that's open late on weekends. A yoga studio where the instructors actually wear deodorant. And a pretty decent Thai place.
If you're on the Upper East Side, Up Thai should be that place.
First things first: the food. It's good! It's not SriPraPhai-good, and is sometimes a bit too sweet, but it also doesn't require a trip to Woodside. Considering this restaurant's location on the same block as the Upper East Side outpost of Bounce Sporting Club, it's a relatively impressive operation.
When evaluating local Thai spots, we like to run restaurants through our patented Solid Neighborhood Thai Restaurant Test, which features just one question - ""Would you eat anything other than pad thai here?"" Up Thai gets an A on that test. There's a whole menu of dishes worth ordering, from peanut-filled dumplings to excellent crispy duck, and that's what helps separate it from your run of the mill joints. With that in mind, dragging your human body over here rather than using your robot arm to press the Seamless buttons is worth considering because the more unusual dishes aren't totally primed for travel - a head-on fish or a ""Thai bouillabaisse"" suffer a bit from the delivery bag.
The other thing that separates it from the slew of Thai restaurants in the area? The space is done up like it's going to the prom. The prom in like, Texas. Or somewhere where the prom is taken seriously. You've got faux rustic brick walls, Persian lanterns, and plants hanging from the ceiling. Despite how that sounds, it actually manages to feel comfortable and almost borderline romantic, rather than like a West Elm that vomited on itself.

Pasta hasn’t always been this prolific, though.

Up to that point, most “pasta” restaurants also had “rasta” somewhere in the name. Rhyming = marketing, by the way.
We’ve always loved Porsena, and in fairness, should probably explain that this is technically a restaurant that serves Tuscan food - not just carbohydrates in sauce. But the pasta is what you should come for. For as long as we’ve been eating here, we can’t remember a single starchy bowl that we haven’t absolutely loved. In every instance, the noodles are cooked perfectly al dente, the sauces are flavorful and interesting, and the portion sizes are an ideal single serving.

But you should know that we are currently bribing lobbying City Hall to provide each local resident one get-out-of-jail-free card, allowing a single instance of street shoving per year without consequence. Where did all these people come from? No idea. But feel free to give them all a friendly nudge toward Guys' American Kitchen next time you're in the neighborhood.
Now that you know that you can freely maneuver in Times Square with the proper blessing from local politicians, allow us to suggest you hurry up and get to Margon, a cafeteria-style Latin American restaurant with one of the city's best Cuban sandwiches, along with many other Latin delicacies.
Margon is no secret - at least to people who know what's what in this part of town. It's often just as crowded and sweaty as the inside of an Elmo costume, and for first timers, it can be a bit intimidating. Nobody is there to greet you, seat you, or ask you how they can help. There is an old dude who seems to have his eye on everything, but he doesn't really have teeth or speak English, so unfortunately you can't rely on him for much. Luckily, everyone is smiling, and they're happy to have you. Proceed with confidence.
When it comes to navigating an order, if you're just looking for a sandwich for the road, hit up the grill guy right when you walk in.

But you should know that we are currently bribing lobbying City Hall to provide each local resident one get-out-of-jail-free card, allowing a single instance of street shoving per year without consequence. Where did all these people come from? No idea. But feel free to give them all a friendly nudge toward Guys' American Kitchen next time you're in the neighborhood.
Now that you know that you can freely maneuver in Times Square with the proper blessing from local politicians, allow us to suggest you hurry up and get to Margon, a cafeteria-style Latin American restaurant with one of the city's best Cuban sandwiches, along with many other Latin delicacies.
Margon is no secret - at least to people who know what's what in this part of town. It's often just as crowded and sweaty as the inside of an Elmo costume, and for first timers, it can be a bit intimidating. Nobody is there to greet you, seat you, or ask you how they can help. There is an old dude who seems to have his eye on everything, but he doesn't really have teeth or speak English, so unfortunately you can't rely on him for much. Luckily, everyone is smiling, and they're happy to have you. Proceed with confidence.

Not 100% of the time, but in a solid 7 out 10 instances, it tastes like it may or may not have been outside since yesterday.

Beyond Sushi is a little spot specializing in ""vegan sushi"" and some other healthy plant-based, Asian-inspired foods. Questionable as that may sound, a lot of the food turns out to be extremely satisfying. And tasty. And this is coming from someone who thinks people should receive a Nobel prize nomination for finishing a bottle of green juice. Bear with me. I'm converting you to vegan sushi, not Scientology.
The rolls combine things like mango and avocado and the occasional pickled carrot, for a result that tastes surprisingly like... sushi. Think of it as what you're probably looking for when you order from your local delivery, but removing the likelihood it'll be kind of funky.
We mostly rely on Beyond Sushi for delivery, and they know what they're doing in that regard. The spicy mayo-type concoction that accompanies bunch of the rolls comes in a little squeezable vial, a practice that all sushi places should immediately adopt.

We're talking here about the space on 14th Street, but there are also locations in Chelsea Market and on 55th and 6th, so get that into your midtown lunch rotation stat.
If you think a piece of mango sushi topped with vegan wasabi mayo sounds egregious, your qualms are entirely understood.

That’s not to say she is angry or rude, because she is neither. It’s just, having overcome a number of obstacles over the years - including two fires and Hurricane Sandy - The Mayor is all business, with no use for time-consuming things like smiling or acknowledging your existence.
On a recent trip, we seated ourselves at one of the eight tables in the room and waited 15 minutes before The Mayor made her way over.

It's a tiny, cozy joint with simple Italian cooking, and the food is consistently excellent. That's saying a lot, considering they've been doing this for over a decade. Also adding to the awesome is a very reasonably priced wine selection and playlists that are heavy on The Stones and Zeppelin. It's a nice place to linger, especially in the summer when the back garden is open. Downside? Tough to linger when you can't get a table. Waits can push well past an hour during prime time, sometimes close to two. Every once in a while you'll get lucky and sit sooner than you expect, but there isn't a ton of bar real estate, so you're just going to have to be OK taking a bit of a gamble. The bummer of it all is that without those unpredictable waits, this restaurant would be an absolutely ideal date spot.

Hanjan was one of the first new guys to move into the now well-populated restaurant row on 26th Street. We’re big fans of Chef Hooni Kim, who executes Korean fare in a modern style in an environment that’s fun and welcoming. He’s essentially David Chang without the pork buns and the fanfare.

Some restaurants are all about familiarity and comfort. Others make you say, “I have no idea what exactly the hell is going on, but it’s incredible.” Kang Ho Dong Baekjong, the new Koreatown outpost of a beloved Korean barbecue spot with locations in Flushing and LA, falls squarely in the latter camp.
Even if you’re familiar with Korean barbecue, the Baekjong experience is something different. For starters, everything’s of really high quality: from the meats and the sides, to the friendly and super helpful servers, who actually cook the food for you at the grill on your table, unlike many Korean BBQ spots where you do it yourself. Sorry DIY dabblers, go make a terrarium when you get home. Then there are also the special smoke vacuum contraptions over every table that stop you from smelling like a firepit, as well as the ring of egg omelet batter and cheesy corn around your grill, which cooks slowly throughout the meal. And of course, there’s the sporadic eruption of “Gangnam Style"" (pretty sure it’s for birthdays).
The only downside is the perpetually long waits, but you can track your progress in line through an app, which gives you the freedom to check out some K-Town spots down the block while you wait. For a more refined time, check out Soju House around the corner, or for a decidedly not refined time, hit Pocha 32, where you can get liquor served out of a watermelon.
One tip: make sure to order one of the combos, or at least a selection of different meats. A big part of the fun here is the constant cooking, and if you stick to one or two items, you’ll miss out on the action. Pile it on, go with the flow. Sing the words to “Gangnam Style.""

Nope, it was just the average lunch queue at Burger & Lobster, the UK mini-chain of hip restaurants that just serves two different delicacies: burgers and lobsters. Duh. We popped our head in just for fun to see how long the wait was. In addition to the 40-50 people mulling on the skinny Soho sidewalk out front, another 20-30 were jammed into the waiting area at the front of the restaurant. It was 1:30pm already, too (sorry, 13:30), and the wait was an hour and a half. PEOPLE WERE WAITING A MINIMUM OF AN HOUR AND A HALF FOR A BURGER AND A LOBSTER ROLL. F*ck me.

Burger & Lobster only serves three things and they’re all $20: a burger, a grilled or steamed lobster, and a lobster roll. $20, not a bad deal for either a massive lobster roll or a big-ass lobster. In this day and age, it isn’t bad for fully stacked burger, either. Neither their burgers (Nebraska), nor their lobsters (Nova Scotia) hail from London, thankfully, so don’t worry about that.

the porky excessiveness of Ippudo and the basic, hangover curing magic of more
traditional spots like Rai Rai Ken. It's a chicken-based broth as opposed to pork, and
the noodles are thin. It all feels pretty authentic, and it's always
satisfying - especially if you can hit it for lunch.

Legend would have you believe that reasonably successful wordsmiths like Ernest Hemingway and E.E. Cummings frequented Minetta like their own clubhouse back in the day. Fact: booze has always fueled creativity. It’s no longer a writers’ haunt, that’s for sure, but the 21st-century iteration of Minetta Tavern is still a very special place.
Let’s backtrack to our first go-round at Minetta. The year was 2009, the same year we started writing restaurant reviews, and Minetta Tavern was by far and away the biggest restaurant opening of the year. Food media was completely enamored with the place. It was impossible to get in, they had a bouncer, and it was a MASSIVE deal that the “Black Label Burger” cost $26. These days, no one raises an eyebrow when burgers are on fancy restaurant menus, clocking in anywhere from $20-40. This is 1000% all Minetta Taven’s influence. We weren’t as in awe of Minetta like everyone else was, though. We liked it OK and felt like the hype outshined the actual restaurant experience. So we gave it a 7.7 rating.
Cut to 2015, and things done changed. Minetta is incredible these days. They’ve really hit their stride, and it’s everything we had hoped it would be back in 2009. The room has a special feeling that makes you feel f*cking fantastic, and the restaurant is Perfect For so many things. The bar is usually our move, because if you get there early, you can usually scoop a couple seats. Once settled, let it rip. Minetta’s bone marrow is mind blowing, and the Bone-In NY Strip is bananas. Plus, all that Black Label action. Straight up, Minetta Tavern is one of our absolute favorite restaurants. We can’t do it often, because then we’d be broke and really fat, but once or twice a year this is a treat-yo-self meat splurge you deserve. It’s also a sleeper for brunch, and if you want to get in without the hassle of trying to get a dinner reservation, just go for lunch and get a burger.
It took us a minute to find our happy place with Minetta, but we’re glad we realize how truly great this restaurant is now.

Well, much in this world has changed since 2011. We’ve ditched the word “Immaculate,” gone bi-coastal, and fallen in and out of lust with bone broth. And in that time, Dirt Candy has relocated to a larger and more polished venue downtown where the food is still very good and the logistics have gotten even better.
The biggest change? Size. Both restaurant and menu have expanded dramatically from their once scrappy, lean roots to an all-white, sprawling dining room featuring a bar and full, diverse menu.

We failed Intro to Econ, so we’re going to forgo developing an opinion on that one. But the change that will take getting used to is the space. We had a little Stockholm Syndrome as we familiarized ourselves with the shiny new sign and high ceilings.

Restaurant after restaurant started adding them to dishes, because they were fancy and exotic and all around announced that you were classy. Do you remember going to a restaurant in the '90s? There were SO MANY SUNDRIED TOMATOES.
Fortunately, the '90s are over and no one has to subsist on sundried tomato and goat cheese paninis anymore (NOT HATIN'). But there is a quickly rising sundried tomato of our time (or at least of hip New York restaurants in 2015). It is sea urchin.
A couple years ago, sea urchin, or uni, was mostly known around these parts as an ""exotic"" kind of sushi - the type that divides tables and makes people say, ""That looks like a tongue."" (It does look like a tongue.) But now, sea urchin's all over the place - and it seems like every new restaurant serves some kind of uni dish. I'm pretty sure there are at least nine Italian restaurants that opened in the past two years which serve pasta with sea urchin.
If you're the kind of person who gets psyched up about uni as if it were a Pokémon card (GOTTA CATCH 'EM ALL!), you'll definitely be excited by Sakamai, a Lower East Side Japanese sake bar where a pretty high proportion of the menu includes the ol' sea urchin gonads. The rest of the menu is filled out by other rich, delicacy kind of foods that elicit similar fan-girling: bone marrow, caviar, foie gras.
But despite the over the top ingredients, SakaMai is a pretty relaxed place. It looks like a typical Lower East Side wine bar, straight down to the sake that's served in wine glasses, and nearly all of the plates are small and designed for sharing. For the most part, the rich ingredients are mixed into familiar Japanese-inspired dishes like hand rolls, meatballs, and ramen noodles, so it's not like you're not going to be straight up eating a plate of sea urchin and bone marrow.
How much you like this place will largely depend on how much you like to get down with the ingredients described above. There are both fancier and dive-ier places to eat this kind of Japanese bar food, where the food may be slightly better or slightly cheaper, but SakaMai's a nice Date Night kind of middle ground, and a good respite from the surrounding wine bars.

And yet that's probably the extent of what the average New Yorker knows about them. For most of us, the word ""farm"" has really become more of an adjective than noun, used to imply that something is ""good"" or ""probably not covered with Doritos.""
""Excuse me, what's in the omelette?""
""Three farm eggs and heirloom tomatoes.""
""Farm eggs, you say? I do want that. And throw in some farm fresh asparagus.""
We also like our restaurants to be farm-centric whenever possible. That was certainly a factor that piqued our interest when we found out that The Finch, a new restaurant in Clinton Hill, is owned by a chef who spent time at Blue Hill at Stone Barns. He spent time in a lot of other restaurants too, but Stone Barns is by far our favorite farm, so TELL ME MORE.
The Finch actually makes no claim to being a particularly farm-centric or farm-focused dining establishment, but it definitely feels like one. The restaurant occupies the entire bottom floor of a brownstone on Greene Avenue, but also seems like it could just as easily exist in the Hudson Valley next to its very own grain silo.

Despite never actually using the word, the menu at The Finch definitely has a Blue Hill-esque ""farm"" feel to it, in that each dish is all about the quality of the ingredients, rather than relying on some rich sauce or heavy handed seasoning to make an impression. For instance, we found ourselves surprised but appreciative of the fact that our squid ink pasta tasted like squid ink pasta and not just starch with lemon juice and chili pepper and butter and salt. We also appreciate that we saw no evidence of what we'll call ""farm flexing,"" in which some rare strain of basil from the Triassic period shows up on your plate to impress you even though it does indeed taste like dinosaur. Instead the flavors are mostly familiar and restrained, and almost exclusively enjoyable.

God Bless America.",3.0,American,The Finch,8.3,"People love farms. Or at least they love the idea of them. Farms embody the spirit of the nation. Farms grow things that taste good. Farms have cool machines that sort of look like Transformers.
And yet that's probably the extent of what the average New Yorker knows about them. For most of us, the word ""farm"" has really become more of an adjective than noun, used to imply that something is ""good"" or ""probably not covered with Doritos.""
""Excuse me, what's in the omelette?""
""Three farm eggs and heirloom tomatoes.""
""Farm eggs, you say? I do want that. And throw in some farm fresh asparagus.""
We also like our restaurants to be farm-centric whenever possible. That was certainly a factor that piqued our interest when we found out that The Finch, a new restaurant in Clinton Hill, is owned by a chef who spent time at Blue Hill at Stone Barns. He spent time in a lot of other restaurants too, but Stone Barns is by far our favorite farm, so TELL ME MORE.
The Finch actually makes no claim to being a particularly farm-centric or farm-focused dining establishment, but it definitely feels like one. The restaurant occupies the entire bottom floor of a brownstone on Greene Avenue, but also seems like it could just as easily exist in the Hudson Valley next to its very own grain silo.

Do you love ramen?
Is Ippudo your favorite place to eat ramen?
Do you sometimes wonder what the effects of eating ramen several times a week would have on your well being?
Are you interested in learning more about Queens?
Have you ever been convicted of a felony?
Ok, you don’t have to answer that last one. I’m just trying to see what kind of creeps are out there reading our reviews. But if you found yourself responding in the affirmative to the first four queries, you should plan to pick up the phone at 3:00pm today and make a reservation for dinner tonight at Mu Ramen.

Really? Another ramen joint?
And I have to call at 3pm to get a same day reservation?
All the way out in Long Island City?
Why not just hit up any one of the 30 other ramen restaurants currently in my rotation?
Will there be a test?
These are all valid concerns, and I can address them all with one simple statement. Mu Ramen is one of the best ramen spots in New York City. We’d actually go as far as to say we like it almost as much as we like Ippudo, and we f*cking love Ippudo. In fact, the Tonkotsu Ramen on Mu’s menu was modeled after Ippudo’s famous Akamaru Modern, and it does a pretty damn good job of emulating that bowl of all bowls. But you shouldn’t come here just for that. If you want a bowl of Akamaru Modern, you know where to get one. You should come to Mu Ramen for everything else, from the excellent vibe in the 22 seat room, to friendly staff, to the incredibly creative and delicious dishes they call “Treats.”
The soup is also excellent, and it is actually different than the other stuff out there right now. Mu Ramen takes the fat out of their broth after it cools down and rises to the top. Most other Japanese ramen spots do not. The end result is a much cleaner taste that’s still rich and flavorful, and it might not make you want to die so much after eating it. The ramen here is also lighter on the salt, leaving the high quality ingredients to stand up on their own.
We appreciate that concern for our health, but what we appreciate most about Mu Ramen is just that it’s fun and different. The hype surrounding the place might have you believe otherwise, but this is really just a neighborhood restaurant that happens to be so good it’s worth traveling for.

People love to say, ""Hey, that'd be a great name for a band!"" but rarely, ""Hey, that'd be a great name for a restaurant."" As a result, most new restaurants end up being called something like ""The [Insert A Random Non-English Noun]"" or ""[Insert A Random Workshop Tool] & [Insert A Random Obscure Animal].""
So props to Houdini Kitchen Laboratory for having one of the best names in the restaurant business.
Before we made it there, we'd heard Houdini described as the new Roberta's and as the current ""spirit animal"" of Ridgewood. Fair enough. A few years ago, Roberta's, located where Williamsburg spills into Bushwick, became the poster child of Bushwick's growing restaurant scene. And Houdini, located where Bushwick spills into Ridgewood and crosses the border from Brooklyn to Queens (can we not call it Quooklyn, please?), holds a similar role as reigning pizza place hangout of the neighborhood.
But a sweet name and some parallels to a beloved spot with two hour waits does not a great restaurant make. Fortunately, Houdini has a lot more going for it. First and foremost, Houdini has great pizza - from a simple pie featuring some of the creamiest mozzarella we've ever witnessed to others topped with impressively fresh vegetables and quality cured meats.

As a result, most new restaurants end up being called something like ""The [Insert A Random Non-English Noun]"" or ""[Insert A Random Workshop Tool] & [Insert A Random Obscure Animal].""
So props to Houdini Kitchen Laboratory for having one of the best names in the restaurant business.
Before we made it there, we'd heard Houdini described as the new Roberta's and as the current ""spirit animal"" of Ridgewood. Fair enough. A few years ago, Roberta's, located where Williamsburg spills into Bushwick, became the poster child of Bushwick's growing restaurant scene. And Houdini, located where Bushwick spills into Ridgewood and crosses the border from Brooklyn to Queens (can we not call it Quooklyn, please?), holds a similar role as reigning pizza place hangout of the neighborhood.
But a sweet name and some parallels to a beloved spot with two hour waits does not a great restaurant make. Fortunately, Houdini has a lot more going for it. First and foremost, Houdini has great pizza - from a simple pie featuring some of the creamiest mozzarella we've ever witnessed to others topped with impressively fresh vegetables and quality cured meats.

This is true for many aspects of life, whether you’re prayin’ on a Powerball ticket, skipping medical school to “pursue your music,” or somehow still rooting for New York sports teams. It’s also very true for restaurants.
Cosme is about as highly anticipated as a restaurant gets in this town, with the speculation over when famed Mexico chef Enrique Olvera would open beginning more than a full year before they served a single plate. We were certainly excited to try it for many months before it became a real thing, but not necessarily because of the chef’s previous successes. We just happen to love Mexican food of all shapes, sizes, and culinary interpretations. Except, of course, Dos Caminos.
So what is Cosme, other than a seriously hyped restaurant? Well, let’s start with what it’s not. This isn’t some high end, “Parque De Eleven Madison” take on Mexican food. We were actually surprised at how simple the dishes are, even more so than a place like Empellon Cocina, but with a similarly inventive approach.

This is true for many aspects of life, whether you’re prayin’ on a Powerball ticket, skipping medical school to “pursue your music,” or somehow still rooting for New York sports teams. It’s also very true for restaurants.
Cosme is about as highly anticipated as a restaurant gets in this town, with the speculation over when famed Mexico chef Enrique Olvera would open beginning more than a full year before they served a single plate. We were certainly excited to try it for many months before it became a real thing, but not necessarily because of the chef’s previous successes. We just happen to love Mexican food of all shapes, sizes, and culinary interpretations. Except, of course, Dos Caminos.
So what is Cosme, other than a seriously hyped restaurant? Well, let’s start with what it’s not. This isn’t some high end, “Parque De Eleven Madison” take on Mexican food.

If you want to have a really good meal at Community, avoid it during prime time all together.

Why in the world would one even want to ""beet cure"" an otherwise perfectly good piece of salmon? Would Black Seed Bagels even exist if Instagram did not? What else is Canada trying to steal from us?
These are the questions that we imagine being asked if someone were to convene a summit of New York's most respected bagel experts. Since no such summit has been proposed (and since everyone in this town is apparently an expert), we'll take a stab at the answers: no such thing, because it tastes good, probably not, and freedom.
Now that that's been settled, let's have a simple conversation about Black Seed Bagels.

They've been called ""perfect,"" ""ambitious,"" and ""the best"" by many people who describe food for a living. We're not ready to go that far, but we can confirm for the few among you who haven't had one that they are excellent.

During the day, this tiny 12-seat house of chopstick heaven is home to Okonomi, in which they serve a traditional Japanese set meal called “Ichiju Sansai.” At night, the space gets taken over by Yuji Ramen, one of the best, most unique noodle joints that exists in this fine city filled with ramen. Before we get into why you need to eat here immediately and explain the best plan of attack, let’s get into some of the backstory, because that part is important.
Chef Yuji Haraguchi had never worked in a professional kitchen before he was hired as a prep cook at Roberta’s a few years back by Tara Norvell, his eventual business partner. Yuji wound up cooking ramen for staff meal a lot, and every time he did it, people were blown away. Turns out, Yuji WAS A FREAK IN THE KITCHEN. Yuji and Tara decided to pop up with his unique brothless ramen, otherwise known as mazemen, at Smorgasburg on the regular. Yuji became the toast of Smorg, which then led to a permanent pop-up space on the second-floor food court of the Whole Foods on Bowery. Yuji Ramen served Yuji’s brothless ramen creations all day, and then at night, he offered a one-of-a kind, 16-seat, impossible to get into tasting menu. We went. It was silly. The hype was full throttle, and it was all warranted.
When you have sufficiently generated this kind of buzz and then open your first ever brick-and-mortar location, which is what Okonomi is, you’d think it’d be a food media frenzy, right? Well, that hasn’t exactly been the case. It’s been kind of quiet, which is surprising to us. We’re here today to make sure Okonomi/Yuji Ramen gets on your hit list immediately, because it’s one of the most exciting restaurants in NYC.
For breakfast and lunch at Okonomi, they take you straight to Tokyo, serving the supremely delicious, traditional “Ichiju Sansai” meal, which consists of a rice bowl, a miso soup, a piece of cooked fish, and three small sides. It’s light, it’s healthy, and it’s very affordable, coming in at $12 per person. After lunch, they proceed to throw all the leftover fish and excess bones into big pots to start cooking that night’s ramen broth. Yuji Ramen is open Sunday-Thursday evenings, while on Friday and Saturday nights, they do a new version of the tasting menu for which they became famous - to get a seat, you need to book a month out. Considering there are only 12 seats, you will likely have to wait regardless of when you come, but they move quickly, and The Blind Barber is right next door, so you can go and get a coffee during the day, or a beer at night, until your table is ready.

If it’s been a while, you might find yourself wondering, “What’s different?” on your next visit, as you eat crab toast amongst a room full of people who also love Pinterest.
After nearly five years in business, not much on the surface has changed at this well-regarded restaurant. It’s still rustic, it’s still pretty, and it’s still crowded. But it’s also definitely not the same as it used to be - specifically when it comes to the food. All of the most popular ABC Kitchen items are still featured on the menu, as are the expected rotation of highly seasonal vegetable dishes. But the quality has deteriorated since chef Dan Kluger left. And that’s why we’re here with an updated review.
Before we go too far down the rabbit hole, let’s be clear that ABC Kitchen is still a good restaurant. If you’re looking for a Date Night destination or place to take someone who is good at business in the Union Square area, this is a decent option. The staff is nice, and the atmosphere is tough to beat. But it simply isn’t among the best of the best in this city anymore. And I think I have an explanation as to why.
ABC Kitchen is a Jean-Georges restaurant. His name is listed first at the bottom of the menu, with the title of “Chef/Proprietor.” But we all know that he’s not anywhere near this kitchen most of the time. As a matter of fact, I saw the dude in Miami not all that long ago, roaming the floor at one of his new hotel cafes.

If it’s been a while, you might find yourself wondering, “What’s different?” on your next visit, as you eat crab toast amongst a room full of people who also love Pinterest.
After nearly five years in business, not much on the surface has changed at this well-regarded restaurant. It’s still rustic, it’s still pretty, and it’s still crowded. But it’s also definitely not the same as it used to be - specifically when it comes to the food. All of the most popular ABC Kitchen items are still featured on the menu, as are the expected rotation of highly seasonal vegetable dishes. But the quality has deteriorated since chef Dan Kluger left. And that’s why we’re here with an updated review.
Before we go too far down the rabbit hole, let’s be clear that ABC Kitchen is still a good restaurant. If you’re looking for a Date Night destination or place to take someone who is good at business in the Union Square area, this is a decent option. The staff is nice, and the atmosphere is tough to beat. But it simply isn’t among the best of the best in this city anymore. And I think I have an explanation as to why.
ABC Kitchen is a Jean-Georges restaurant. His name is listed first at the bottom of the menu, with the title of “Chef/Proprietor.” But we all know that he’s not anywhere near this kitchen most of the time. As a matter of fact, I saw the dude in Miami not all that long ago, roaming the floor at one of his new hotel cafes.

A block down, we were quoted a wait: 90 minutes. We tried again a week later, just before noon on a Sunday. An hour wait.
Egg Shop has all the elements of a popular weekend brunch venue: a Nolita location, a brightly-appointed space, and a menu largely centered around oozing yolks, avocado, bacon, and bloody marys. It also happens to be quite small, which contributes to the long lines.
Anyway, spoiler alert: we finally went to Egg Shop (on a dreary Monday right before Christmas) and very much liked it.

When you mention ramen, people tend to freak out. Ramen makes people feel alive! Ramen gives people purpose. Ramen makes people yell “OMG” and use prayer hands emojis. And rightfully so. Ramen, like Beyoncé, is great. But it can also be a lot to take in. Ramen hotspots like Ippudo are like Beyoncé concerts: they’re a challenge to get into, and they’re a little overwhelming.

So think of soba as the Solange of the Japanese noodle world. Soba doesn’t incite quite the mania that ramen does, but the noodles are also excellent. They’re just a little more underground.

The process is called “soba yu,” and it’s like multiple meals in one. It’s fun, interactive, and delicious.
For traditionalists, there’s also cold soba served with various mix-ins and a selection of noodle soups. And while soba may be the main attraction, the tofu appetizer and some of the desserts are destination-worthy as well.

Normally, the answer would be that one has food and one does not, but these days the lines are blurry. Terroir is a wine bar, but they also have an excellent menu of things to eat while you drink. I think Corkbuzz is a wine bar, but the newest location has inexplicably been at the top of the Eater Heatmap for the last three months, so it must be a restaurant. I know Bar Veloce is a wine bar because I've only been there with a visitor from out of town, a date, or a group of girls who are overdressed for a Wednesday night. And let's be honest, those are the scenarios in which you most typically find yourself at a wine bar.
As for Terra, I could go either way. Part of me thinks this new Tribeca spot is a wine bar, because it's owned and operated by the same people responsible for Aria, the West Village's most rustic and hilarious place to drink Nebbiolo. But I also sort of think it's a restaurant, because of the fact that they have a huge kitchen that turns out fresh pasta and all of the other 47 things on their menu. The question then becomes, who cares what you call it?
The short answer, is I do. Because I don't think you can call yourself a wine bar and then have poor options when it comes to wine. And before you fire up an email to me about how I probably don't know anything about wine and probably don't even know that Chianti can be really great, a) I get it and b) that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the fact that the cheapest decent bottle here is in the $70 range, and it's not even one of those good value situations. The wine list here is just way too expensive.
So maybe it's just a restaurant then. How's the food? Pretty solid actually. Especially if you lean heavy on the small plates portion of the menu, going big on things like fried artichokes and meatballs. The pastas are decent too, but not worthy of many more words on the subject. So, if Terra is a restaurant, it's an average one. And still an expensive one.
The one thing we will say definitively about this place is that the room is amazing. It's dark, rustic, filled with candles, and even has great space for a big group and outdoor dining in the warmer months. So maybe it's neither a wine bar nor a restaurant.

Plenty of hotels have restaurants inside them, but they’re usually separate entities that have their own identities.

Feel is such an important element to dining out (see, The Feel Good Factor™). Some restaurants have got it going on and others simply don’t. Unfortunately, Marta does not. We’re weighing so heavily on the room here because it’s always such a key component to the Danny Meyer hospitality experience. If anyone knows how important that special feeling is, it’s Meyer, who we have a lot of respect for. Maybe because this one was just a pizza joint, he let that part slide, but this place doesn’t feel like everything else he’s done.
What Marta does have going on are some pretty damn tasty Roman-style pizzas, and a roster of other stuffed and fried things to eat before you get to the main event. The food is definitely delicious - there’s no question about that - but it also isn’t good enough to make us go out of our way to come back.

The fact that right now, at this very minute, someone, somewhere (probably in Britain) is buying tickets to see Queen with Adam Lambert.

That’s not Queen. That’s Queen karaoke.
Now, before word makes it to the “Glamberts” that I’ve slandered their king, and before the virtual pitchforks come out, let me make myself clear. I absolutely do think that Adam Lambert sucks. But I am making that point here in this restaurant review for a reason. You see, in most situations, be it music, sports, or television, you cannot have a significant core lineup change and simply carry on as though everything remains the same.

Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria recently had a pretty significant lineup change of its own, when their longtime chef left to open a new establishment with Stephen Starr, the restaurant industry’s Simon Cowell. Being that this place has been in our regular rotation ever since we first reviewed it back in 2011, this was a concerning development. We generally dislike change, especially when it relates to whether or not short rib sandwiches will be available to us for lunch. As a result, we’ve been back to Il Buco AV several (seven) times over the last few months to see what’s changed with a new lead singer at the helm, sure to be bummed out by a bunch of Adam Lambert interpretations of their greatest hits.But here’s the thing. That’s not what happened at all. Believe it or not, Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria has somehow gotten better with the new lineup. The key classics are all there - short rib sandwiches and excellent pasta included. But there are also some new dishes that impressed us in a way that nothing on the previous menu ever did - like roasted quail in a white chocolate sauce or a simple but incredible little gem salad. It almost feels as though there’s some California influence on this menu now, or maybe that’s just what eating fresh greens instead of brussels sprouts tells me. Either way, I like it.
Even with the new improvements, Il Buco is not a perfect restaurant - it’s always packed to the gills during dinner, and the communal seating situation will likely make your meal a social engagement with the strangers around you,
whether you’re into that sort of thing or not. Regardless, this is still one of the best restaurants in this city, and it’s perfectly reasonable to hit it for brunch or lunch if you can’t get in for dinner.

But it’s not regulated because NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT IS. The recipe is secret and it’s not for sale. We’ve asked.
Green sauce seems to bring people back - and Mooncake has built a small empire on it, with three other locations in the Financial District, Hell’s Kitchen, and Chelsea.

All meals at Mooncake should revolve around the restaurant’s signature spicy green sauce, which is kind of like a tangier, more aesthetically-pleasing Sriracha addictive enough it should possibly be regulated as a controlled substance. But it’s not regulated because NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT IS. The recipe is secret and it’s not for sale. We’ve asked.
Green sauce seems to bring people back - and Mooncake has built a small empire on it, with three other locations in the Financial District, Hell’s Kitchen, and Chelsea. We can’t attest to the quality of cool, weird diner vibes at the other locations, but we can attest to the fact that they have the green sauce, and to the fact that they will deliver to your doorstep. Not always promptly, but as you should know by now: Mooncake is not like most restaurants.
So stop worrying about how to explain this place to your friends, and get to this corner of Soho you probably forgot existed and get to this weird little Asian diner you never knew you needed.","28 Watts St., New York, NY 10013",Manhattan,10013,explaining mooncake food newcomer present something challenge sort vaguely healthy asian food healthy organic green juice kind way soho part old guy selling old movie script bad painting street also kind look like greasy spoon diner good way everything mooncake food basically follows good way formula includes impossible pin clientele last weekday evening visit patron pair french girl shared order dumpling cheap glass wine guy sitting alone leather jacket good way go alone sit counter go friend sit window cold winter day go group mooncake rule except one rule green sauce meal mooncake revolve around restaurant signature spicy green sauce kind like tangier aesthetically pleasing sriracha addictive enough possibly regulated controlled substance regulated nobody know recipe secret sale asked green sauce seems bring people back mooncake built small empire three location financial district hell kitchen chelsea attest quality cool weird diner vibe location attest fact green sauce fact deliver doorstep always promptly know mooncake like restaurant stop worrying explain place friend get corner soho probably forgot existed get weird little asian diner never knew needed,"(40.7236422, -74.0043549)",40.7236422,-74.0043549

Unlike the East Villages and NoHos of the world, the Upper West is a challenging place to find a good, quick, and not completely overpriced lunch outside of the Chipotle and Lenny's rotation. I’m not proud of those being in my mix, but if you work or live up here, you know how hard it can be to find variety. And variety is where Blossom du Jour excels.
Stating the obvious, but nearly everything on the menu at Blossom du Jour is pretty good for you and 100% vegan friendly. And no matter what you're in the mood for - a funky smoothie, a savory sandwich, or a super fresh salad -Blossom has you covered. Even non-vegan folks like myself who occasionally dabble in the dark art of consuming meatless meals will be satisfied by their “tuna” melt, “meatball” sub, and burrito.
Know that only some of the locations - Blossom is also in Chelsea and Midtown West - have counter space where you can sit, and this particular location is take-out only.

The room is packed with big, boozy groups, the menu is full of fresh seafood, and the bar has Abita on tap. You order shellfish by the pound and Cajun seasoning can be found on pretty much everything. Hell, there's even a fleur-de-lis on the wall, and I'm pretty sure those can't leave the city unless the NoLa mayor officially signs off on it.
Oh, you can buy those anywhere? They sell them in those year round Halloween stores, for no apparent reason? There are like 400 girls in Maryland that have a fleur-de-lis tattoo because it looked cool and they were drunk in Ocean City? My bad. That's good to know. Because New Orleans is a dream. And The Boil kind of sucks.
The menu at The Boil will have you ordering crawfish, shrimp, lobster, and crab by the pound, with your choice of sauce and heat. It's a perfect blueprint for hands on eating with a side of beer - except just about none of it works. The seafood itself is decent, and eating out of a garbage bag is fun, but everything else is a step in the wrong direction. The garlic butter sauce is thick and overpowering, masking the taste of the seafood. And the heat index is a joke. The hottest level (""fire"") is sadly unintimidating, even if the waitstaff acts like an order of it will leave you seizing on the floor.
The only way to do The Boil right is to ignore all the bells and whistles (and asterisks on the menu) and go with seafood in Old Bay. Full stop. Two pounds of shrimp with nothing but Old Bay is a legit meal here. Ditto the crab and fries. The problem is, waiting over an hour to eat Cajun fries isn't much of a setup.

And it’s actually the thing that makes you want to go back to a certain restaurant. It’s not the food, it’s not the service, it’s not whether or not they have upscale tater tots on the menu. It’s the FGF, and if you own an eating establishment of any kind, it’s the secret to creating a successful business.
Why doesn’t anybody talk about The Feel Good Factor™? Mostly because we’ll litigate. It cost us a lot of money to register a trademark for the sole purpose of this review, and we intend to defend against any and all infringement with fervor. But also because it’s a hard thing to quantify. To be honest, we probably couldn’t tell you what the exact equation for exceptionally high FGF is. We can only tell you whether or not a certain place has it. And Meadowsweet absolutely does.
Meadowsweet is the new restaurant in the space that was once home to Brooklyn favorite Dressler, brought to you by the one-time chef of Dressler. It was recently awarded a Michelin star, which we suppose is an indication that someone (besides us) likes it here. But stars don’t tell much of a story. And they certainly don’t make you feel good.
What does make you feel good is when you’re eating a plate of something awesome while sitting in a comfortable chair in a nicely appointed room and then The Rolling Stones' “Monkey Man” comes on over the speakers. Or when you order a bottle of wine, and they realize that they’ve run out of it but then recommend something that turns out to be even better. It’s that moment that you realize that a place has enough intangible positive qualities that you’re willing to forgive a dish that’s too salty because f*ck it, I feel good, and I have water. That’s the Feel Good Factor™ in a nutshell, and all of those things are happening at this restaurant.

Despite being fully in love with pre-made poultry, rotisserie chicken still makes us think of sad single dudes eating in their underwear. And for the most part, Hell's Kitchen makes us think of the same thing. There's something perfect about a rotisserie bird, it's just not one of the classier, cuter meals around. Unless you're part of a small subset of Craigslist creeps out there, it's rare for a nice dinner to involve ripping bones apart with your hands and sucking salty skin-grease off your fingers one by one.
But Poulette kinda sorta almost changes that.
It's not that Poulette has reinvented the rotisserie chicken. In fact, the meal is pretty much exactly what you've come to expect from your heat lamp'd grocery display. But somewhere between the veggie sides, the dining area, and overall presentation (bye-bye chicken in a bag, helloooo chicken in a box), Poulette successfully scales up the entire rotisserie experience.
The space is nice, with a few countertops and stools. Nothing shmance, but it's clean, which sets it apart from most places on Ninth Avenue. And most importantly, it's a step above your couch and Boston Market, which is where a lot of rotisserie meals are consumed. This added touch of class is a welcome change - but it comes at a price. While Whole Foods and Fairway sell a full bird for around $8-10, Poulette asks $17.75 for its version. It markets each chicken as a plump and organic 3-pounder, but even still, that's steep for what is supposed to be a cheap option. Regardless, there are deals to be had and our go-to is the $17 half bird meal, which comes with your choice of two sides, almost all of which are excellent.

everyone else, still visit quite a bit. And now that the hype has died down
and the media is focused on whatever Mario C, Rich T and MC Z are working on
next, we decided to check back in, reassess, and refresh our review.
Not much has changed at Parm since it opened back in 2011, other than the fact
that there is one at Yankee Stadium, and there are probably about to be a lot
more of them around the city and ultimately the country. It would seem that
the intent is to ""Shake Shack"" this thing, and yes, now that's a verb. That's
what happens when your restaurant chain is valued at a billion dollars. So the
fact that sandwiches are just as good as they've always been probably bodes
well for this group's plans to Parm the USA.

Parm that probably earns them some favor that menu outside of sandwiches
doesn't, and that's perfectly fine. If you stick to the superstar items (as
detailed in the Food Rundown), you'll definitely enjoy your meal, and you'll

I was new to the city and highly interested in restaurants, and I often found myself frustrated when trying to sort through my options. Why?
Let’s take New York Magazine for example. Back then, their restaurant listings were relegated to the back of the book, and space limitations basically allowed for about three sentences worth of copy to summarize each place. And you know what made me crazy? The fact that two of those sentences were almost always devoted to calling out the credentials of some chef that I’d never heard of. That information simply wasn’t relevant or useful to me. I just wanted to know whether or not I should spend what little money I had on a meal there.
Ultimately, that frustration is what led us to start The (Immaculate) Infatuation, and here we are today. What’s funny is that for all that has changed since 2002, when it comes to food media, very much is the same. Most of the people covering this stuff still focus on the “who” rather than the “why.”
The “why” is what brings us to today’s review. I have absolutely no idea who the chef of The Eddy is. None. I don’t know where he or she trained, I don’t know who his or her mentors are, and I know nothing of the philosophy that this person brings to the kitchen. What I do know is that I love this restaurant, and I think you will, too. Here are the reasons.
The Eddy is a tiny little place, but it has a ton of New York charm. This is one of those restaurants that you sit in on a snowy Friday night and order a second bottle of wine because f*ck it, you own this town, and nobody is waking you up early tomorrow. It’s also Perfect For any type of date, especially one with four people because you’ll be guaranteed a bigger table and a bit more room to make charming hand gestures (never fails). The good news is that regardless of where you sit, the service will be excellent. For an East Village restaurant, this is a pretty upscale experience, and the staff is trained accordingly. The wine list is serious but affordable and accessible, and the details have been attended to - like nice glassware and a bottle that’s served at the right temperature.
As for the food, the menu is your choice of a $65 tasting or a la carte. We recommend the order-at-will approach, but the tasting is a good move if you want to spend less time thinking (and more time hand gesturing). You will see some bar snacks listed, but make no mistake - this menu is advanced. You probably don’t want to bring a picky friend, but you definitely do want to bring a friend that would be into eating some beef tendon puff or having some chicken skin mixed in with the burrata.

Our initial reaction upon discovering this cool British pub and restaurant was to be pleasantly surprised that something like this could exist on the Upper East Side and not just be another ridiculous dive called The Fox and The Hound or Queen Mary’s Banger House. You know the type of place - the Union Jack on the wall and Guinness on tap and some guy who is hammered at 2pm pretending to give a sh*t about soccer. Jones Wood Foundry is far better and far more authentic than that. The food here is excellent. And their drunk guys really do care about soccer.
But what we’ve come to realize over time is that the beauty of Jones Wood Foundry is not simply in the fact that this a better British pub than most in this city. What makes it unique is that this is also an excellent utility restaurant for just about every need an Upper East Side resident might have. Looking to watch Premiere League at 10am? You can do it here. Need a spot to bring your buddy from Chicago who loves to hang out and eat well but hates trendy places? This is your spot. Looking for brunch outside on a nice summer afternoon? The small patio at Jones Wood Foundry is almost always available. You can even hold a big group event here if you want to, assuming everyone can get down with the fact that there’s no liquor behind the bar. Your aunt probably needs to lay off the vodka martinis anyway.
For us, we find Jones Wood Foundry most useful for some daytime eating. We hit it frequently for brunch after a run in Central Park, or anytime we want to get food on a Saturday afternoon and not deal with people who go to brunch. Dinner is good, too, especially if you’re having the Meyers of Keswick Bangers & Mash with a Woodland Mushroom Salad on the side.

dead time in the city, when very few restaurants are open and most of the
locals are holed up in their apartments, probably rolling all their cigarettes
for the coming year or something. But it's also a cool time to be there,
because it forces you into the tiny corners of the neighborhoods to find good
food.
It also might make you find some other interesting things, which was true for
us when we found, on a random late December night, completely by accident, a
man named Pierre Jancou, manning a completely empty wine bar. We sat down
expecting to have a glass or two and somehow ended up having one of the
greatest nights ever, drinking wine, listening to music, and discussing food
with Pierre while he spontaneously cooked us pasta on a hot plate with
ingredients he happened to have on hand. What we hadn't known when we walked
in is that Pierre is something of a Parisian restaurant legend (who also
happened to own the wine bar and adjacent restaurant, Vivant). He's also very
good at pouring wine. I missed my Eurostar the next morning.
What made Pierre a legend, aside from the fact that he sort of looks like what
Jude Law might look like if Jude Law wasn't such a pussy, is
a restaurant he opened in 2008 called Racines. Racines is and was a tiny
little place in the 2nd, built on Pierre's passion for all natural wines (no
sulfur) and simple, local ingredients from small producers. Jancou sold
Racines a few years later, and along with it, the rights to use the name and
open a location in New York.
The reason I spent all of that time telling you that story, is because I think
it will help you appreciate this new Racines in Tribeca more. Pierre the
Parisian wine legend hasn't been involved with the place for some time, but
both restaurants still carry some of his philosophy, i.e. natural wines and
simple food. You'll want to drink at this new Racines, and you'll probably
want to drink a lot, because the wine list is excellent and surprisingly
affordable. You'll also want to eat, and the food at Racines New York is
impressive. It would be a mistake to assume that this is just another wine bar
in a neighborhood that definitely doesn't need another wine bar. This is one
of the better places to eat in Tribeca.
Aside from the food and the wine list, I think what impressed us the most
about Racines is how much the staff here care and also knows their sh*t, but
not in a stuffy way. It's just as good of a spot for a date as it is for a
laid back (albeit pricey) weeknight meal, especially if you elect to sit at
the chef's counter - which you should. The menu changes frequently and is
fairly upscale, but this is also a place you can roll into for a good glass of

Between Tanoshi Sushi and now Yefsi, we're gonna start lobbying the MTA for a York Avenue subway soon. It will run the entire 30 block stretch of York, cost roughly 17 billion dollars, and will be useful to only a very small percentage of the population, two decades from now. And that's exactly why it will probably get approved.
Until that day comes, you'll have to take a taxi all the way to the east side of the island to eat at Yefsi, but we think that's something you should do. At least, that is, assuming you get down with Greek food. We certainly do, and so do our Greek friends who introduced us to this place recently.
Yefsi is one of those Upper East Side restaurants that you usually walk by and wonder who eats there, assuming you notice it at all. It's a non-descript room that looks like it came out of the ""So You Want to Open an Upscale Restaurant"" handbook from ten years ago, meaning there are lots of wood finishes and halogen lights, and I'm pretty sure the host checked in my reservation on a Gateway. But what Yefsi lacks in aesthetic personality, it makes up for with excellent food. For all of the disappointing modern Greek restaurants that we've been to, Yefsi is one of the few to get it right.

Between Tanoshi Sushi and now Yefsi, we're gonna start lobbying the MTA for a York Avenue subway soon. It will run the entire 30 block stretch of York, cost roughly 17 billion dollars, and will be useful to only a very small percentage of the population, two decades from now. And that's exactly why it will probably get approved.
Until that day comes, you'll have to take a taxi all the way to the east side of the island to eat at Yefsi, but we think that's something you should do. At least, that is, assuming you get down with Greek food. We certainly do, and so do our Greek friends who introduced us to this place recently.
Yefsi is one of those Upper East Side restaurants that you usually walk by and wonder who eats there, assuming you notice it at all. It's a non-descript room that looks like it came out of the ""So You Want to Open an Upscale Restaurant"" handbook from ten years ago, meaning there are lots of wood finishes and halogen lights, and I'm pretty sure the host checked in my reservation on a Gateway. But what Yefsi lacks in aesthetic personality, it makes up for with excellent food. For all of the disappointing modern Greek restaurants that we've been to, Yefsi is one of the few to get it right.

And in many ways, it was for good reason. We, like pretty much everyone else, have always loved Mary's famous lobster roll and the restaurant's beach-shack-in-the-village vibe. But with age, Mary's has developed some flaws, so it's time for a re-review, to reset expectations.
The dishes Mary's is known for are still worth the hype. The aforementioned lobster roll is amazing, assuming you can get down with the mayo-heavy variety. The mussels are always fresh and delicious. We love the oyster Po' Boy, too.
But there are not so great things on this menu that we need to talk about -like the fish tacos. You could roll up some deep fried Montauk Monster into a taco and I'd probably eat it. But at Mary's, the only flavorful thing about their fish taco is the corn salad that comes on the side. Then there's the spicy and citrusy shrimp burger that falls apart like a misunderstood quinoa patty the second you take a bite. And over time, we've found the chalk board specials to be hit or miss. So, unless you spy something irresistible on a neighboring table, we recommend sticking to the main menu.
Beyond the food, we highly recommend avoiding Mary's for dinner. It is incredibly hectic with tables so close together, you'll be swimming in your neighbor's chowder before you even look at the menu. I selfishly think the drink list is great because Red Stripe is my favorite beer, but otherwise the options are very mediocre. And no matter how quickly you order and eat, you'll feel like both the hostess and wait staff hate you the entire time you're there. That is until they kick you out as soon as you ask for your check, at which point you will know for sure.

We educated ourselves to know that the broth would be more subtle, and the hand-pulled noodles more central to the experience.
But just because we went in with an open mind and adjusted expectations doesn't mean we had to love the bowls in front of us. The noodles at Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen are excellent (almost as excellent as the name) but the broth and meat were just so...boring...that it was hard to fall in love with the ramen here, or even develop a nonsexual crush on it. Quite frankly, we wouldn't even swipe right on the new app that matches you up with various available soups in New York City (patent pending) if this stuff popped up on it.
Then again, that 7.3 rating you see on this review means that something had to have worked, and something did indeed. After the ramen was cleared away and our tears of disappointment dried up, our meal at Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen was actually really good. The other menu items - soup dumplings, scallion pancakes with beef, lo mein-style dishes - were fantastic. So much so that this place has jumped straight to the top of our Late Night Eats Hit List for Midtown, right up there with Sake Bar Hagi. There is, however, one caveat.

We educated ourselves to know that the broth would be more subtle, and the hand-pulled noodles more central to the experience.
But just because we went in with an open mind and adjusted expectations doesn't mean we had to love the bowls in front of us. The noodles at Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen are excellent (almost as excellent as the name) but the broth and meat were just so...boring...that it was hard to fall in love with the ramen here, or even develop a nonsexual crush on it. Quite frankly, we wouldn't even swipe right on the new app that matches you up with various available soups in New York City (patent pending) if this stuff popped up on it.
Then again, that 7.3 rating you see on this review means that something had to have worked, and something did indeed. After the ramen was cleared away and our tears of disappointment dried up, our meal at Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen was actually really good. The other menu items - soup dumplings, scallion pancakes with beef, lo mein-style dishes - were fantastic. So much so that this place has jumped straight to the top of our Late Night Eats Hit List for Midtown, right up there with Sake Bar Hagi. There is, however, one caveat.

For all we talk about in terms of our oldest reviews needing updating, there are some restaurants that simply don’t change. Extra Virgin is one of them.

I think what we appreciate most about Extra Virgin is its consistency. Is this the best restaurant in the West Village? No, it isn’t. Do they use too much butter in many of the dishes?

I know that when I walk into Extra Virgin on any given night that it will be packed but that I can likely find a seat at the bar, and that whatever I decide to eat, I’m going to enjoy it.

Regardless of what time you go or how long you have to wait for your hot handful of beef and bun and American glory, Burger Joint is always a smart move. It will forever have a place in The Infatuation Hall of Fame and should also be added to the short list of dining establishments that every visitor to this city must experience before being allowed out of Midtown.

And as a proud child of a summer camp in the Blue Ridge Mountains and Wake Forest University in tobacco country, I feel morally obligated to proclaim: THIS is what the Southern cookin’ and eatin’ experience is supposed to look like.
First of all, if you’ve been to Elsa (RIP), The Cardinal, or both, Root & Bone captures the perfect cross between those two awesome East Village joints. Laid back and small, yet classy. Reasonably priced and casual, yet impressive in delivery.
But most importantly, the food is excellent. For example, the Southern Greens Caesar salad is like a regular caesar salad that went to Buddha school, achieved Nirvana, then came back and decided we were worthy of enlightenment. Even the things at this new restaurant that aren’t perfect - like the cheddar waffles - are so good that we ate them like they were free. Meaning quickly and with gusto.
Then there’s the fried chicken basket. It will stay with me forever. On my hips and in my heart. There’s so much to say, but in short, f*ck locally sourced chickens. The only chickens I ever want to spend time with from here on out must come from the South and have been bathed in sweet tea since hatch. And with that glorious chicken comes a sauce that I firmly believe is the elixir of life disguised as a condiment. As soon as I discovered it, it was all I could taste, see or want. It’s hot sauce meets honey meets... that’s about when I blacked out.
Of course, Root & Bone is still quite new. So it’s no surprise that we found one slight flaw. You see, I consider myself a mac and cheese connoisseur and was a bit disappointed in what Root & Bone brought to the table on that front. It reminded me a lot of the stuff I used to get at summer camp, which was great because the cheese was kind of grainy, and it efficiently carbo-loaded you for post-dinner capture-the-flag. But at a restaurant where everything else is on another level, I expected more.
So with a few growing pains on the menu and an incredibly long wait, Root and Bone is by no means perfect.

I guess we were just expecting something bigger.
Either way, Grand Banks is a fun little spot with really good oysters and other small plates, and some good drinks to match.

terrible cover band playing U2 songs inside the restaurant while we were
attempting to eat an expensive meal. Talk about killing a vibe...jesus.

wanna-be suburban punk, and Rancid remains one of my favorite bands of all time. But a) U2 sucks, and b) the only time a U2 cover band is acceptable during dinner is at the wedding of some other dude who plays in a U2 cover band. Period.

We love the energy. We love being comfortably uncomfortable in the stools. We love that our water glass never gets past half empty before being filled. And most of all, we love the f*cking food.

But those people seem to have been phased out in favor of more reasonable human beings that better handle the pressure of serving sandwiches to Europeans and crusty Upper East Siders. The last five or so times we have been by have been shockingly pleasant, even despite the crowds and cramped quarters.
The food at Via Quadronno has always been good, so nothing has changed on that front. It’s also stupid expensive, to the tune of lunch for two setting you back $50 no matter what.

We could go with the fact that for most New Yorkers, ""dinner and a show"" means a semi-overpriced Italian joint and a revival musical somewhere in the West 40s, not a Russian banquet, fire throwing, and line dancing. Or we could talk about how a meal at Tatiana is akin to a blind taste test, given that you can't reeeally see what you are eating about 80% of the time that a dish is served. Or we could discuss how the Wall of Fame down by the bathrooms has over 40 framed pictures, and that we can name all of two of the famous people being celebrated - Oksana Baiul and that guy from one of those movies...we think.
So to avoid having to make a choice, let's just go with all of the above. Tatiana is a complete sh*t show and one of the most bizarrely entertaining nights you will find in a town full of bizarrely entertaining options. Bordering a stretch of the boardwalk, Tatiana's outdoor seating spills out onto the strip. But the main event takes place inside, where your meal is accompanied by a very home-cooked show featuring dancers, singers, ""trapeze"" artists, and a shirtless 40-year old who pops up during a few different acts. How many dinners have you been to that ended with a light show and unison clapping from the entire dining room? We thought so.
And then there is the food. The grub essentially serves the purpose of letting you drink without getting the spins. With that in mind, you can come and order a la carte, but this place is known for its banquet style meals from Friday-Sunday. You'll need numbers for this option, so round up your closest and least judgmental friends. Here's a litmus test: Anybody who is embarrassed at karaoke is out; anybody who runs to the center of the wedding dance floor to lift the bride on a chair despite being a +1 and not knowing anybody there is IN. Head for Little Russia, and prepare to sit back and be served platter after platter, worrying less about the menu and more about the women dancing inside giant picture frames.
Major Pro Tip: This place is not BYOB but the waiters have been known to let a few outside bottles slide. That said, if you're rolling deep, you may be able to make arrangements with the reservationist ahead of time to bring in your own.

Getting older means we are expected to attend more grown up celebrations (black tie weddings, baby showers, dog naming ceremonies), but at the end of the day, all anybody reeeaaallly wants is to hit up a pizza and ice cream party. And this is coming from a high-ranking member of the tribe of lactose intolerance. So, it is with great fanfare and noisemakers that we invite you to one of the city’s best pizza and ice cream parties - a meal out at L&B Spumoni Gardens.
If you’ve never been, understand that the pizza and ice cream served at L&B are a bit different from what you’re used to.
First of all, let’s talk about the pizza. For all the special slices New York has to offer, you won’t often find us ranting and raving about the Sicilian. Walk into any run-of-the-mill pizzeria and chances are good that its Sicilian square pales in comparison to the standard foldable slice we New Yorkers hold so near and dear. But L&B is slanging square slices that stand up to the top triangles in town. They’re even so dedicated to the craft that they call a normal slice a “round slice.” Go ahead and walk into Joe’s sometime and order a round slice. Odds are you’ll get slapped before you get served. And unlike some of Brooklyn’s other famed pizzerias, L&B won’t make you wait three hours for your food. Pies come out of the kitchen in a normal, humane amount of time.
From there, we have the ice cream, which isn’t even really ice cream, but spumoni. Spumoni is a sort of ice cream/Italian ice hybrid, with small bits of nuts and sometimes fruit mixed in. It’s lighter than Ben and Jerry’s, and a welcome change from your usual cone. Never had it? There’s no better place to make your introduction than Spumoni Gardens.
Between the two of those beautiful things, the sidewalk seating here is always packed with local families on weekend afternoons and teenagers once the sun has gone down. Regardless of what time you go, or which group you happen to join, L&B will be throwing a surefire pizza and ice cream party.

I have no idea why it took us this long to make it to Underfinger (they’ve been open for eleven days), but we finally had dinner here over the weekend. All we can say is that you’ve never seen anything like this before, and yet it feels so familiar. Here’s the story.
The chef at Underfinger, Jesper Paulsen, grew up in Copenhagen just a few miles from Noma, and has eaten there several times. He’s taken that training and applied it to the Scandinavian tradition of serving minimalist finger sandwiches at funerals. The end result is one of the city’s most impressive tasting menus, a somber celebration of “farm-to-finger” ingredients and classic Neo-Nordic techniques.
If you’re having trouble picturing what that might look like, you aren’t alone. Underfinger has a strict no-photography policy, which might explain the lack of Instagrams, or “first looks” or “10 Reasons Why This Place Will Make You Want to Nom” coverage since they initially applied for a liquor license back in 2012. Paulsen believes very strongly in the idea of secrecy, likely a result of his years spent in the Danish army.
The best we can do is try and paint a picture for you, and hope you’ll take our word for it. Underfinger is pretty much what you’d get if you combined the best parts of Momofuku Ko with the best parts of Askerhus, the Norwegian restaurant at Epcot Center. It is both challenging and accessible, fun and at the same time frightening for children.

This restaurant is still one of our all time favorites in this town. A few things stand out as qualifications for such an honor: outstanding and consistent food, great service, an excellent wine list, and some ancillary entertainment since we can’t sit still. Let’s address each individually.
L’Artusi is the sister restaurant to Dell’anima, and it’s the larger, louder sister for sure. The cuisine is Italian, and it’s the kind of Italian cooking that’s not afraid to go heavy on big flavors like garlic, lemon, olives, chiles, and fat to win your favor. Not that it’s unrefined - these are some of the most well thought out and beautiful plates we’ve had the pleasure of eating at an indecent pace.
The service is fantastic, from the hosts to the bartenders to the guy getting crazy at the cheese counter. And the wine list here is unparalleled. There’s a huge, expertly curated selection of Italian bottles from every part of the country, categorized by region and accompanied by information on what to expect from each. You can find everything from an excellent Rosso Di Montalcino for $45, to a $650 Gaja Barbaresco that will make you wish you had $650 to spend on wine every night (don’t do that). Stick to the affordable stuff and ask for help. The sommelier will happily lead you to great wine at good value.As for entertainment, that comes in the form of excellent people watching. There is always a good mix in the room of dates in various stages of progression, generally hot people, and a celebrity here and there to pretend you don’t notice. Not to mention one night when some dude spent three minutes violently pounding on the bathroom door that he couldn’t push his way out of, despite the massive “pull please” directly in front of his face. Maybe go easy on the Barolo, dude.
The most important thing about L’Artusi, though, is how you do it. Here are a few things to know: it’s critical that you sit at the bar if you are a party of two. The tables in this place get cramped unless you’re at a big one, and it’s also the easiest way to get a seat - reservations can be hard to come by.

For a slice to justifiably cost that much money, it should probably either be topped with some kind of delicious and rare animal meat (panda?), or be the last f*cking slice of pizza in the world. The $5 slice of pizza at Di Fara is neither of those things. But it is the best pizza in New York.
It’s the ingredients and the care that set Di Fara apart from the rest, from the sweet and tangy sauce, to the imported cheese and olive oil, to the fresh basil that pizza maker Domenico DeMarco cuts himself. The wait time in this place regularly stretches into the two-hour territory because DeMarco inspects every pie, refusing to rush through the process just because you think you’ve got somewhere to be. You came here for pizza from the best, and you’re going to get pizza from the best, even if it takes all afternoon.
If it’s the money you’re worried about, you can always just order yourself a whole pie ($28) and save a little bit of cost per slice. Or you could just pay the $5 and shut up about it.
Either way, Di Fara knows it has this town by the balls. Midwood is not exactly what you’d call a gentrifying neighborhood, and the rents surely aren’t crazy this deep into Brooklyn. So what gives with the prices? The American dream, that’s what gives. DeMarco is well aware that he earned those lines that wrap around the block on a daily basis, and he seems intent on cashing in on it. And we couldn’t be happier to pay the asking price, no matter how high it rises. A flight to Naples costs a lot more - and there is no guarantee you’d even like the pizza over there any better.
A few things to know before you set off on your Di Fara adventure: They’re closed Monday and Tuesday, they’re closed between 4:30 and 6:30pm every day, it’s cash only, you WILL wait at least an hour for your pie, and you WILL want to order another after you are done making love with the first.

The restaurant got a facelift in 2006 to keep up with the changing times (see, computers), and as a result feels a bit more modern than you might expect for a place that's 27 years old. But make no mistake that this is a relic from another era.
When it comes to the food, Periyali is responsible for much of what one might call ""Modern Greek Cuisine"" in New York City. OK, nobody actually calls it that, but they did make this particular kind cooking viable in upscale restaurants. People weren't serving grilled octopus and moussaka on white tablecloths before this place existed.
Fast forward to 2014, and Periyali is still serving up some pretty damn good Greek dishes - especially that previously mentioned octopus. There are, however, a lot of sleepy items on the menu that won't leave much of an impression, and the wine list could most definitely use an overhaul. But if you stick to some of the classics and pretty much anything lamb, you'll be in good shape.

It's also important to decide whether or not you're looking for a sleek, ""Scarpetta in Williamsburg"" feel to your evening, because that's what goes on here. Basically, Antica Pesa is a trip, and it's one you need to be prepared for.
We had not considered any of those things before our visit to Antica Pesa, and were a bit caught off guard by what came at us. First of all, this is a beautiful restaurant that probably cost well into the millions to design and decorate. Not something you'd typically find on a random stretch of Berry Street. Second, the staff here is very intense. Antica Pesa has a sister restaurant in Rome, so this place is full-on Italian in both attitude and passion for what they do. We love that, but prepare yourself for lots of firm handshakes, and a guy in a $3,000 suit and neck scarf who insists on doling out the pasta portions among your table himself. All in all, it's both crazy and endearing, and a far cry from some of the other restaurants around here that hand you some food and a paper napkin and then wait for you to leave.
As for the food at Antica Pesa, we generally enjoyed it, but also found it to be the least memorable part of the experience. It's entirely possible that we've just become accustomed to the New York City version of Italian cuisine, and this authentic Roman stuff is too subtle and nuanced for our overactive taste buds. It's also entirely possible that Antica Pesa is just a bit hit and miss. There were a few items that we really liked on this menu, and then there were some simple things, like Cacio e Pepe, that seemed poorly executed.
At the end of the day, we probably won't rush back to Antica Pesa for a full blown meal, but we'd happily come grab a drink and a seat by the fireplace at the bar.

beers in a place without windows. (We have very specific cravings).
Cull & Pistol is a casual raw bar and seafood restaurant from the owners of
the adjacent market, The Lobster Place. The Lobster Place is a prolific
wholesaler of seafood to area restaurants, and their Chelsea Market storefront
is one of the best places to buy fish in town. So there's no question as to
the quality of Cull & Pistol's product. The food they make with that product
is pretty good too, as long as you know what to order. The question is, why
should you eat here, as opposed to the hundred other places in New York that
serve oysters and a lobster roll? The short answer is location. This isn't the
best lobster roll in town, but it's probably the best one in the neighborhood.
They also have a $1 oyster happy hour that you should be taking advantage of
if you work in or near this building. As a matter of fact, you should probably
put a ""very important meeting"" in your calendar for 4-6pm one day this week,

The difference between dining at a hot restaurant in Manhattan and a hot restaurant in Sunnyside is like night and day. Salt & Fat is easily the coolest restaurant in a five mile radius, and even though there's a no reservation policy, you can walk in and get a table with zero issue during prime time. They greet you with free bacon popcorn, drink prices aren't insulting, and you can eat like kings and queens for under $50 a head. They're also the only restaurant we've ever been to that serves Thousand Island dressing with everything. Salt & Fat doesn't go out of their way to impress with a slick design like the others either. Instead, what you have is a restaurant that was probably once a used DVD store, and all they did to the space was add a kitchen and a bunch of pig paraphernalia. The orange lighting and stained drop ceilings remain, and make Salt & Fat feel more like a Chinatown dive than a any place a ""gourmand"" would dine. God, we hate that word.
The truth is, we wanted to love Salt & Fat more than we actually did. Every dish on the menu reads like a carnivore's delight, and while some items are incredible, like the BLT buns and the crispy pork trotter, others, like the pork belly and the fried chicken, completely miss the mark.

We’ve been spending more time in this part of town lately, thanks to the Gotham West Market and a recent Infatuation initiative to uncover more great restaurants in every neighborhood, not just ones that end in the word “village.” And uncover we did. We found this little place The Marshal, and you need to know about it.
The Marshal is a very small restaurant on 10th Avenue, on a picturesque block that’s also home to a huge gas station and a condo building that looks like something a child with poor depth perception built out of Legos. Hell’s Kitchen encapsulated. A friend of ours turned us on to it after he randomly met the owner in a wine shop. We decided to check it out, and it’s definitely the kind of place that would be owned by a guy you’d randomly meet in a wine shop. Everyone at The Marshal is exceptionally friendly. The food also happens to be excellent.
As a matter of fact, The Marshal reminds us a lot of a Hell’s Kitchen version of Upstate Beer & Oyster Bar. Both are great neighborhood restaurants with dedicated regulars, and they both share an appreciation for New York. Nearly everything that The Marshal serves comes from somewhere in our great state and is then cooked in a wood-burning oven. The food is simple and homey - as in the best thing on the menu is meatloaf. It’s exactly the kind of place that we’d visit weekly if we lived nearby, especially if we lived in one of those weird looking condos. Do those things even have kitchens? Or do they just come with an infinity sink and a toaster?

Today we bring you an updated review of Seki, not because the restaurant has changed since our initial assessment, but because we’ve really got this place dialed in now. In our early days of eating here, we would sit down and wander through some very good but fairly standard sushi orders, and then cap the meal off with one of their legendary spicy scallop hand rolls. That’s certainly not a bad way to operate, but it’s not the best way to operate. We’ve had countless meals at Seki since then and have wised up significantly to the game. So here we are to pass that wisdom on to you.
A meal at Sushi Seki is all about knowing two things: the few special pieces to order, and where to knock off an armored truck before dinner. If you do it up right, your meal will set you back $100 per person. It will also be one of the most satisfying sushi experiences ever. Especially if you can experience it on someone else’s dime.

It had been a long time since we’d actually eaten in this restaurant, thanks mostly to the fact that reservations are nearly impossible to secure. We
finally managed to make our way in a few times in the last month or so and decided a review refresher was in order. Five years in restaurant terms is essentially a geologic period. And yes, that’s a dinosaur reference.
After our recent visits, two things seem apparent: Locanda Verde is at least as good, if not slightly better than it was back in 2009, and it’s also still
a serious scene. The food is consistent and generally excellent, and this is still one of the best celebrity sightings destinations in all of New York. The only downside is that along with that scene comes a pretty uncomfortable environment at times. Between the bar and the dining room, a lot of people get crammed into this space. And if you are a party of two, chances are good that you will end up dining at a very small table, in very close proximity to someone who will likely be wearing crocodile somewhere on their person.

Apparently, New York City and Bangkok both share a similar problem when it comes to Thai cuisine, in that the majority of it is either toned down or sweetened up for consumer palates. Somtum Der is trying to bring the strong and spicy Isan flavors of Northeastern Thailand to both cities, complete with lots of fermented fish sauce, and Bird's Eye chilies, but probably minus the grilled field rats. Though if they had any balls, they'd have a New York City version of that dish on the menu too. Your move, letter grade department.
Som Tum is actually the word for green papaya salad, and a good portion of this menu is focused on examples of what a real authentic version of that dish tastes like. There are eight different papaya salads on the menu at Somtum Der, and almost all are a bit different than the ones that you'll find at your average Thai restaurant in New York. For example, the most authentic version, Tum Poo-Plara, has crab and lots of the aforementioned fermented fish sauce in it. It most definitely does not lack flavor, but that funky fish sauce is a taste that not everyone will find appealing.
I suppose that's the story with this place. We have really enjoyed our meals at Somtum Der, and the best things we've had are the dishes that remain truest to Isan cuisine. But you'll find a lot of other stuff on this menu that's there to appeal to a wider audience, and that stuff is way less interesting.

Today I've decided to give it a shot with this restaurant review of Glasserie, so that you can effectively decide whether or not to spend your money there.
Pros:
- Awesome atmosphere. Maybe the best restaurant vibes in Brooklyn.
- Interesting food, influenced heavily by the chef's Israeli heritage.
- Lots of excellent vegetarian options on the menu.
- Great outdoor/patio situation.
- Square bar, ideal for scoping other patrons across the bar.
- One of the best things on the menu is bread.  
Cons:
- One of the best things on the menu is bread.
- Staff is too cool to have emotions.
- Portions are on the small side, especially if you are sharing.
- Lots of hype. Might be responsible for the term ""New Greenpoint.""
- Other patrons might be scoping you from the bar.
- Isolated location, unless you live in an abandoned warehouse nearby.  
The way we see it, those pros outweigh the cons, though there are certainly some significant cons Ultimately, we like Glasserie. But we might like it for the ambiance more than anything else. If you do decide to go, bring a bunch of friends, and try a few things to share.

Sort of.
If you've ever been to the Toro in Boston, you probably know it to be a very busy, but pretty excellent little tapas joint with an open kitchen and about 65 seats. It's cozy and crowded, and that's all part of the appeal. Drinking sherry and eating pinchos in a small warm room in the winter is a pretty great way to spend dinner, especially when you can feel that everyone else in the room is having a good time too.
But the version of Toro that we got in New York is quite a bit different than its Boston counterpart. First of all, it's massive. There are supposedly 125 seats, which according to my state university education makes it just shy of double the size of the original location. But the 30 foot ceilings and huge bar area make the room feel much bigger than that. This Toro feel less like a restaurant and more like a dinner warehouse where food parties happen. Food parties with expensive ham. And when you consider the location they chose to open in, it sort of makes sense. The restaurant is on the 11th Avenue side of the same building that houses Colicchio & Sons and Del Posto, situated just north of the Meatpacking District. They're going squarely after the same people that frequent places like Catch and The Dutch, which is to say people that often care more about the scene than the food when they're deciding where to eat. So far, those people seem to like this place A LOT.
We like Toro too, for both the food and the atmosphere. Yes, we prefer the more intimate surroundings of the Beantown location, and yes, there are other Spanish restaurants in New York that we like more. But this New York Toro achieves the same feel good vibes of the original, and that's what makes it appealing. You can tell that everyone in this place is having fun, eating egg-on-a-spoon things and drinking out of porrons (see, ancient Spanish beer bong for wine). The menu is massive, and there are definitely some hits and misses, so knowing what to order (and having a reservation) is they key to having a good meal here.

But the Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop is the one that's really got people fired up. This is the first-ever permanent NYC restaurant from international ramen icon Ivan Orkin, and if you find yourself wondering who that is and why he doesn't sound like a Japanese person, allow us to fill you in on that too.
Ivan Orkin is a white Jewish man who grew up in Long Island, majored in Japanese at the University of Colorado, graduated from the Culinary Institute of America, and ultimately opened up a ramen shop...in Tokyo. And not only did his ramen succeed in Japan, it has become one of the most critically acclaimed and popular shops in the country. As you can probably imagine, that's quite the feat for a foreigner, and Ivan's legend has been steadily growing since he got in the game in 2007. Aside from a few pop ups here and there, ramen fans in New York were relegated to reading about his stuff in places like Ramen Magazine, and yes that's apparently a thing that really exists. But now Ivan is finally here with a permanent Ivan Ramen location.
Like most of the other vendors in the Gotham West Market, Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop is cafeteria-style eating. You walk up to a counter, order your food, find a seat, and wait for your name to be called. Then what gets delivered to you is a bowl (or two) of seriously excellent ramen that we've decided we could eat every single day. The well-balanced chicken-based broth and the excellent rye noodles add up to an incredible soup that isn't nearly as heavy or nap-inducing as something like what you find at Ippudo. We also like this set-up, which is a piece of cake compared to the long waits at some of the other popular ramen spots around town. Here's to hoping that the 11th Avenue location make for manageable crowds. Ivan is also opening a flagship restaurant on the lower east side soon, so consider the Slurp Shop an appetizer to the forthcoming main attraction. Fire up your chopsticks.

God knows the UES has, thanks to recent additions of The East Pole, The Meatball Shop and The Penrose, all breathing hip, new life into an otherwise tired #EEEEEATS scene. It's too bad then the UWS gets stuck with Cafe Tallulah leading the charge, a massive bi-level French/Mediterranean upstairs bistro and downstairs lounge. Clearly, ""flavor"" is all in the eye of the beholder, and unfortunately, the Cafe Tallulah crew thinks lounge chic is what the UWS needed. Sucks for us.
Remember, in the early 00's, when lounges were all the rage in NYC? There were tons of them, mostly in Chelsea, and all your friends who went to Wisconsin had their birthday parties there. Well, if you're looking to relive the old back room of Pop Burger glory days, take a trip to Cafe Tallulah. Metallic walls, plush red curtains, big artsy photos of models and of course, Ultra Chilled Volume 1 as the soundtrack. Moby into St. Germain into Theivey Corporation, bonafide elevator music we were all guilty of being into thirteen years ago. They even brought in someone from Employees Only to run the cocktail program. Bartender, a Cosmopolitan please.
Despite this restaurant already being on its third chef in ten months of existence, we found the typical bistro fare to be generally better than we expected. It's all hit or miss, and the appetizers are where it's at. One can achieve a solid and reasonably priced meal by pairing a tartare, a salad and the scallop app, which was the best thing we ate. Don't get pasta. The descriptions sound delicious, but the results shouldn't be served as restaurant food. The service was annoying. This is one of those places where, even for a table of five, the servers don't write down the orders. What's the point? They forgot to bring our beers, forgot to bring a salad, and forgot to bring an entree.
While Tallulah feels misguided for 2013, it's still a welcome addition to a hood that's desperate for any kind of of Action at the Bar.

Allow me to elaborate.
Back in September, I had a 5:30pm reservation for four on a Saturday night. One member of our group was coming in that day from outside of the country, and her flight ended up getting severely delayed. This presented us with an interesting dilemma - cancel the reservation and pay a $175 per person fee, or keep the reservation and hope for the best, meaning that she'd be late but not by much. We decided on the latter (because this is dinner, not live television) and headed to the restaurant. Once we got there, we explained the situation to the staff, who seemed annoyed but aware that they should at least try to be somewhat accommodating. 5:45 and 6:00 passed, and the hosts began to express some displeasure. Finally our tardy guest arrived at 6:15, and we were seated for dinner.
From that moment until the end of our meal, we had a pleasant and impressive experience, just as you would expect from one of the most acclaimed restaurants in the world. The food was excellent, and everything seemed to have turned out OK, despite the fact that we were very late for our reservation. Dessert, petit fours, and coffee were served, along with the check which was settled in a reasonably hasty manner. That's when things got interesting.
Not all that long after our check was paid - let's call it fifteen minutes - a staff member arrived at our table. This man in a suit chatted us up for a while with some small talk, and then explained that he would like to show us the kitchen. We obliged, because we are New Yorkers, and real kitchens are majestic places that we usually only see on vacation or Pinterest. About three minutes into our boring and seemingly pointless walkthrough, it occurred to me what was happening. We were being tastefully ejected. Sure enough, when our tour concluded, we were not brought back to the dining room, but through another door that led directly to the foyer and a hostess holding our jackets.
Now, before you decide who the real asshole in this equation is (me or him), consider this. I would argue that even though we were late, there would have been a much easier and far less dickish way to handle this situation -honesty. Had this guy simply walked up to us and said, ""I'm sorry folks, but we really need this table,"" we would have jumped up immediately and finished our conversation in the lounge, or even somewhere outside if they so wished. We're all adults here, as evidenced by the fact that we just spent a Vespa on dinner. But that option was never afforded to us. Instead, we got played.
Clearly this situation is unique, and hopefully not something you'd encounter if you decided to visit Per Se. But it's also not our first bad experience here. There seems to be this thing at Per Se where the staff acts like it's your privilege to be in their restaurant. Instead of a warm welcome, it feels more like you've been granted access to the king's palace, and they're worried that you're going to act like a commoner. Even when we came here previously to eat in the salon, our waiter treated us like we were sitting at the kid's table during family dinner, and I wasn't even the one who ended up spilling the wine. This guy dribbled on our placemat when he poured both of our glasses, and then he just walked away. That doesn't happen at Daniel, no matter where you're sitting. Then again, the staff at Daniel will also give you a tour of the kitchen that doesn't end in sadness. All you have to do is ask.",4.0,French,Per Se,8.5,"I got kicked out of Per Se.

For the first time in a long time, a restaurant that you’d typically expect to pop up in Brooklyn has instead decided to settle on the Lower East Side. Contra, complete with its young risk-taking chefs, daily tasting menu, and earthen tableware, is now open on Orchard Street instead of on Bedford Street. It’s either the
beginning of a trend, or the end of one. We’re not exactly sure which yet.
Either way, Contra is important. It matters because it’s the perfect example of why this city is so f*cking great. What is possibly our best new restaurant of the year just managed to open with pretty much no advance press or hype, because everyone was busy paying attention to a bunch of other new places that probably won’t be relevant (let alone open) five years from now. Even our most enthusiastic of food enthusiasts seem to be still figuring out that Contra exists. But everyone is going to catch up very soon. You won’t find a $55 five-course menu that competes with this place anywhere in town, and that
includes Battersby. Contra is better than both of those places by a long shot.
And so just like we did, it’s only a matter of time before the old food world giants notice this place and crash in on it like a giant Godzilla with
Instagram. The New York Times can’t be far off, Dana Cowin will soon be posting photos from her table three nights a month, and you won’t be able to get a reservation without an internship at one of those places. We just hope that Contra can manage to stay humble throughout the process. There’s already a little bit of dude-attude going on with the service here, and that’s likely to get worse as popularity increases. How they handle the pressure will probably dictate whether a city full of critical diners with lots of options will keep coming back. This isn’t Brooklyn, you know.

Contra, complete with its young risk-taking chefs, daily tasting menu, and earthen tableware, is now open on Orchard Street instead of on Bedford Street. It’s either the
beginning of a trend, or the end of one. We’re not exactly sure which yet.
Either way, Contra is important. It matters because it’s the perfect example of why this city is so f*cking great. What is possibly our best new restaurant of the year just managed to open with pretty much no advance press or hype, because everyone was busy paying attention to a bunch of other new places that probably won’t be relevant (let alone open) five years from now. Even our most enthusiastic of food enthusiasts seem to be still figuring out that Contra exists. But everyone is going to catch up very soon. You won’t find a $55 five-course menu that competes with this place anywhere in town, and that
includes Battersby. Contra is better than both of those places by a long shot.
And so just like we did, it’s only a matter of time before the old food world giants notice this place and crash in on it like a giant Godzilla with
Instagram. The New York Times can’t be far off, Dana Cowin will soon be posting photos from her table three nights a month, and you won’t be able to get a reservation without an internship at one of those places. We just hope that Contra can manage to stay humble throughout the process. There’s already a little bit of dude-attude going on with the service here, and that’s likely to get worse as popularity increases. How they handle the pressure will probably dictate whether a city full of critical diners with lots of options will keep coming back. This isn’t Brooklyn, you know.

I would plug in one of those electric kettles, heat up some water, toss in a block of dehydrated noodles and a pack of seasoning that was probably 90% bath salts and 10% artificial beef dust, and that would be dinner.

It's been a while since I've felt nostalgic for that stuff, but I found myself reminiscing after our recent visit to Ramen Yebisu. Why? Because I realized that I would rather be eating factory packaged sort-of-food than paying $12 for the ramen this place served us.
Ramen Yebisu sits on the corner of N. 6th and Berry in Williamsburg, right in the middle of a highly-concentrated area of Williamsburg shops, restaurants, and cheap looking condos, and just down the street from Music Hall of Williamsburg. It's the perfect place for a trendy new ramen restaurant, partly because of the foot traffic, and also because there's nothing like that anywhere this neighborhood. Unfortunately, Ramen Yebisu has failed miserably so far in filling the void.

Our problem with Ramen Yebisu lies mostly with the broth, which always seems to fall flat. And that's not in comparison to the ramen on steroids that people are used to from places like Ippudo. We've had authentic Japanese ramen with mellow flavors, and we like it. But this stuff doesn't seem to have any flavor at all. On top of that, this restaurant seems to be out of order.

It’s as if the neighborhood is stirring, slowly waking up from a deep sleep that it’s been in since, well, the ’60s. Here’s a little bit of history for you. Did you know that this part of town used to be home to the hottest singles scene in New York City circa 1965? And that the epicenter of that scene was the original T.G.I. Friday’s, on 63rd and 1st? Seriously. The pill had just been invented, and for some reason, people were flocking from all over the city to Friday’s for a cocktail and some casual sex, and maybe an appetizer sampler. Imagine that. There was a point in time where you could pick up something other than heart disease at T.G.I. Friday’s.
Clearly, times have changed, as this neighborhood is mostly inhabited by a bunch of rich people that probably remember those days. Rich people and me. I’ve actually been an East 60s resident for nearly seven years, and while I love it for many reasons, the dining and nightlife options are not among them. Other than a few key standbys, this area for the last several decades has basically consisted of places that are either marginally better or marginally worse than China Fun. That’s our median. Or at least it was.
Things appear to be improving around here when it comes to restaurants, and the most important improvement just came via a partnership between The Fat Radish and the Martignetti brothers, whom you probably know best for Brinkley’s. The two entities have teamed up to essentially bring The Fat Radish uptown, with some of the sceney sensibilities that the Martignettis are known for. We’ve been to The East Pole a few times now and can tell you that they hit the nail on the head. This place is exactly the youthful shot in the arm that this area needed. The vibe is decidedly downtown, the food is as good as it is at The Fat Radish, they stay open until 3am, and the staff are all very nice, or at least they are for now. These Upper East Side ladies can be brutal. On our last visit, we saw a few of them drinking white wine outside and chain smoking cigarettes, just looking for someone to talk down to. 
As a matter of fact, part of the challenge for the East Pole will be whether or not they can maintain some of the downtown appeal to this place, rather than surrendering it completely to the Real Housewives of You Aren’t On TV.

I am going to assume that you've been in New York for a significant amount of time. Actually, let me be more precise and venture a guess. You moved here about four years ago, right after college. You've got a pretty good job, some Ikea furniture, and a handful of friends that you predominantly communicate with an Emoji. You go out to dinner three nights a week, and you probably do brunch once or twice a month. Forty percent of these meals take place in the East Village. Kale is present in nearly all of them. You are, at least in Immaculate Infatuation terms, an average New Yorker. And you're missing the whole point.
Back in the olden days, the restaurant scene in New York was much different. We don't need to fully explore the history of dining for the purposes of this discussion, but let's just say that there was a time when the most intriguing pastry-hybrid in the city was a black and white cookie, and if you wanted one, you went to your neighborhood diner. As a matter of fact, when you wanted pretty much anything that wasn't cooked by a French guy or served with chopsticks, you went to your neighborhood diner. And when you showed up, they probably addressed you by name. They probably also knew exactly what you were going to order. When was the last time that one of the hostesses at Vinegar Hill House addressed you by name? Never, unless it's to tell you that the wait will be another two hours.
When I say that you're missing the point, I mean that we've all apparently forgotten about the great New York City diner, and what it means to a community. We're more interested in the new hot spots - places that we visit once or twice right after they open and then never go back to.

This diner on Madison Avenue has been serving its neighborhood regulars since 1976, and it also happens to have one of the best turkey club sandwiches you can find anywhere. But that's not what makes it great. What makes Viand great is the fact that every time you eat there, you'll see someone walk in that the staff knows by name.

Or maybe it's one of the several women who frequent this place that look like a mix between Hilary Clinton and a very expensive hooker (this is the Upper East Side after all).

At first, it seemed like this place was going to be our very own Little Serow, a much celebrated Northern Thai restaurant in Washington D.C. that is our undisputed favorite dining destination in that city. We've been aching for a spot like that in this town - something a bit more traditional and authentic than say, Kin Shop, but with the same ability to wow us with new and creative ways to present the flavors. Unfortunately, Khe-Yo only got us half way there. Which, if we're talking about D.C., would geographically be Delaware. So yes, Khe-Yo is Delaware.
Generally, we liked this restaurant. It's a nice place with nice people (as is Delaware), and we really loved a lot of the food that we ate, mostly in the first half of our meal. Which brings us to our overall point. Khe-Yo feels like something of a half measure. The beginning of this menu is everything we love about the food from Southeast Asia. It's shareable, full of flavor, and often best eaten with your hands. The Crunchy Coconut Rice and Duck Laap salad particularly blew our minds, and the Pork Belly and Shrimp Crispy Rolls didn't suck either. And then we got to the entrees. Maybe it's because Laotians don't really eat $33 plates of Black Bass, or maybe it's just that they haven't quite figured out the formula in the kitchen, but for some reason the entrees in this restaurant really run into problems. Our Pork Jowl Red Curry was so salty that it was inedible, and even if it wasn't, the pork jowl bits were more like rubbery little fat nuggets than they were delicious pig face meat. The same goes for our sodium-crusted Lemongrass Spare Ribs that we could barely finish due to concerns for our blood pressure. The Bell & Evans Grilled Half Chicken wasn't bad, though it also wasn't particularly remarkable, and the Chili Prawns were about on par with any above average shrimp dish in Chinatown. Thank god for sticky rice.
We're certainly not experts on this kind of cuisine, but our ultimate assessment of Khe-Yo is that they should have gone all the way. It feels like the chef felt compelled to create a menu of entree dishes to appease the locals, rather than fully committing to the idea of many small dishes to be shared at the table and eaten with glorious handfuls of glutinous rice. But who knows? Maybe a half measure is exactly what this Tribeca neighborhood wants. Maybe they're happy with a mere taste of these ethnic flavors, so long as they come packaged in a familiar dinner-time format.

Now, there are probably at least a few of you out there that scoff at the suggestion that a restaurant anywhere near Midtown could be compared to a fixture of the downtown “scene” like Carbone, and to that we say, good luck out there being the coolest person ever, and also stop using the word “scene.” You sound like an asshole. We’ve actually heard from a few people that we trust (and who are pretty cool) that they prefer the old school Italian grub here to the stuff at Carbone, and that’s got our attention. So does this chicken parm pizza that everyone is talking about. More on that shortly.
After a few visits, we’re not ready to say that we like this restaurant as much as the one that they are most definitely taking some cues from. But we do like it a lot. We like the food, we like the service, we like the space, and we even like the “scene,” which is far from stuffy, but still formal enough to function as a post-work or pre-theater destination for those eating in this area for that purpose. We’re also particularly fond of the small street-level bar and shop beneath the massive restaurant, which has a garage door that opens out to the sidewalk and serves drinks, snacks, sandwiches, and something called gelato cake.
But our favorite thing about Quality Italian is how they have managed to take this concept of the new classic Italian restaurant, complete with table-side preparations and waiters in bow-ties, and made it work by melding it with what they’ve done successfully down the street for so many years - a steakhouse. This place actually feels less like a new concept than it does an update on Quality Meats, with more pasta, some meatballs, and little touches like “gorgonzola dolce” that make a filet mignon sound vaguely more Italian. All in all, it works really well.
And then there’s the aforementioned Chicken Parmigiana for two, which is really just a giant meat pizza and has become something of a calling card for the restaurant. Let us be the ones to tell you that you don’t need to spend the $60 it’s gonna cost you to try it. We found it to be bland and uninteresting, and honestly, this place is better than that.

We like the food, we like the service, we like the space, and we even like the “scene,” which is far from stuffy, but still formal enough to function as a post-work or pre-theater destination for those eating in this area for that purpose. We’re also particularly fond of the small street-level bar and shop beneath the massive restaurant, which has a garage door that opens out to the sidewalk and serves drinks, snacks, sandwiches, and something called gelato cake.
But our favorite thing about Quality Italian is how they have managed to take this concept of the new classic Italian restaurant, complete with table-side preparations and waiters in bow-ties, and made it work by melding it with what they’ve done successfully down the street for so many years - a steakhouse. This place actually feels less like a new concept than it does an update on Quality Meats, with more pasta, some meatballs, and little touches like “gorgonzola dolce” that make a filet mignon sound vaguely more Italian. All in all, it works really well.
And then there’s the aforementioned Chicken Parmigiana for two, which is really just a giant meat pizza and has become something of a calling card for the restaurant. Let us be the ones to tell you that you don’t need to spend the $60 it’s gonna cost you to try it. We found it to be bland and uninteresting, and honestly, this place is better than that. Save your money for the pastas, any sea-born appetizer, and those vaguely Italian steaks instead.","57 W. 57th St., New York, NY 10019",Manhattan,10019,team brought quality meat welcome quality italian like call midtown carbone probably least scoff suggestion restaurant anywhere near midtown could compared fixture downtown scene like carbone say good luck coolest person ever also stop using word scene sound like asshole actually heard people trust pretty cool prefer old school italian grub stuff carbone got attention chicken parm pizza everyone talking shortly visit ready say like restaurant much one definitely taking cue like lot like food like service like space even like scene far stuffy still formal enough function post work pre theater destination eating area purpose also particularly fond small street level bar shop beneath massive restaurant garage door open sidewalk serf drink snack sandwich something called gelato cake favorite thing quality italian managed take concept new classic italian restaurant complete table side preparation waiter bow tie made work melding done successfully street many year steakhouse place actually feel le like new concept update quality meat pasta meatball little touch like gorgonzola dolce make filet mignon sound vaguely italian work really well aforementioned chicken parmigiana two really giant meat pizza become something calling card restaurant let u one tell need spend 6 gonna cost try found bland uninteresting honestly place better save money pasta sea born appetizer vaguely italian steak instead,"(40.7644047, -73.9768632)",40.7644047,-73.9768632

Which brings me to Bohemian. This “secret” restaurant behind the Japan Premium Beef butcher on Bond Street doesn’t have a published phone number. You’re supposed to obtain it from a friend who has already dined in the restaurant, just as they do at the original location in Japan.

So after hearing chatter about this place since it opened up back in 2009, we finally played the game, tracked down the number, and made it in for dinner. And as you might imagine, we felt the need to talk about it. Bohemian is amazing.
What impressed us the most about Bohemian is that it’s not impressive because it’s exclusive. Usually, these “hidden” or “private” restaurants are a huge let down, like when you actually get inside the Soho House and see that it’s nothing but a bunch of trust fund dudes and the least famous Jonas Brother hanging out together. Much to our surprise, the food is absolutely excellent here, and the environment delivers, too. And the key to it all is simplicity. The room is small and vibey and very relaxed, with couches and lounge chairs and low profile tables. It’s about as perfect as a Date Night restaurant can get, because it’s comfortable. As for the food, you might think a secretive place like this would serve some crazy sh*t like blowfish sashimi or live scorpion tacos. But instead, the best things to eat are a whole branzino with brussels sprouts and olives and Wagyu beef steaks from the butcher out front.

Like when you were a kid on Halloween and you’d come home and eat your candy so fast that you’d throw up everywhere. Or the first day of college spring break, when you’d finally get to Panama City and then you’d throw up everywhere. You know...from the excitement.
Or when you go to a new restaurant and have a few great meals, and then proceed to drop a 9.0 rating on the place like it’s the gastro-pub version of Eleven Madison Park. Such was the case with our initial review of Allswell. Let’s just say that we got a little worked up.
Only ten other restaurants on Immaculate Infatuation have an equivalent or higher rating than our initial review of Allswell. And while this place is very good, subsequent visits have demonstrated that we might have gotten a bit carried away. The restaurant hasn’t necessarily declined in overall quality -Allswell is still putting out very good food - but the problem is that they change the menu daily, and things therefore become somewhat inconsistent. And when you’re talking about what sets a great restaurant apart from a legendary restaurant, consistency usually has a lot to do with it.
Ultimately, Allswell still remains one of our favorite dining establishments in Williamsburg, and we strongly recommend that you check it out for dinner if you haven’t yet.

Like when you were a kid on Halloween and you’d come home and eat your candy so fast that you’d throw up everywhere. Or the first day of college spring break, when you’d finally get to Panama City and then you’d throw up everywhere. You know...from the excitement.
Or when you go to a new restaurant and have a few great meals, and then proceed to drop a 9.0 rating on the place like it’s the gastro-pub version of Eleven Madison Park. Such was the case with our initial review of Allswell. Let’s just say that we got a little worked up.
Only ten other restaurants on Immaculate Infatuation have an equivalent or higher rating than our initial review of Allswell. And while this place is very good, subsequent visits have demonstrated that we might have gotten a bit carried away. The restaurant hasn’t necessarily declined in overall quality -Allswell is still putting out very good food - but the problem is that they change the menu daily, and things therefore become somewhat inconsistent. And when you’re talking about what sets a great restaurant apart from a legendary restaurant, consistency usually has a lot to do with it.
Ultimately, Allswell still remains one of our favorite dining establishments in Williamsburg, and we strongly recommend that you check it out for dinner if you haven’t yet.

Now, we have the utmost respect for Fat Mike, and NOFX, and punk rock or whatever, but let's be honest - with the current demographic that would even remotely care about his involvement (dudes in their thirties who peaked at seventeen), that kind of billing only matters if you're selling $15 tickets to a Hudson River concert cruise.

But after wandering around for about twenty minutes at 10:30pm on a Tuesday and realizing that we'd never be able to wash the shame of San Loco off our souls, we wandered in to get our Greek on instead. And we've gotta say, these little souvlaki wraps are six bucks well spent.
Apparently souvlaki is a common street food item in Greece. It's basically a charcoal grilled meat, wrapped in a pita, with french fries stuffed inside. Yes, it's random. And yes, it's delicious. We took down a few different varieties, and went in on some of the other menu items after that. At the end of the day, we came away glad that we gave Souvlaki GR a chance. Is it going to change your life? Not even close. But it might save it in a pinch, when your only choice is this or the burrito place across the street that people throw up in from time to time.

I felt like I was having dinner at Sushi Samba in 2007.
Playlist critiques aside, Jin Ramen is a great little restaurant. Tucked under the 125th Street subway stop, this place turns out some really good ramen and (obviously) pork buns. I'd say it's a hidden gem, except it's well known amongst the Columbia community and Harlem locals, and is always busy. Each time we've visited, the dining room has been packed with a mix of students and neighborhood types, slurping up noodles and bumping to the sounds of Now Vol. 26.
Before you get ready to make a trip up to parts of New York City you've only seen from the inside of a Metro North car to eat some ramen, let us tell you how we think Jin stacks up to the other spots around town. This is definitely not Ippudo, and Totto Ramen beats it by a mile. But those are the best in town. If you like Hide Chan and Rai Rai Ken, you're going to love this place. It's not quite as authentic as either of those, but you'll definitely be satisfied and full of pork fat and sodium by the time you leave. Our biggest critique here is that we didn't love the noodles - they seemed a little tough and too much like the ones you get out of a package. But the broth, especially the spicy pork, is incredible.
Ultimately, Jin Ramen is absolutely worth a trip if you're looking to get some variety into your ramen rotation, and if you go to school at Columbia and haven't already hit this place, you need to do so immediately. I don't know what college is like these days, but ""eating ramen"" meant something entirely different at Colorado State University...and it usually involved filling up an electric kettle in the water fountain at 2am. You kids have it pretty good.

One of our own omakase-obsessed friends was raving about it a few weeks ago, and then it seemed like suddenly everyone we know was trying to get a reservation. And getting a reservation is no easy task. Tanoshi is only ten seats around a counter, and they do three seatings a night. It used to be that you had to come to the restaurant at 1pm to put your name on the list. Fortunately, they now accept online reservations.

This was a difficult review to write because we really wanted to love this place. Little Prince is a restaurant in Soho with so much promise, but every time we’ve wanted it to deliver, it’s let us down a little bit. Kind of like your really smart cousin who just can’t kick the weed and sleeps in his car every once in a while. You know he has greatness in him, but he just keeps disappointing you. And it always comes down to discipline. Our meals at Little Prince have been good examples of both those analogies.
On our first visit, we showed up for dinner on a Thursday night and had a really nice time eating some classic French bistro food, though we admittedly ordered very simple things and chalked up some of the small inconsistencies to a busy evening and early stage kinks. But then we returned a few weeks later on a quiet weekday night, and some of the true problems with this place shined through. Big problems. First of all, if there is one thing you can’t afford to screw up when you operate a French restaurant, it’s technique. You cannot serve a classic Lyonnaise-style frisée salad with so much vinaigrette that it could also sort of be a soup. Your simple roast chicken can’t be over-salted to the point that it almost tastes like jerky. And, most importantly, you can’t hire a bunch of waiters because they look cool, even though you could very easily convince them that “poulet” is the French word for swimming pool. That sh*t doesn’t work. Especially not in New York, and especially not with Balthazaar a few blocks away making you look bad. Don’t get us wrong - everyone at Little Prince is very, very nice. But you’d have to think they could find a few people that know not to fill a glass of wine to the very top like it’s the last one on earth. We like to drink and all, but we’d prefer not to need a straw.
I suppose what we’re getting at is that Little Prince would benefit greatly from a little bit (a lot) of fine tuning. This place has to figure out how to be a consistently good restaurant - from the kitchen to the wait staff -before it becomes a Soho go-to.

Kind of like your really smart cousin who just can’t kick the weed and sleeps in his car every once in a while. You know he has greatness in him, but he just keeps disappointing you. And it always comes down to discipline. Our meals at Little Prince have been good examples of both those analogies.
On our first visit, we showed up for dinner on a Thursday night and had a really nice time eating some classic French bistro food, though we admittedly ordered very simple things and chalked up some of the small inconsistencies to a busy evening and early stage kinks. But then we returned a few weeks later on a quiet weekday night, and some of the true problems with this place shined through. Big problems. First of all, if there is one thing you can’t afford to screw up when you operate a French restaurant, it’s technique. You cannot serve a classic Lyonnaise-style frisée salad with so much vinaigrette that it could also sort of be a soup. Your simple roast chicken can’t be over-salted to the point that it almost tastes like jerky. And, most importantly, you can’t hire a bunch of waiters because they look cool, even though you could very easily convince them that “poulet” is the French word for swimming pool. That sh*t doesn’t work. Especially not in New York, and especially not with Balthazaar a few blocks away making you look bad. Don’t get us wrong - everyone at Little Prince is very, very nice. But you’d have to think they could find a few people that know not to fill a glass of wine to the very top like it’s the last one on earth. We like to drink and all, but we’d prefer not to need a straw.
I suppose what we’re getting at is that Little Prince would benefit greatly from a little bit (a lot) of fine tuning. This place has to figure out how to be a consistently good restaurant - from the kitchen to the wait staff -before it becomes a Soho go-to. There are too many other places nearby that offer the same experience, only better. See you at Raoul’s.","199 Prince St., New York, NY 10012",Manhattan,10012,understand possible someone invest god know much money opening restaurant new york probably least million dollar plus endless amount time energy emotional strife end staffing place bunch people f cking baffled concept serving food human difficult review write really wanted love place little prince restaurant soho much promise every time wanted deliver let u little bit kind like really smart cousin kick weed sleep car every know greatness keep disappointing always come discipline meal little prince good example analogy first visit showed dinner thursday night really nice time eating classic french bistro food though admittedly ordered simple thing chalked small inconsistency busy evening early stage kink returned week later quiet weekday night true problem place shined big problem first one thing afford screw operate french restaurant technique cannot serve classic lyonnaise style fri e salad much vinaigrette could also sort soup simple roast chicken salted point almost taste like jerky importantly hire bunch waiter look cool even though could easily convince poulet french word swimming pool sh work especially new york especially balthazaar block away making look bad get u wrong everyone little prince nice think could find people know fill glass wine top like last one earth like drink prefer need straw suppose getting little prince would benefit greatly little bit lot fine tuning place figure consistently good restaurant kitchen wait staff becomes soho go many place nearby offer experience better see raoul,"(40.72685355, -74.0026931124206)",40.72685355,-74.0026931124206

576,1.0,0.1273999959230423,"mexican, pizza, tacos, slice, artichoke, pie, taco, kesté, pies, mole","We're all familiar with the current New York restaurant trends - bakery by day/restaurant by night establishments, nose to tail cooking, never-ending tastings that cost as much as a small car. Feast is a new restaurant in the East Village that checks off a lot of those boxes. It is indeed a bakery during the day, and they most definitely embrace the ""whole animal"" mentality at night. But, as suggested by the name, this is not an expensive tasting menu situation. Feast is a meal meant to be shared amongst friends. You sit down and they load up your table, Thanksgiving style.
Feast's concept is fun. We definitely give them credit for mixing it up and taking a different approach to restaurant dining, and making it affordable in the process. The menu here consists of two different meals: a ""farmer's market"" vegetarian feast ($38 pp) and a ""nose to tail"" meat feast ($48 pp). There's also the option to order from a separate a la carte menu, just in case feasting isn't in your nature. In theory, it all sounds wonderful. But we took issue with the set up once we realized we had to abide by all kinds of rules. We don't do well with rules. Especially at the dinner table.
Here's the deal - feasts at Feast are made for two people, so you and your dining companion need to agree on either meat or vegetarian. You can't each order your own. If there's more than two and less than four of you, you're kind of f*cked. We had three people in our party and were frustrated by the fact that you can't order two meat feasts and one veggie feast. I begged and pleaded with our server, trying to reach a compromise by asking for single servings of select dishes on the veggie feast instead of the whole thing. But they weren't having it. She was visibly annoyed by our attempts too, which just made the situation worse. The most frustrating part is that each dish comes as a small duo. Would it really be that hard to stuff a singular eggplant with risotto and broccoli rabe instead of two? We think not. At any rate, we pushed on, and (menu gripes aside) we wound up enjoying our meal here. We were impressed with the imagination on display in dishes like the Oxtail Steak n' Eggs and the Lamb Shank Lasagna. It was also nice to have a huge table of food to eat from at your leisure, along with a reasonably priced and well curated beer and wine list to drink from. No single thing that we ate absolutely blew our mind, but this is definitely a restaurant we'd come back to, especially when we need a place for a Big Groups meal...as long as we've got an even number of people.
Nose To Tail Lamb Feast

Carpaccio
Razor thin slices of raw lamb are wrapped around honey crisp apple strips, drizzled with almond shavings and served with a delicious and spicy cognac mustard. The portion size is tiny, but the flavor is large.Merguez Stew
This was our favorite dish of the appetizer feast - a quail egg sitting in the middle of a tomato and lamb stew. It tasted like breakfast, which seemed to be a bit of a theme here. I guess that's what happens when you double as a pastry shop during the day. We're not complaining.Shepherd's Pie
Conceptually, this was really cool. It's a personal pastry of sweet potato pie, with a delicious square of lamb belly on top. But while it looked and sounded great, but it wound up being two separate components that just didn't work well together. The lamb belly was delicious, but it just kind of sat there on top of the dry, unforgiving pie.Roasted Pepper Salad
Sliced roasted peppers in a rich French onion sauce (soubise). This is sort of a sloppy mess, but it has all kinds of flavor. We liked it.Lasagna
The most impressive dish of the night. This lasagna is a wide, thin layer of pasta, wrapped around lamb shank, wrapped around goat cheese, and topped with broccoli rabe. This is different. This is interesting. And this is delicious.Rack of lamb
Let's call this good, not great. Our lamb was a little dry, and there was so much herby crust that it actually detracted from the flavor of the meat. At least it photographed nicely.Potato Gratin
Potatoes and cheese. Obviously good.Fricasse Of Winter Vegetables
Also known as a brussels sprouts salad with pearl onions and butternut squash. This ended up being one of our favorite dishes at Feast. ""Butter To Flour""
Dessert was insanely delicious here. It was essentially a sweet pizza with pear and maple walnuts on top, and a side of bourbon and lightly sweetened cream to add to the goodness.
A La Carte Menu

Steak N' Eggs
Hello insane breakfast for dinner. This was crazy in the best way possible. Shredded oxtail, on top of soft toast with a fried egg and béarnaise sauce. Incredible.Smoked Salmon
Yikes. This was terrible. The salmon was served as a filet and was nearly raw and kind of cold. And the apple fennel slaw was soaked in a not-so-tasty cider. No thanks.Chicken N' Dumplings
Big chunks of chicken are paired with a ""liver gnocchi"" and crispy pieces of chicken skin for added crunch. It's a nice use of many different chicken parts, but we probably wouldn't order this again.",2.0,American,Feast,7.3,"We're all familiar with the current New York restaurant trends - bakery by day/restaurant by night establishments, nose to tail cooking, never-ending tastings that cost as much as a small car. Feast is a new restaurant in the East Village that checks off a lot of those boxes. It is indeed a bakery during the day, and they most definitely embrace the ""whole animal"" mentality at night. But, as suggested by the name, this is not an expensive tasting menu situation. Feast is a meal meant to be shared amongst friends. You sit down and they load up your table, Thanksgiving style.
Feast's concept is fun. We definitely give them credit for mixing it up and taking a different approach to restaurant dining, and making it affordable in the process. The menu here consists of two different meals: a ""farmer's market"" vegetarian feast ($38 pp) and a ""nose to tail"" meat feast ($48 pp). There's also the option to order from a separate a la carte menu, just in case feasting isn't in your nature. In theory, it all sounds wonderful. But we took issue with the set up once we realized we had to abide by all kinds of rules. We don't do well with rules. Especially at the dinner table.
Here's the deal - feasts at Feast are made for two people, so you and your dining companion need to agree on either meat or vegetarian. You can't each order your own. If there's more than two and less than four of you, you're kind of f*cked. We had three people in our party and were frustrated by the fact that you can't order two meat feasts and one veggie feast. I begged and pleaded with our server, trying to reach a compromise by asking for single servings of select dishes on the veggie feast instead of the whole thing. But they weren't having it. She was visibly annoyed by our attempts too, which just made the situation worse. The most frustrating part is that each dish comes as a small duo. Would it really be that hard to stuff a singular eggplant with risotto and broccoli rabe instead of two? We think not. At any rate, we pushed on, and (menu gripes aside) we wound up enjoying our meal here. We were impressed with the imagination on display in dishes like the Oxtail Steak n' Eggs and the Lamb Shank Lasagna. It was also nice to have a huge table of food to eat from at your leisure, along with a reasonably priced and well curated beer and wine list to drink from. No single thing that we ate absolutely blew our mind, but this is definitely a restaurant we'd come back to, especially when we need a place for a Big Groups meal...as long as we've got an even number of people.
Nose To Tail Lamb Feast

Carpaccio
Razor thin slices of raw lamb are wrapped around honey crisp apple strips, drizzled with almond shavings and served with a delicious and spicy cognac mustard. The portion size is tiny, but the flavor is large.Merguez Stew
This was our favorite dish of the appetizer feast - a quail egg sitting in the middle of a tomato and lamb stew. It tasted like breakfast, which seemed to be a bit of a theme here. I guess that's what happens when you double as a pastry shop during the day. We're not complaining.Shepherd's Pie

We say that because while it's pretty good, the food here isn't really the focus. The menu is actually quite short - there are many more pages of tequila options than there are things to eat. We found that to be a bit odd for a Top Chef-helmed restaurant.
Añejo is the brainchild of season who-knows-what contestant, Angelo Sosa. He was the guy that didn't win, but the guys hated and the girls loved. Or maybe the girls hated him and the guys loved him. Who can remember anymore. You get the point. You also might remember Angelo from the first establishment he opened after his stint on the show, Social Eatz, which has since closed...probably because of the Z. We liked that restaurant, and there are some things we like about Añejo too, even though its food offerings are a bit limited. As we said earlier, what is on the menu here is pretty good. But they also take the “small” in “small plates” really seriously. We almost had to start a new category called “Perfect For: Tiny Servings” for this review. So if you come here starving and looking to stuff your face with Mexican food until you can’t walk, know that you’ll have to order just about everything they offer, and are likely to end up with a bill as big as the one you get from Time Warner Cable every month by the time you're done. But if you’re just looking for a couple good tacos and a killer tequila selection, this is your spot. And the margarita that the Village Voice called the best in NYC last year? Yeah, it’s pretty damn good, and you’ll get more than three sips out of it. The rest of their tequila-based cocktails are worth trying too.
The only problem that we have with Añejo other than the price/food ratio is the space itself. It’s always full and the crowd is usually attractive, but the tables are so tightly packed that every seat in the place might as well be at a communal table. That's good for creating a lively atmosphere and a few opportunities for eavesdropping, but you don’t have nearly as much space as you’d expect to when you’re spending $14 on a plate of two tacos.

We can't win 'em all, and considering we have pretty much everything other cuisine on lock down, we probably shouldn't get too upset about it. Also, it gives us a reason to actually look forward to traveling to LA. Tacos aren't the only form of delicious low-brow Mexican cuisine though. One avenue NYC hasn't driven down yet is the torta. Enter Tortaria, a new-ish cafeteria which focuses on the glorious Mexican sandwich it's named after. We're surprised more people aren't talking about this joint, because it's a diaper dandy (sorry, I've been watching way too much of the NCAA tournament).
We went in not expecting much, but left pleasantly surprised by what's going on at this place.

We've been trying for a while now to find a place worth visiting twice, but for some reason that's been elusive. Maybe there just aren't enough big money spenders in this part of the city to for a really high quality sushi establishment to survive. The good stuff tends to be expensive, and therefore the best sushi tends to live in places where platinum and corporate cards live too. Like Midtown.
Unfortunately, we don't want to eat in Midtown, and we find ourselves in Williamsburg from time to time. And there's only so much fried chicken and Brooklyn Lager that a guy can consume in one neighborhood*. So our search for great sushi in Williamsburg continues, and it most recently lead us to Bozu.
Here's the kicker, Bozu isn't even really a sushi restaurant. It's ""Japanese Tapas,"" because of course it is. I think what that means is that they have all kinds of inventive small plates on the strange tiny plastic menu they hand you, a few of which we tried and cared for very little. What that also means is that you won't find straightforward sushi here either. What you will find are sushi ""bombs,"" which are basically rice and fish and other stuff pressed together into a neat dome shaped thing. The bombs we liked.
Overall, Bozu is a weird little restaurant that has very obviously been around since before Williamsburg's restaurant scene blew up. You know, back when SEA Thai was the only other game in town, and you had to have funky lounge beats and club lighting in the dining room to stay up with the game. Needless to say, we don't love the vibe at Bozu, and we didn't love the service either. The staff is entirely Japanese, and while they are all very nice, the kitchen seems disorganized and slow. The food in general didn't impress us much, aside from a few of the bombs which were actually pretty good.

Sit at the sushi counter. 2. Order the omakase. 3. Sit back and enjoy. If you want to complicate things and add a fourth rule, we’d recommend closing your eyes while you chew. You’ll look like an idiot, but you don’t want anything distracting you from this fish. Yasuda is known for having some of the best sushi in the city, so we came in expecting a lot, and it still blew us away. The rice is excellent - slightly warm with just the right amount of vinegar. And we think it goes without saying that the fish was perfect, but we’ll say it anyway - the fish was perfect.
When you sit down, you’ll be handed two things: a short menu that features a few kitchen dishes and drinks, and a sheet featuring the day’s sushi choices. The sheet will likely have fish on there that you’ve never heard of before, unless you majored in marine biology. No worries. Just say “I’ll have the omakase,” and the chef will serve you about 20 pieces of the best fish they have that day. Depending on what you get served, it will cost somewhere between $100-130 per person before drinks. And it’s worth every penny. If you’re not that adventurous or are saving up for a special occasion (although you should really save up for this special occasion), you can also order a la carte. But be warned that although the a la carte menu doesn’t look that pricey, the pieces of sushi are pretty small, and it will take quite a few to fill you up. After our 24-piece omakase meal, some of us could have kept going for another 10 pieces or so. My credit card company wishes I had. Now I just have to figure out who to call about this interest rate. I’m not even sure Discover has a phone number anymore.
While the fish was fantastic, the overall experience wasn’t perfect. The service was very rushed. We were seated at 9:30, and we were finished, paid, and standing outside by 10:35. That’s a quick window in which to eat 20+ pieces of sushi, and especially quick if you consider what that means you’re spending per hour. The chef served the pieces two at a time, which pressured us into eating the first one quickly so we could get to the second before the fish warmed up and the rice cooled down. Even worse, one of the sushi chefs had customers who finished before we did. He took off his chef’s coat, stripped down to his undershirt, and starting cleaning his station. While we were still eating! Nothing encourages an appetite like watching a skinny-fat Japanese guy’s gut jiggle while he scrubs something. On the other hand, the restaurant was filled some extremely good-looking people, so we’ll call that a push.

We jumped on their bandwagon very early, almost three years ago when they showed up on the scene as a brunch only pop-up in the East Village. They've found lots of success since then, continually evolving and expanding, and adding Filipino cuisine to the wide list of ethnic foods that are well represented in New York City's restaurant scene. And not only has the local food community embraced the Maharlika team, but they even have Padma's stamp of approval...and she's on TV sorta.
Jeepney is Maharlika's second East Village restaurant, and this one is a take on a Filipino gastropub. That means lots of unhealthy, delicious creations made with a laundry list of ingredients that you've probably never heard of before. Here's the good news: If you like the idea of eating various pig parts in some sort of spicy chili sauce, you're going to love this joint. If that's some version of a recurring nightmare you've had over the last few years, this probably isn't going to be your favorite restaurant. And you should maybe talk to someone about that. Jeepney has a fun vibe, with boobs on the wall and a soundtrack that jumps from funky salsa to 80's to old school hip hop and 90's rock. We were impressed when ""Black Hole Sun"" came on the stereo and the entire staff went for it, in unison, like it was 4AM at Sing Sing Karaoke. This is our kind of establishment, that's for sure.
With Maharlika, which remains their better restaurant, and now Jeepney, Filipino food is quickly becoming one of our favorite new discoveries. Some of the food at this new restaurant is familiar gastropub fare, but with a twist that makes it different and unique. We loved the burger, which is made with a mixture of beef and Filipino sausage and served with spicy banana ketchup and aioli. There's also a full fried fish with chili peppers and a tomato-onion salsa is like nothing we've ever had before. And then there are things that are entirely new to us, like bulalo - a beef short rib stew with bone marrow. A couple cons: Jeepney is not cheap.

Ever since the Ace Hotel opened a few years ago, we’ve been waiting for this area to become something more than a place for weirdos to sell cheap luggage on the street. And it just might finally be happening. Between the new businesses and the New York startup community deciding to settle around here, this neighborhood seems to be benefiting from some fresh investment. That’s exciting news for everyone - except the guys looking to sell you a suitcase/maybe stab you.
This one block of West 26th Street is a particularly good example of our food-focused optimism for Flatiron, as it’s home to not only Hill Country and our new favorite Korean spot Hanjan, but also Maysville, a restaurant from the folks behind Char No. 4 in Brooklyn. Much like Char No. 4, this new spot is all about brown liquor, and they serve an excellent menu of things that have been “smoked and charred” to go along with a massive selection of bourbon and whiskey. But this is definitely not a BBQ restaurant. This is an American restaurant with Southern influences. You’ll find far more smoked fish here than you will slow-cooked meat, and there are also lots of vegetable and seafood-focused dishes that are both interesting and delicious. We made two trips for dinner to Maysville, and on both visits were totally impressed with the quality and creativity of the food. Not that we had low expectations - but we think we’re just a little bored with restaurants that are somehow paying homage to the American South. Fortunately, Maysville is anything but boring.
There are, however, two small grievances that we feel need to be mentioned along with our very high rating of this place. First of all, at both of our dinners, our server seemed a little bit lost. Ok, not lost - clueless. To the point that when we asked about one of the bourbon drinks on the menu, she speculated that it might be rum. Yikes. Also, Maysville is a really loud restaurant. The main bar/dining area is big and sparse, and lots of people hang out here for drinks after work. The end result is a room that amplifies the conversations of many buzzed people into one load bourbon-fueled roar. It’s hard to hear yourself think, let alone hold a discussion. If you’re looking to have a proper meal, we recommend making a reservation for a table in the smaller, more intimate dining room in the back. You’ll be much happier.

It’s not native to this land, and try as we may, there are only a few smoked meats in this town that can hang with the good stuff south of the Mason Dixon line. Mighty Quinn’s is one of them.
Mighty Quinn’s got their start at Smorgasburg. A former drummer from Houston was smoking meat in Pennsylvania and driving it in to Brooklyn every weekend. Soon people started lining up for it. What started as a personal obsession for the pit master suddenly became the obsession of pretty much everyone in Brooklyn.

Mighty Quinn’s meats are so juicy and tender they sweat beautiful little fat droplets, and it’s so smoky and flavorful that no sauce is necessary.

As we’re all well aware, barbecue isn’t a game we play on home ice here in New York (hockey reference?). It’s not native to this land, and try as we may, there are only a few smoked meats in this town that can hang with the good stuff south of the Mason Dixon line. Mighty Quinn’s is one of them.
Mighty Quinn’s got their start at Smorgasburg. A former drummer from Houston was smoking meat in Pennsylvania and driving it in to Brooklyn every weekend. Soon people started lining up for it. What started as a personal obsession for the pit master suddenly became the obsession of pretty much everyone in Brooklyn.

So when people start telling us about a place in the neighborhood that's focused on pickles and biscuits, and looks like a huge rustic cocktail lounge, we're listening.
After a few visits we have come to the conclusion that Jacob's Pickles is indeed one of the better and cooler restaurants on the Upper West Side. People pile into this place, and we can understand why. But if it were downtown, you'd hear considerably less about it. The food here is a creative menu of comfort cooking, built mostly with things like fried chicken, gravy, fried pickles, and the aforementioned homemade biscuits that are the size and density of a commercial cinder block. It's basically the kind of food that gave Paula Deen the pancreas flu, but served in a New York City setting. The problem though is that much of it is a snooze. There are a few key items on the menu that'll make you happy and also very fat, but the rest of it is forgettable. Things like mac 'n cheese that should be easy and satisfying end up tasting bland and uninspired for some reason. As for the pickles, those are great, but when they fry them, the arrive at your table in a heavy, soft batter not unlike what you'd find on a corn dog. We prefer ours a little more crispy.
At the end of the day, Jacobs Pickles is great if you need a spot for drinks or an Upper West Side dinner meetup with someone you know will embrace the heavy bar food. There are some good beers available, and they also have a pretty solid brunch, assuming you're planning on taking a nap after it. But it's not a restaurant with traveling for.
Fried Pickles

Small speakers in each corner play a strange mix of loungey hotel beats and what I believe to either be the Arabic version of Michael Buble, or music from the movie Aladdin. The staff is worldly, and while they don’t all seem to hail from this specific region, everyone looks the part. Very few have two discernible eyebrows. Ultimately, if you’ve ever walked into an upscale Greek restaurant, you’ve seen this movie before.
What makes Almayass exciting though, is its unique brand of cuisine. Almayass not only focuses on traditional Lebanese food, but also Armenian food, because the two cultures are so tightly knit. There has been a large Armenian population in Lebanon for centuries, and the best things that both of these peoples eat are on display at this restaurant. For someone like me with ties to both cultures, this place is heaven. The problem though, is that I’m not sure that Almayass will be heaven for you if this food doesn’t connect you with some version of home. It’s a fairly formal and expensive restaurant, which means it’s not the place to take a big group of friends who are just looking for some hummus and a falafel. Almayass is more of a [perfect_for slug =“dinner-with-the-parents”]Dinner With The Parents[/perfect_for] version of Tanoreen or Balade.

This ""restaurant"" (it's really more of a bar with a small menu) is so random that here's how our first visit went down. We popped into Ducks on a Wednesday night for some wings, and ended up eating home made beef jerky, St. Louis Ribs, some trail mix (?), a bite or two of brisket, a giant bowl of mystery noodle soup, and exactly zero wings. Why? Because we had to throw in the towel before the wings arrived. By that point there was a vicious sectarian battle between rival spices raging inside our stomachs, and we were too confused by what we had just eaten to carry on.
A second visit dedicated to wing consumption was also unsuccessful. The hickory smoked jerk chicken has way too much rub on it, and the wings are huge like they came off of a condor. No thanks. For some reason, everything in this place is so over spiced, over smoked, and overthought that none of it works. The beef jerky has squid ink on it. Why?

These were big, dry ribs that tasted like they spent too much time in the smoker. Go eat ribs somewhere else.Brisket

This vaguely Asian noodle soup is apparently popular in New Orleans, and our waitress insisted that we order it. It looked a lot like ramen, but had more of a lime/lemongrass flavor to the broth. It was probably the best thing we ate at Ducks, but we wouldn't order it again.St. Louis Ribs
These were big, dry ribs that tasted like they spent too much time in the smoker. Go eat ribs somewhere else.Brisket
This is definitely our highlight from the menu at Ducks. Probably because it was well cooked and properly seasoned. It seems to be a limited menu item, so if you're there, ask about it.","351 E. 12th St., New York, NY 10003",Manhattan,10003,ended duck eatery back reading kind business internet amazing chicken wing visit ready report back chicken wing good b absolutely idea going place restaurant really bar small menu random first visit went popped duck wednesday night wing ended eating home made beef jerky st louis rib trail mix bite two brisket giant bowl mystery noodle soup exactly zero wing throw towel wing arrived point vicious sectarian battle rival spice raging inside stomach confused eaten carry second visit dedicated wing consumption also unsuccessful hickory smoked jerk chicken way much rub wing huge like came condor thanks reason everything place spiced smoked overthought none work beef jerky squid ink wing favor hit pok pok pork slope looking bbq get fette sau really know tell come duck eatery except maybe drink trail mix could go camping chicken wing mentioned wing big hard eat way heavy jerk seasoning little restraint would go long way would smaller chicken beef jerky another menu item really bar snack beef jerky cured squid ink something maybe make darker certainly make taste much different rest beef jerky eaten year yakamein vaguely asian noodle soup apparently popular new orleans waitress insisted order looked lot like ramen lime lemongrass flavor broth probably best thing ate duck order st louis rib big dry rib tasted like spent much time smoker go eat rib somewhere else brisket definitely highlight menu duck probably well cooked properly seasoned seems limited menu item ask,"(40.6661664827586, -73.985106137931)",40.6661664827586,-73.985106137931

And what exactly do we mean when we say they ""don't give a fck?"" Certainly not that the service is bad. Aquagrill and the others all take very good care of their guests. What we mean is that these places have been around for decades, and as countless restaurants and restaurant trends come and go, they remain standing - unaware and uninterested in the fact that every single new spot in the East Village either has a pork bun on the menu or some guy that looks like Charles Dickens with a swizzle stick making $14 cocktails. These are restaurants that have white table cloths and still give you a bread basket. And they're still packed every night even though bread baskets are NOT cool.
What's funny about the timing of this long overdue review of Aquagrill is that what they do best - raw oysters - are the hot new restaurant thing of the moment. Everyone either has oysters on the menu or has ""oyster bar"" in the name of the place, like some sort of insurance in case the rest of the food on the menu sucks (see, The Dutch).

On any given day you'll find fifteen varieties, and they're all fresh, cold, and perfectly shucked. That alone is a good reason to come here - if we were rating Aquagrill on raw bar alone it would be a 9.5.
Unfortunately, the rating comes down a bit when you get into the rest of the food here. As you might expect, the menu is almost entirely made up of various seafood offerings, and it ranges from pretty decent to very good. It all depends what you order.

Monkey Bar Chopped Salad
Each time we've come, the chopped salad has changed. Our favorite was this one
- greens, tomatoes, chickpeas and pickled onions.Shrimp Cocktail
A pretty standard shrimp cocktail. Our one complaint was that the shrimp were a little soggier than they were crispy. We like it best the opposite way.Steak Tartare
It looked amazing, but the result was less than stellar. The huge chunks of beef were just too big and the potent meat flavor was overwhelming. Pass.Maine Lobster Club
We love lobster sandwiches. They are one of our favorite things. This one was a big time bummer. There was way too much bread and not enough lobster. This sad lobster club was a waste of money and should be removed from the menu. Or, they should serve it with at least double the amount of lobster and remove a layer of unnecessary toasted bread.Monkey Bar Burger
It's a $22 burger, but it's worth every penny. The blend of chuck, short rib and dry aged steak give it a real meaty flavor. The burger is juicy beyond belief and comes topped with sweet and sour peppers, garlic aioli and pepper jack cheese. It's one big, delicious mess and one of our favorite real deal burgers in midtown. Plus, the fries are incredible as well. So yeah, you should probably order this.Potato Gnocchi with Field Mushrooms
Gnocchi? Not really. More like mashed potato dumplings. All good though, we still enjoyed it. There were probably two sticks of butter in it. Good luck with those two extra hours in the gym the following morning.Pappardelle with Lamb Ragu and Spicy Relish
A rich, satisfying plate of pasta. We thoroughly enjoyed the thin pasta ribbons drenched in sauce are can confidently suggest ordering this.Rohan Duck

many other Daniel Boulud restaurants first. Clearly this is a world-class
dining establishment, as evidenced by a bunch of Michelin stars and Barack

town (DBGB and Boulud
Sud) to wonder if
the Boulud way is one that two idiots like us can truly appreciate. We know
good food when we eat it, but classic French dining is not what this site was
built on.
Knowing that, it shouldn't surprise you when I say that while I was very
excited to finally be going Daniel for dinner, a part of me was a bit
skeptical. Restaurants like this either live up to your expectations or they
don't. There's no in-between. I was sure this would be a good meal - but would
it be exciting? Only time would tell. Time and lots of money.It turns out that our meal at Daniel was absolutely incredible. It lived up to
all expectations and even exceeded some. To start, the service was perfect.
Never once did we get the French guy stink eye - only friendly and attentive
stewardship from people who know what you want better than you do. The food is classic, with little deviation from standard French practice, but it's also
inventive and insanely satisfying. We ate a lot, and not one thing let us
down. What surprised us though, was how lively the restaurant was on a
Saturday evening. Considering that this place is situated in the
epicenter of old money New York City, we expected to see nothing but cranky
old ladies wearing fur and treating the bus boys like personal property.
Instead, we found lots of young couples and people from out of town who were crossing this place off their bucket list. It's a nice environment, especially
if you eat in the salon area that's a bit more informal and upbeat.
Ultimately, Daniel is one of the best dining experiences we've ever had, and
we're glad to be saying that. And while this definitely doesn't change the way
we feel about the other places of his that we're less fond of, it does add a
little bit of context, and help us understand why people are still giving this
guy money. If someone hit me up right after this meal to invest in a ""downtown gastropub modeled after CBGB's"" I probably would have done it.

We're usually not fabs of the lobster roll served warm, but LJ's CT roll is where it's at. If we're ordering one item and one item only, it would be this. We loved the simplicity of the toasted bun, warm lobster, and drawn butter.Lobster Club Roll
Lobster salad with bacon and avocado? Sign us up. Trust us, it's as good as it looks.Crab Roll
The crab roll was the one sandwich we had that we wouldn't order again. The lump crab didn't taste like much. Skip it.Clam Roll
This one, however, is awesome. It's exactly the same as the appetizer clam strips, but on a bun this time.Crispy Oyster Roll
You can't find a fried oyster roll as simple and delicious as this around NYC. Get it.Lobster Dinner
We don't crave a full on lobster experience much when we're in NYC. We need to be out by the beach or somewhere that doesn't smell like hot garbage to get into that mode. If we were to ever need our fix though, this is absolutely where we'd come. $36 gets you a steamed 1 3/4 pound lobster with red potatoes, corn on the cob, coleslaw, and pickles.

The chowder here is really good. It's thick and creamy with an ideal clam-to-potato ratio. Definitely order this, but try not to fill up on it. There's too much other goodness to be had.New England Lobster Roll
It's true that we'd rather eat Luke's claw meat lobster roll over this one if we had to choose. But The Joint's roll is no slouch. The lobster salad is light on the mayo, with lots of substance.Connecticut Lobster Roll
We're usually not fabs of the lobster roll served warm, but LJ's CT roll is where it's at. If we're ordering one item and one item only, it would be this. We loved the simplicity of the toasted bun, warm lobster, and drawn butter.Lobster Club Roll
Lobster salad with bacon and avocado? Sign us up. Trust us, it's as good as it looks.Crab Roll
The crab roll was the one sandwich we had that we wouldn't order again. The lump crab didn't taste like much. Skip it.Clam Roll
This one, however, is awesome. It's exactly the same as the appetizer clam strips, but on a bun this time.Crispy Oyster Roll
You can't find a fried oyster roll as simple and delicious as this around NYC. Get it.Lobster Dinner
We don't crave a full on lobster experience much when we're in NYC. We need to be out by the beach or somewhere that doesn't smell like hot garbage to get into that mode. If we were to ever need our fix though, this is absolutely where we'd come. $36 gets you a steamed 1 3/4 pound lobster with red potatoes, corn on the cob, coleslaw, and pickles. You don't have to cook it, and you don't have to clean it up.

Coppelia is CHEAP. We're not talking affordable by NYC standards, we're talking cheap in Des Moines, Iowa. The majority of the menu clocks in under $10 which makes it possible to eat like a king and get a beer for under $20.
Being that it is so cheap, it's hard to hate on the food all that much. You could be doing a lot worse. Coppelia's pedigree almost works against them because we hold Yerba Buena in such high regard.

Especially one that doubles as a shrine to the legendary Walt Clyde Frazier. Please keep that in mind as you read this review.
Our love for the Knicks is well documented, so you shouldn't be surprised that we'd geek out over a restaurant like this. Throw in the fact that Clyde and his friends - we've spotted Earl The Pearl, Tiki Barber, and Justin Tuck on different occasions - are all hanging out here, and it's easy for sports fans to get lost in a world of star struck excitement. But this isn't a Dave & Busters. This is an attempt at a legitimate restaurant, and we need break it down as such.
In truth, without a basketball court and Clyde's involvement, we wouldn't be talking about the Wine and Dine. The restaurant is massive - it takes up an entire city block. We were there for a Rangers playoff game and it was barely a quarter full, which makes us wonder how they stay in business. The layout is clunky too, and while we like the idea of life sized Clydes on the walls and his tie collection lining the ceiling, it all comes off feeling a little sterile and strange. Exhibits A & B: the custom Clyde-ism cocktails that come in ridiculous spring break style martini glasses, and the bottomless beer mugs that come floating in an ice bucket. Weird.
On the bright side, in terms of restaurants reserved exclusively for Sports on TV, which is exactly what Wine and Dine is, the food is pretty damn good. We love the sweet and spicy wings, and most everything else trumps whatever you'd find at the local sports bar near your apartment.

For those of you who know your Mexican food well enough to understand the nuances, here’s how Gran Electrica gets down. The menu is full of street food-type small dishes - tacos, gorditas, quesadillas, etc. - and you will also find some of the real native staples like posole and tlacoyos. Everything is super fresh and relatively light (no smothered enchiladas here), and there’s authenticity present in all of it. We love the fish tacos, the gordita, everything from the mariscos section of the menu, and the plate of pork ribs that’s served with a side of homemade tortillas. As mentioned previously, the drinks are incredible, too, and the restaurant has a big back garden that sits directly under the Brooklyn Bridge. The only downside? Waits can be north of an hour during prime time, and there aren’t a lot of other options in the area. You’re going to have to cram yourself into the bar and have a few (a lot) of drinks while you wait it out.

The menu is full of street food-type small dishes - tacos, gorditas, quesadillas, etc. - and you will also find some of the real native staples like posole and tlacoyos. Everything is super fresh and relatively light (no smothered enchiladas here), and there’s authenticity present in all of it. We love the fish tacos, the gordita, everything from the mariscos section of the menu, and the plate of pork ribs that’s served with a side of homemade tortillas. As mentioned previously, the drinks are incredible, too, and the restaurant has a big back garden that sits directly under the Brooklyn Bridge. The only downside? Waits can be north of an hour during prime time, and there aren’t a lot of other options in the area. You’re going to have to cram yourself into the bar and have a few (a lot) of drinks while you wait it out. At least take comfort in the fact that you aren’t standing outside single file like they are for Grimaldi’s next door. Those people look way too sober.","5 Front St., Brooklyn, NY 11201",Brooklyn,11201,done plenty complaining lack good mexican food new york honest sick talking saying good mexican city tantamount saying time square suck exactly breaking news today might day finally put end griping gran electrica restaurant folk behind colonie might first place think serving simple excellent mexican food without gimmick secret basement tequila dungeon vw bus parked inside guy guacamole cart yet see anyone staff wear lucha libre mask simply best thing mexican food served lively restaurant killer drink knew find upside exclamation point keyboard using lot right know mexican food well enough understand nuance gran electrica get menu full street food type small dish taco gorditas quesadilla etc also find real native staple like posole tlacoyos everything super fresh relatively light smothered enchilada authenticity present love fish taco gordita everything mariscos section menu plate pork rib served side homemade tortilla mentioned previously drink incredible restaurant big back garden sits directly brooklyn bridge downside wait north hour prime time lot option area going cram bar lot drink wait least take comfort fact standing outside single file like grimaldi next door people look way sober,"(40.7026462805151, -73.9930205974243)",40.7026462805151,-73.9930205974243

An exclusive dungeon dining room guarded by a guy with a clipboard and a ponytail might work just fine in Nolita, but that stuff ain't gonna play in Brooklyn. Instead, management took their successful formula of street tacos + sexy restaurant and applied it to a Williamsburg appropriate venue, the old Wythe diner (most recently home to a restaurant called Relish). The old school diner remains in tact, but a taco stand has been added, and playing the role of sexy downstairs dungeon is a dark, loungey back room. We like it. A lot.
As for residents, mustache enthusiasts and super fans of Williamsburg, reaction to this La Esquina has been mixed. Most of the complaints tend to come in the price department, and to some extent, we understand that. When you've got La Superior down the street slinging gangster tacos at $2.50 a piece, you're gonna catch flak for prices that are almost double that. But we tend to think there's room for more both approaches, and we're glad La Esquina opened it's doors in the 'Burg.

So it didn't surprise us to learn that a new, clubby restaurant opened in the old Mason Dixon space - although it did kind of surprise us that they didn't keep the mechanical bull.
This restaurant, Sons of Essex, is a damn near facsimile of Beauty & Essex, not necessarily in decor, but certainly in purpose. The idea here is exactly the same: Come looking good and looking to get wasted, and maybe have some food. Just like Beauty & Essex, there’s a fake out entrance before the entrance, this time a deli counter where you can even get a sandwich. And also just like Beauty & Essex, the food is just barely good enough to pass it off as a restaurant.
We will say that Sons of Essex has a more Infatuation Friendly vibe than some of the other popular night clubs with food, and that they cater a pretty sweet playlist of 90s hip hop to blast at your head while you eat. They also managed to get Padma (call me) in an otherwise terrible promotional video for the restaurant. The cocktails are all pretty damn good, especially the unique boozy tea concoctions that we were pounding. But this giant menu of upscale comfort food disappoints more than it impresses. We're not exactly sure why there needs to be a whole page of grilled cheese and mac and cheese daily specials, but there is.

Problem is, if this menu looks too good to be true, that's because it is. That's a lot of action.

After our snacks arrived first, all hell broke loose. Random dishes came firing out of the kitchen in no particular order, one or two at a time. Salads and appetizers arrived after the entrees and there was no cohesion to our meal. It was really bad news, and the most poorly executed dining experience we've been a part of in a long time.

Maybe our friends can’t afford to eat at Daniel Boulud’s restaurants. Or maybe they just don’t want to. Fine dining like this seems to only stimulate the old folks nowadays. It must evoke memories of better times, when eating at a world-class restaurant was expected to be a sterile, stuffy experience courtesy of a French chef. But world-class = stuffy no longer. This city is lousy with awesome restaurants that I wear dirty jeans to. And maybe that’s exactly why a place like Boulud Sud fails to impress us much. Let’s forget about the fact that the food was largely mediocre - I also don’t want a waiter that’s going to scoff at me for ordering wine by the glass. Guess what, asshole? I’m gonna drink six of these. And just because you bother me, I’m going to ask inconsequential questions about each one. “The family that owns the vineyard - what are they like? Are they nice? That’s great. Bring me something else.”
Ultimately, we are sure that Boulud Sud is some kind of Mediterranean culinary stroke of genius, just like the critics say that it is.

It’s quite simple, actually. Regardless of the level of sophistication or style of cuisine at any given establishment, it all comes down to whether or not a restaurant resonates with us. Upstate may be relatively unheard of and fit to seat less than twenty people at a time, but we think it deserves a high rating on this site. And assuming you aren’t here just to write us hate mail, we think you’re going to like it, too.
We can’t say enough good things about this place. The East Village needed a friendly neighborhood oyster bar in the worst way, and Upstate throws down like Amar’e with two hands. This one hits me right in the heart, too. I went to college upstate (Ithaca), and to find a bar that proudly serves Ithaca Caskzilla and Saranac on tap is a beautiful, beautiful thing. Everything served and sourced by Upstate is locally produced: cheese from Valley Shepard Creamery in New Jersey, meat and (incredible) pasta from Russo’s Mozzarella and Pasta on 11th street, Southhampton Beer, Wölffer wines - as long as it’s independent, small, and locally crafted, they can get on board with it.
There’s no big name restaurateur at Upstate (it’s actually the same guys who used to run Shaffer City), nor will you find gimmicks, a press release, or even a freezer for that matter. The simple menu is small and ever-changing, depending on what’s fresh and available. There are always oysters - usually over a dozen options from both the East and West coasts. Other staples include beer-steamed mussels, scallops, and a ridiculous fettuccine with clams. Every menu item costs less than twenty bucks, and literally every single thing we’ve tried has been delicious. For a true seafood lover, this is heaven.
When you go, you’ll no doubt meet Shane, who runs the joint. He’s the man. He’ll remember you after one visit. He recognized us right away after our first, brief stop-in. “Yeah, you guys were in here last week.

Our people must be smoking the good mongo because there’s no way sane people like this place. The dinner we had here recently was one of the more unimpressive meals we’ve had in recent memory. It was downright painful and took f-o-r-e-v-e-r. You remember the feeling of being in class when that was the last place in the world you wanted to be?

Thanks for nothing Brindle Room.
Not much makes much sense at Brindle Room. They try and jam as many seats as possible into this skinny, awkward space and they do it with uncomfortable elevated seating. There are tiny bar spaces up front and along the wall, which barely have enough table space to fit a drink, let alone a plate of food. Not surprisingly, there wasn’t a single human wedged into any of these spots. From the outside, it looks like an inviting space, but inside it’s the complete opposite. The decor is anti-cozy, and the dark brown color scheme looks cheap and boring. But the food is what really got me. As you’ll soon read, most of it was completely inedible. If it wasn’t for a very delicious burger, which I went back a second time to try, this could have been one of the lowest ratings ever. While it’s still getting tagged as Perfect For Wasting Your Time and Money, two full burger points put Brindle Room’s rating safely in the fours.
The bottom line is that this restaurant is amateur hour at its finest. From the service, to the execution and everything in-between.

Lobster is most enjoyable when you can smell the ocean from which it came.
Lobster rolls are an extremely subjective delicacy. Everyone is entitled to their own personal preference. One of our all time favorites comes from Lunch in Amagansett. It's a mayo heavy, finely chopped lobster salad that you either love or don't understand. In Manhattan, Mary's Fish Camp and Luke's Lobster, while very different, make the rolls our dreams are made of.

So you can imagine that expectations were sky high for White's new hotel restaurant, Ai Fiori.
Unlike the charming, cozy Morini, Ai Fiori is a sprawling space with more room than they know what to do with. The bathrooms are bigger than both of our apartments combined.

So, as it goes when you've got a hot concept, Socarrat has begun its sprawl with a wine bar adjacent to its Chelsea flagship and a new, comparatively spacious location in Nolita.
This Nolita location is exciting news for a few reasons, most notably that it's much larger and they take reservations. No more bumping elbows at Socarrat Chelsea's communal table and praying you don't get seated next to a lefty. Right? Wrong.

Speaking of dates, we don't recommend coming here with a party of two, just for the simple fact that you're pretty much guaranteed to sit with the strangers.

Additionally, our waiter had zero knowledge of the menu; with every simple question we proposed he scampered into the kitchen to consult the chef. Amateur hour.

One half was served ""a la plancha,"" which apparently means thick and rubbery like car tire. It was gross. All fat, thick fat, and no tenderness. The other half was a fried cutlet - you ever had a fried pork cutlet before? Me either. There's a reason why pork isn't best served fried, because it's dry and generally not good.

Who needs a photo of the restaurant when you’ve got Kim on the red carpet from opening night? By the way, what the f*ck is she wearing? Is she boarding a spaceship? I am going to hate this place.
It’s amazing how one photo can really sum a place up. Beauty & Essex opened in December, just down the street from the owner’s first establishment, Stanton Social. Some restaurants celebrate their opening by inviting friends and family, others hope that TMZ shows up. Looks like they did a pretty good job showing off all the famous people they know (paid).
Clearly, what I am getting at is that Beauty & Essex is a spectacle. One of almost unprecedented proportion. This place is ridiculous. Like a ground level Boom Boom Room with food and slightly poorer people. The idea is that you walk into what sort of looks like a pawn shop, and the door opens into a massive, luxurious mega restaurant. There are two levels, two huge dining rooms, and three bars. One of which is in the women’s bathroom, and pours free champagne for all the ladies. Seriously. We didn’t believe it either until we saw a bunch of girls stumble out with half empty glasses and crooked lipstick. Then we checked out the men’s room hoping to find some free beers or something, and it might as well have been two buckets and a stack of paper towels in there. I guess they know who to keep happy.
But you want to know the worst part about it all? The food is actually pretty good. It’s easy to tee up on a place like this when the food sucks (see Standard Grill), but we honestly can’t hate on the meals we had at Beauty & Essex. You’ll find a creative menu with a lot of options, none of which will be written up in Saveur anytime soon, but most good enough to impress even your drunkest friends. We actually had a steak that could qualify as excellent. See how mature we’re being? We’re not even going to complain about how ridiculously expensive everything is. Gotta pay for those fur lined walls somehow.
Grilled Flatbread
A decent pizza type thing with a super thin crust. What it’s topped with seems to rotate, but on our visit there was bacon, apples and some Maytag blue cheese. Not bad, but you can do better.Thai Lobster Bisque Dumplings
I suppose this is a play on soup dumplings, with Thai flavors. Not the most amazing dumpling we’ve ever had, but you probably won’t be mad at it - as long as you don’t care about the price tag.Braised Short Rib Tamales
We like short ribs. We like tamales. No brainer.Bone Marrow
Roasted bone marrow, toast, marmalade. This might have earned Beauty & Essex a whole rating point. Order it.Steaks
If you’re going for an entree at Beauty & Essex, go for a steak. Otherwise, don’t bother and stick to the small plates. Our waiter was pushing a steak on us hard, to the point where we just assumed he was hoping to jack the bill up. He was not. The filet we had was excellent. And it comes with four dipping sauces, which we’re always down with. Split one for the table.",4.0,American,Beauty & Essex,6.4,"Yeah, that’s right. Kim Kardashian. Who needs a photo of the restaurant when you’ve got Kim on the red carpet from opening night? By the way, what the f*ck is she wearing? Is she boarding a spaceship? I am going to hate this place.
It’s amazing how one photo can really sum a place up. Beauty & Essex opened in December, just down the street from the owner’s first establishment, Stanton Social. Some restaurants celebrate their opening by inviting friends and family, others hope that TMZ shows up. Looks like they did a pretty good job showing off all the famous people they know (paid).
Clearly, what I am getting at is that Beauty & Essex is a spectacle. One of almost unprecedented proportion. This place is ridiculous. Like a ground level Boom Boom Room with food and slightly poorer people. The idea is that you walk into what sort of looks like a pawn shop, and the door opens into a massive, luxurious mega restaurant. There are two levels, two huge dining rooms, and three bars. One of which is in the women’s bathroom, and pours free champagne for all the ladies. Seriously. We didn’t believe it either until we saw a bunch of girls stumble out with half empty glasses and crooked lipstick. Then we checked out the men’s room hoping to find some free beers or something, and it might as well have been two buckets and a stack of paper towels in there. I guess they know who to keep happy.
But you want to know the worst part about it all? The food is actually pretty good. It’s easy to tee up on a place like this when the food sucks (see Standard Grill), but we honestly can’t hate on the meals we had at Beauty & Essex. You’ll find a creative menu with a lot of options, none of which will be written up in Saveur anytime soon, but most good enough to impress even your drunkest friends. We actually had a steak that could qualify as excellent. See how mature we’re being? We’re not even going to complain about how ridiculously expensive everything is. Gotta pay for those fur lined walls somehow.
Grilled Flatbread
A decent pizza type thing with a super thin crust. What it’s topped with seems to rotate, but on our visit there was bacon, apples and some Maytag blue cheese. Not bad, but you can do better.Thai Lobster Bisque Dumplings
I suppose this is a play on soup dumplings, with Thai flavors. Not the most amazing dumpling we’ve ever had, but you probably won’t be mad at it - as long as you don’t care about the price tag.Braised Short Rib Tamales
We like short ribs. We like tamales. No brainer.Bone Marrow
Roasted bone marrow, toast, marmalade. This might have earned Beauty & Essex a whole rating point. Order it.Steaks

We didn't totally rip BLT Fish in our initial review, but it's definitely an extremely underwhelming and overpriced restaurant. We had remembered liking their less expensive, laid back Fish Shack more, but a recent trip has changed our minds. It's a shame too, because that menu is right up our alley - fried fish sandwiches, oysters and beers are a few of our favorite things. But I had a feeling there could be a problem after reaching out to my buddy who lives across the street to find out his favorite thing to get here. His response was, ""food poisoning."" Oh boy.
Now that's obviously more humor than anything else, but I have to say, that lobster roll made us sick to our stomach. I like to consider myself a connoisseur of such delicacies, and BLT Fish Shack's roll is one of the worst I've ever had. It came out looking like chunky lobster chowder on a bun, with aggressive and peculiar seasonings. All that and it's $26. This thing wins the distinguished award of bring the only lobster roll to ever survive a date with this guy. At the end of the meal, all that remained was half a lobster roll, left on the plate, passed over by an entire table of seafood lovers. That's a sad situation.
We're being a little harsh here, and the reality is that BLT Fish Shack on the whole isn't THAT bad, but it should be better. The majority of the raw bar and appetizers will get the job done, but we just can't stop thinking about that awful lobster roll. After another sour experience with their fish establishments, we've decided that the BLT crew might just want to stick with steak.
Oysters/Raw Bar
BLT Fish Shack has one of the biggest and most complete raw bars in all of Manhattan. In the mood for crab? Choose from Jonah, Alaskan King or Dungeness. Clams? You can have either Littleneck or Topneck. There are also periwinkles, whelks and pretty much anything else from the sea that tastes good on ice. We've certainly had some nice crab and lobster selections in the past, but overall the quality and presentation could be better. Our most recent sampling of oysters, a combination of Kumamoto, Wellfleet and Spinney Creek, tasted fine but looked a little strange, like they were matted down in the shells and weren't sucked very well.Tuna Vegetable Tartare
A nice sized helping of raw tuna with an assortment of vegetables, but this pales in comparison to the tuna tartare dishes we've become accustomed to at BLT Prime and BLT Steak.Steamed Mussels with Fries
These are the best thing on the Fish Shack menu, hands down. We're freaks about mussels around here and give these our seal of approval. These come served in a white wine sauce with onion and other goodness. It could use a little more garlic, but on this menu, we're not complaining.Crispy Fish Tacos
A nice helping of fish tacos in soft tortillas, but nothing worth coming for. We're not sure what exactly is crispy about these as they're a bit of a sloppy mess, and the fried fish is smothered in some kind of green spicy sauce that isn't good.Lobster Roll
Epic fail. Read above. It's so embarrassing that I even mis-tweeted its photo (meant to tweet the crispy fish tacos, but this slop was dying to show its face). At least they were playing a good tune.BLT Tuna Sandwich
The table next to ours was eating this and it looked like a slam dunk. Wrong. Hard boiled egg slices on a seared tuna sandwich? No thanks. We had a couple bites of this and that was enough.

My family has been coming to Dylan Prime for years, and although it's definitely not the best steakhouse in NYC, there's something about it that's always resonated with me. It's got a cooler, more laid back vibe than most steakhouses, and, compared to Midtown, a better location as well.

Looking for a more sophisticated spot to watch Sports on TV? The Dylan Prime pub room offers up comfortable seating, an expansive bar and a menu of steaks and burgers.
Our favorite part about Dylan Prime? They aren't elitist about their meat.

With the exception of a couple of new flat screens, Walker’s is pretty much exactly the same as your Pops left it back in the day when this tavern was the place to be on a Saturday night. Walker’s is a Tribeca landmark - a prime example of a Classic NYC Establishment, and a low key spot that attracts an older crowd who enjoy a good burger and some Sports on TV. Rich with history and solid beers on tap, Walker’s serves up above average pub fare and makes up for things being a bit overpriced with large serving sizes. If we’re in the mood for a burger in Tribeca, we go to Walker’s without hesitation.
Burger
This big, fat, juicy eight ounce sirloin burger isn’t the greatest burger in history, but it gets the job done right. It’s a classic tavern burger, a few steps above what you would find in a good diner, and a couple of steps below a joint that specializes in burgers. The fries are average.
Roasted Organic Chicken
This right here is a Walker’s go-to. A huge plate of chicken that’s got a specific salty, garlicky flavor to it. It’s probably been the same recipe for forty years. Served with a mountain of mashed potatoes and some greens, for fifteen bucks, you really can’t go wrong.
Steak Sandwich
In theory, this should be really freakin’ good - shell steak on nice thick bun with caramelized onions, fries, and greens. But it’s one of those steak sandwiches thats hard to bite into because it’s just one big slab of steak in between the bread. There are some people who like this style of steak sandwich, but not me. Definitely go burger or salad over this.
Tuna Nicoise Salad
I always feel that restaurants get a little too cute with Nicoise salads. Yes, it’s nice to have an egg and green beans in the salad, but we still need some roughage to get down on too. Walker’s doesn’t get too crazy on the crazy veggies and you wind up with a good balance and sizable chunk of grilled yellowfin tuna.

That's how we feel about Death & Co. Any place that makes room on their menu to quote Hunter S. Thompson - ""I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity, but they've always worked for me."" - is on our wavelength. It's no secret that we like to booze. When it comes to fancy cocktails, Death & Co is one of our favorites. The drink list is ridiculous...it's nearly impossible to settle on something because each beverage is intriguing and awesome. Some of our favorites are the Cure For Pain (rye whiskey, vermouth, bourbon, and more goodness) and the seriously tasty Rita Hayworth (pineapple and sage-infused siembra tequila, lime juice, and acacia honey syrup). Damn is she fine.
It wasn't until recently that we figured out D&C was more than just a place to grab a libation or two. You can actually have an excellent meal as well. Think of it as a tapas joint that resembles a wedding cocktail hour: American classics that go quite well with a drink shaken or stirred. The kitchen paces itself well, so dishes come out one at a time, and they give you a chance to enjoy your drink as well as the food. After a long day, a Robert Johnson Swizzle (single barrel bourbon, lime juice, 10yr port, vanilla syrup and more) with a side of truffle mac n cheese is exactly what the doctor ordered.

That's how we feel about Death & Co. Any place that makes room on their menu to quote Hunter S. Thompson - ""I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity, but they've always worked for me."" - is on our wavelength. It's no secret that we like to booze. When it comes to fancy cocktails, Death & Co is one of our favorites. The drink list is ridiculous...it's nearly impossible to settle on something because each beverage is intriguing and awesome. Some of our favorites are the Cure For Pain (rye whiskey, vermouth, bourbon, and more goodness) and the seriously tasty Rita Hayworth (pineapple and sage-infused siembra tequila, lime juice, and acacia honey syrup). Damn is she fine.
It wasn't until recently that we figured out D&C was more than just a place to grab a libation or two. You can actually have an excellent meal as well. Think of it as a tapas joint that resembles a wedding cocktail hour: American classics that go quite well with a drink shaken or stirred. The kitchen paces itself well, so dishes come out one at a time, and they give you a chance to enjoy your drink as well as the food. After a long day, a Robert Johnson Swizzle (single barrel bourbon, lime juice, 10yr port, vanilla syrup and more) with a side of truffle mac n cheese is exactly what the doctor ordered.
Seared Petite Filet Mignon
A pleasantly surprising ditty of a steak. The meat has a great seared crust on it, and for sixteen dollars, we aren't complaining. This is really good, and could easily fill up one not-so-starving person.Lobster Brioche Rolls
Three lobster sliders served on toasted brioche rolls. These bad boys were a great compliment to the Grass Kilt (coconut green tea-infused grouse scotch, lemon juice, pineapple juice, acacia honey syrup, cinnamon syrup) I was sipping when they rolled out of the kitchen. Now, this isn't the purist Luke's Lobster approach - this is more of a chicken salad type of lobster salad as the lobster bits are mixed in equal parts with crunchy jicama, apple, and fennel slaw. They're little mini lobster sandwiches, and they're good.Wild Mushroom Tart

Not the case. While some of their highly touted dishes - namely the sea urchin toast and duck paella - were certainly quite good, the rest of the food wasn't nearly as impressive. Some of it even had to be sent back, and we rarely ever play that game.
Aldea pimps out their chef, George Mendes, New Orleans style. In NOLA, chef photos and accolades greet you at the front door and decorate restaurant walls, watching you eat. By the time your meal is finished, you know damn well that John Besh or Donald Link is the man that made it all possible. Aldea revolves its world around Mendes in a similar way. Our waiter must have dropped George's name three or four times, and I guarantee he's required to do that. It all feels a little desperate...if your food is that good, New Yorkers will recognize. No need to shove it in our faces. Despite all the name dropping, Aldea is a very comfortable eating environment. We lucked out and got the best seat in the house, the back booth right in front of the kitchen, which you should absolutely request when you're making a reservation. Overall, we're not saying Aldea is a bad restaurant, it just doesn't live up to all the hype. We'll go back sometime, we're just not in any rush.
Sea Urchin Toast
Ok. This was good. Really good. But it's also incredibly rich. Sea urchin sits on top of a thin toasted cracker-thing with cauliflower cream and sea lettuce. Pretty great.Salt Cod Croquettas
Possibly the creamiest cod crox we've ever had. I personally enjoyed them, but the rest of the table was not feelin' the ultra-smooth texture of these.Wellfleet Oysters
Six Oysters, seventeen bucks. I mean, come on. That's a bit much, especially when they suck. The oysters were quite disappointing, as was the pickled ramp mignonette. Next.Slow-Poached Egg
This was excellent. A slow poached egg sitting in a light spring garlic broth with truffle, sweet peas and smoked bacon. Break the yolk and mix everything together for the ultimate bite.Tilefish
Holy crap, this was gross. So bad that we actually sent it back to catch a little fire (the fish wasn't cooked at all). It appeared that they plated and garnished the fish right out of the fridge, and this wasn't supposed to be a sushi dish. When it came back cooked, it didn't matter. This fish tasted like it'd been sitting around for weeks and the biggest travesty is that it came highly recommended from our waiter. Stay away from the tilefish.Arroz De Pato
The dish Aldea is famous for, and pretty much the reason that we came. New York Magazine awarded it ""Best Paella"" and the Village Voice named it the Best Duck Dish of 2009. It's definitely really good, but as with this entire restaurant, it just didn't blow us (or the rest our my table), away. A paella of duck confit, chorizo, olive, and duck cracklings, the texture is fantastic, but the flavors are just a tad too overbearing.Pork and Clams
Don't let the name fool you, this really is just a pork belly dish. I thought we'd get a healthy dose of both belly and clams, but that wasn't the case.

Finding a good scene with reasonably priced, excellent food isn't easy. I was recently having drinks with a big group at The Standard Grill, in need of a dinner destination (we sure as hell weren't eating there). Unfortunately, I didn't really have a game plan in place. It's a stressful spot to be in. An entire crew is relying on you to make the right decision and lead them to the promised land for dinner. After a couple of desperate tweets for help, I made the call, and we landed at Perry St. Was it the right call? For a Saturday night, maybe not (this is definitely more of a weekday spot), but it was the best move we could have made under the circumstances.
Perry St is in the ground floor of some super-modern, all glass building on the West Side Highway. It's a nice place, but it's completely sterile and a little stuffy. It's definitely an older, more proper crowd. Got straight-laced family in town from Greenwich? This is the perfect Dinner with the Parents destination. Neither the maître d' or the tables around us were too thrilled with our quasi-rowdy party, which by Perry St standards might as well have been a table rave. The food was a let down too. After eating a spectacular dinner at ABC Kitchen the week before, I was expecting a more dynamic meal from a Jean Georges restaurant. That being said, we would come back here and order the butter poached lobster anytime. That's one of the single best dishes we've eaten this year, and it saved this review from the toilet.

We most definitely did, and we finally made an Infatuation Field Trip out of the city to check it out. Here's what we can tell you that you don't already know: not much. Blue Hill at Stone Barns is outstanding. But while you might already know the facts, you don't have Infatuation perspective on the place, and that's really all that matters isn't it? Let's discuss.
New York City has developed quite the obsession with local and sustainable food over the last few years. Ramps show up for the first time of the season at The Union Square Greenmarket, and people buzz about it like someone just figured out time travel. Every year. Those kind of people and that kind of culture has to exist for a place like Blue Hill to be truly appreciated. If you still eat more Fruit By The Foot than actual fruit, this might not be the best way for you to spend a few hundred bucks and four hours of your life. But if you're the type of person that desperately wants to meet a pig in person and then eat it, rent a car.
As for the facts, you probably know that chef and owner Dan Barber is a badass. You probably also know that the majority of what you eat at Blue Hill comes from the farm that the restaurant is situated on. This makes for an incredible meal that you leave in the chef's hands, known as the Farmer's Feast. It's a marathon of a dinner (ours lasted well into the next morning and we sat at 9:00), but it will blow your mind. The quality of the ingredients and the creativity in which they are presented is unparalleled, and as good as advertised. What really impressed us though, was the attention to the experience as a whole, and the over-the-top efforts that the staff made to ensure that we learned something. Want to know what was in that incredible brioche thing you just had? Suddenly some dude comes out of nowhere and puts a bowl of grains and an ostrich egg on the table. Curious about that watercress? It just so happens that the poor kid that picked it this morning is putting in a shift at the restaurant just so he can serve it to you. That's dedication to the cause, and it's executed with class on all levels. We highly recommend that you make your own field trip to Stone Barns, and if you want to get the most out of your journey, we suggest going well ahead of your reservation time.

It's a marathon of a dinner (ours lasted well into the next morning and we sat at 9:00), but it will blow your mind. The quality of the ingredients and the creativity in which they are presented is unparalleled, and as good as advertised. What really impressed us though, was the attention to the experience as a whole, and the over-the-top efforts that the staff made to ensure that we learned something. Want to know what was in that incredible brioche thing you just had? Suddenly some dude comes out of nowhere and puts a bowl of grains and an ostrich egg on the table. Curious about that watercress? It just so happens that the poor kid that picked it this morning is putting in a shift at the restaurant just so he can serve it to you. That's dedication to the cause, and it's executed with class on all levels. We highly recommend that you make your own field trip to Stone Barns, and if you want to get the most out of your journey, we suggest going well ahead of your reservation time. Roam the grounds, have a drink on the terrace, maybe help that kid pick some watercress.

specializes in one thing. Our rating system is a complex algorythm (developed
during my tenure at MIT), that assigns numeric values to countless variables
like food quality, menu options, service, atmosphere, and the probability that
you will get laid after dinner. It's science.
What we have noticed though, is that a lack of variables consistently produces
the same result...most of the restaurants that specialize in one thing earn
high marks from us. The following evidence supports our hypothesis: Burger
Joint, Luke's
Lobster, Bark
Hot Dogs, Flex
Mussels, and
Caracas.
Another test of this theory brings us to The Meatball Shop, a restaurant on
the Lower East Side operating with the sole purpose of turning out
ridiculously good meatballs and presenting you a few options in which to
consume them. There are meatball sandwiches, meatball sliders, meatballs in
sauce, and meatballs on pasta. Other than a few sides and a nice wine
list...that's it. The result? We love it. A concept that could easily have

specializes in one thing. Our rating system is a complex algorythm (developed
during my tenure at MIT), that assigns numeric values to countless variables
like food quality, menu options, service, atmosphere, and the probability that
you will get laid after dinner. It's science.
What we have noticed though, is that a lack of variables consistently produces
the same result...most of the restaurants that specialize in one thing earn
high marks from us. The following evidence supports our hypothesis: Burger
Joint, Luke's
Lobster, Bark
Hot Dogs, Flex
Mussels, and
Caracas.
Another test of this theory brings us to The Meatball Shop, a restaurant on
the Lower East Side operating with the sole purpose of turning out
ridiculously good meatballs and presenting you a few options in which to
consume them. There are meatball sandwiches, meatball sliders, meatballs in
sauce, and meatballs on pasta. Other than a few sides and a nice wine
list...that's it. The result? We love it. A concept that could easily have

Actually, if that's the case I should probably make this a 10.0...sorry grandma. I'm half Lebanese and grew up eating food like this at family gatherings, so I think it's a pretty big compliment to Balade when I say this reminds me of what grandma has coming out of the kitchen on holidays. The only reason Balade doesn't get a ridiculously high rating is because I don't think most people have any idea what a lot of this food is.

Whatever the case, if you don't know much about Lebanese food, you should just know that if you like garlic, olive oil, lemon, and meat - you're probably going to like what you eat at Balade.
There are are a handful of Lebanese restaurants in New York City, and many of them are very good. Some of the newer ones though, like Naya and ilili, are slick, modern, and high end.

Mike's Bistro is a big deal in the world of kosher restaurants. Although its appearance might suggest differently, this is a popular special occasion spot, especially with the younger generation. It's plain and rather boring decor give Mike's the feel of a glorified basement.

Let’s be honest. White tablecloth fine dining establishments are not places that you will typically find the staff of The Infatuation. We like things a little bit looser, a little bit dirtier, and a little bit more laid back. That said, every once in a while a man needs to throw on a pair of wrinkle-free Dockers and dine like a gentleman. Every once in a while, a man also gets a gift card to a restaurant for his birthday.
Whatever the motivation, on a recent weekday night, we found ourselves heading for an Infatuation man date at Eleven Madison Park. It was clear from the start that this would not be a typical night out stuffing our faces with burgers and pork buns. The dinner menu at Eleven Madison Park consists of different prix fixe configurations, including an eleven course chef’s tasting menu. No, this would not be another night of casual eating. This night we were going to be tucking our napkins into our collars and doing things real fancy like.
Fancy though it may be, the restaurant is surprisingly lively, and the room wide open and airy - definitely not typical of a place serving this kind of food. Make no mistake, Eleven Madison Park is fine dining at its most serious. The staff is polite, yet rigid and focused like they’re on a mission from God. I think one of them folded my napkin with his mind. While the formality of the staff can be a little bit awkward at times, their knowledge and focus is appreciated when eating at this level. The food rundown will give you the details, but our meal at Eleven Madison Park was amazing.

You won’t be disappointed.",4.0,American,Eleven Madison Park,9.2,"Note: The menu at Eleven Madison Park has recently changed - we’ll be updating the review shortly.
Let’s be honest. White tablecloth fine dining establishments are not places that you will typically find the staff of The Infatuation. We like things a little bit looser, a little bit dirtier, and a little bit more laid back. That said, every once in a while a man needs to throw on a pair of wrinkle-free Dockers and dine like a gentleman. Every once in a while, a man also gets a gift card to a restaurant for his birthday.
Whatever the motivation, on a recent weekday night, we found ourselves heading for an Infatuation man date at Eleven Madison Park. It was clear from the start that this would not be a typical night out stuffing our faces with burgers and pork buns. The dinner menu at Eleven Madison Park consists of different prix fixe configurations, including an eleven course chef’s tasting menu. No, this would not be another night of casual eating. This night we were going to be tucking our napkins into our collars and doing things real fancy like.
Fancy though it may be, the restaurant is surprisingly lively, and the room wide open and airy - definitely not typical of a place serving this kind of food. Make no mistake, Eleven Madison Park is fine dining at its most serious. The staff is polite, yet rigid and focused like they’re on a mission from God. I think one of them folded my napkin with his mind. While the formality of the staff can be a little bit awkward at times, their knowledge and focus is appreciated when eating at this level.

It's Thursday night at 2:30am and there's a line forty deep for a slice of pizza? That's just stupid. At the painfully slow rate at which Artichoke moves, that's at least an hour wait. By the slice, pizza is supposed to be that cheap, quick fix - but Artichoke is neither. I totally hopped on board the 'Choke bandwagon when it opened, and was pushing it on people non-stop. After all, how could I resist hyping up a hot new slice right next to my apartment? Unfortunately, there was trouble in paradise, and I soured on this place pretty fast.
My beef with Artichoke is three-fold. First, I absolutely can't stand Artichoke's deliberately slow operation. At first, fine, bask in the glory of your 24/7 line. Everyone wants a piece. I get it. But to continuously operate like this is infuriating. Hell, even when it's empty, it still takes fifteen minutes to get a slice! Is it too much to ask to just have hot pies ready to roll? Adding insult to injury, when you finally make it to the front, you're hardly taken care of. The dudes behind the counter are more concerned with singing along to ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" than getting your order correct. Keep a keen eye on what's going on, follow your slice from the pie to the oven, and then into the box to ensure they get it right. Lastly, the prices keep going up. For the signature Artichoke slice $4 isn't out of line, but pricing the others at $3.50 is a lot to ask. $7-8 for two slices? That's not cheap.
So, strike one for line enabling, strike two for poor customer service, and strike three for the non-recession friendly rates. When you take these things into account, Artichoke's rating takes a huge hit before we've even had a chance to eat anything.

The front area is a little small and usually way too stuffed, so make sure you hit the big downstairs bar while you wait for your table. Hill Country is a great big group style destination.
A personal drawback on my end is the live music downstairs. Is it really necessary to have C-rate Country/Bluegrass/Americana artists playing while you eat?

I like a nice meaty beef rib. While their ribs are huge, there's usually a lot more bone than meat and you have to work hard to get it off. Other than the ribs, my favorite BBQ attraction is brisket, and while Hill Country has actually been written up as having some of the best brisket around, a lot of us at our table found it to be just too dry for our liking. It's got nothing on Blue Smoke's brisket. That said, the pork shoulder and pork ribs are both excellent and the whole chickens are very tasty. Also, the fact it's serve yourself place is great so you can get a little bit of everything.",2.0,BBQ,Hill Country,7.5,"Love getting dirty on some BBQ? You'll love Hill Country. It's downtown Manhattan's biggest and baddest Texas style meat market. Think Disneyland in terms of barbeque. The sprawling, two-level space is packed with hungry patrons every night of the week, and has quickly become the Mecca of all NYC BBQ. The front area is a little small and usually way too stuffed, so make sure you hit the big downstairs bar while you wait for your table. Hill Country is a great big group style destination.
