It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.\\nAtomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.\\nTo get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard.

If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.\\nThe Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table.On paper, the bar snacks at The Polynesian look similar to dishes you’d get at a Murray Hill rooftop while sharing a couch with the former social chairs of Pi Kappa Alpha’s Georgetown chapter, but the food here is definitely worth snacking on while you drink. The crab rangoon has a thin, flaky shell with filling that’s mostly crab, and the ahi tuna poke is served over seaweed salad that tastes so briny you’ll have flashbacks to swimming face-first into ocean kelp and temporarily freaking out because, you know, the ocean is scary. But the thing that this place does best is actually fries. The crunchy, crinkle-cut fries here are topped with various spices and served with hoisin ketchup, and they belong in any debate about the best fries in the city.\\nThe largest option on the 10-item food menu is a $19 plate of four baby back ribs, so this isn’t the place to have a full dinner. It is a fun rooftop bar to use for snacks and great cocktails when you’re in a part of the city that can make even proud Manhattanites daydream of a brownstone in Park Slope. Get a booth inside and listen to the soundtrack of Supertramp, Pharrell, and Prince with a few coworkers who want a post-work drink stronger than sauvignon blanc, or order something on fire at the outdoor bar when you want to turn things up many notches after date night in the Theater District. Just be sure to mind your hair around the flames.'"

      "['You aren’t going to find an Upland in Bushwick, and won’t find a Babbo either. In part, that’s due to demographics. Yes, many families live in the neighborhood (and have for a very long time), but there’s also just a sh*tload of twenty-somethings making synth-pop or performance art or whatever it is you do when you graduate from college and want to prove to your parents that you got poetry in you. And that’s why you’ll find places like Sally Roots here.\\nOn any given night, the median age at this restaurant will be about 24. It’s a neighborhood spot full of neighborhood people, and nothing costs over $20. The food itself is Caribbean/American, and it’s pretty straightforward. Order a bowl of braised oxtail, and that’s what you’ll get - a scoop of meat on a pile rice and peas.Which isn’t to say that you shouldn’t go here. Sure, the plating isn’t fancy, but Sally Roots has other things going for it: it’s well-designed, dimly lit, and they play loud music. This place is perfect for a casual dinner date or a night out with friends, and if you’re one of the seven billion people who enjoy backyards, they have a great one.So when shouldn’t you come here? Maybe when you’re looking for a life-changing meal.\\nMostly, this is just food you put in your mouth while you talk to other people. It isn’t fancy, but it makes you feel good, and if you have a bad weekday, the pulled pork will put its arm around you and tell you that things could be worse.\\nAlthough don’t expect comforting service. Most employees here give the impression that they just got back from a Father John Misty show, and it totally wiped them out. Your drinks might even sit even sit at the bar while the servers take pictures of each other and field compliments on their hats. But what are you going to do? It’s still a fun place to eat. \\nIf we lived nearby, we’d come here once a week - selfie-taking servers and all. We might even post up at the bar on a Friday night and have a few cocktails (and tostones) before heading to Three Diamond Door. We probably wouldn’t text home about our meal, but at least we’d be full and have money left for drinks. In Bushwick, that’s important.']\n"
