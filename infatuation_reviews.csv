",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult.

During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

",2,Russian,Farida,8.0,"There’s a bleak, sweaty place on 34th Street where adults run 60-yard dashes to catch trains to Baltimore, Rangers fans wait in line to buy tallboys in paper bags, and children trip over their Frozen wheely suitcases while chasing indoor sparrows. It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

",4,Korean,Atomix,8.8,"When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, it was just an accident in his lab that he happened to pick up on. And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"

",3,Seafood,Saint Julivert Fisherie,7.7,"When you’re young, you don’t have to think much about your decisions. You just know you shouldn’t attempt the deep end until you’ve graduated from floaties, and you know it’s not worth going to the Yachty Or Naughty party in college if you didn’t go to the pregame. But when you get older, those easy decisions are replaced with existential dread over questions like “Should we move in together?,” “Should I get bangs?,” or “Should I go to that place for dinner tonight?” 
If “that place” is Saint Julivert Fisherie, we can make your decision easier. To enjoy a meal here, you should already love seafood, you should be interested in trying unusual wines, and you should be prepared to spend more money than you might expect in a place with exclusively backless stools.
Saint Julivert is the latest spot from the people behind El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, the excellent Cobble Hill restaurant that happens to be right next door. The menu is mostly small-ish plates inspired by what you’d find in coastal areas around the world, ideally meant to be shared while working your way through the cocktail and wine list. If you’re already running low on vacation days for the year, this is a good opportunity to take a trip to Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and whatever landlocked state tuna casserole comes from, all in one dinner.That casserole comes in a big cast iron pan, and tastes like the kind of comfort you forget you can find in New York City. There’s also whipped mackerel, which turns out to be an extremely good thing to spread on grilled bread, ceviche that comes with fried saltines for scooping, and an excellent steak sandwich that you can opt to stuff with fried oysters. All of these dishes are examples of Saint Julivert at its best: when it’s a low-key place to eat unexpected but unfussy food. The wine menu is a tight list of esoteric options, categorized by the ocean closest to each vineyard, and at first it reads like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. But your anxiety symptoms will go away once you start chatting with the wine guy, who will pour you tastes as he tells you about the work trips that inspired his choices of reds from the Duoro and Manzanillas from Cadiz. Everyone needs work trips like his work trips.
But Saint Julivert doesn’t always feel as relaxed as we wish it did. On visits when we couldn’t find a friendly server to give us wine recommendations, and we ordered too many of the daintier dishes, the place came across more like a minimalist bar serving expensive, austere food. The hamachi collar tastes good, but it comes out alarmingly charred, like it got blown up on its way from the ocean to your plate. The bowl of posole has a ton of flavor, but too few shrimp considering it’s $21. The raw scallops are excellent, but there are only three of them, each served in a tiny shiso leaf, so you eat them like tacos that made cameos in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. The bar and high tops are all shiny silver, the lighting is a little fluorescent, and sometimes there’s no music, so it’s not impossible to feel like you’re eating a $24 half-avocado filled with crab in a very trendy doctor’s office. 
Those are the things you should be aware of before heading to Saint Julivert. You should also know that overall, we like this place a lot. If you’re looking for somewhere to catch up with your friend who would be excited about eating pickled wild shrimp and gooseneck barnacles, or you have an early-in-the-game date when you want to impress someone by casually ordering Spanish sherry, Saint Julivert is a great choice. You’ll have to decide for yourself about your bangs."

It’s called Penn Station, and you probably try to avoid spending too much time there. But walk one block west and four blocks north, and you’ll find a little restaurant that feels about as different from that place as humanly possible. With its relaxed atmosphere and excellent Central Asian food, Farida is a spot you’ll actually want to hang out in.
Every angle of this small, one-room restaurant is decorated with murals or objects ranging from pistols in holsters to a portrait of a young girl in a snowy mountain setting petting a fawn. But watercolor animals aside, the best part of the room is the TV in the corner, where they’re constantly playing Uzbek music videos. It’s like Uzbek TRL, and you probably won’t be able to turn away.The menu has dishes from a few different cuisines, including Russian (pickled herring and borsht), Georgian (really good rice and lamb rib soup), and Uzbek (most of the rest of the food). If you’re not a meat-eater, you’ll be missing out on the best things here - namely the tender beef and lamb that come in soups, on swordlike skewers, and in the Uzbek plov (a rice pilaf dish we love). Everything is simply seasoned and presented, usually with some fresh dill on top, and most dishes come with chickpeas, pickled vegetables, and a piece of thick homemade bread on the side. You can’t really go wrong, but a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t come to Farida and not order the manti. These flat, circular dumplings come stuffed with either beef or pumpkin, and would make extremely nice throw pillows on an edible couch. 
You’re not going to find any ticket-holder-only waiting lounges (where no one checks tickets) or giant plastic-wrapped chocolate chip muffins here, but one similarity between Penn Station and Farida is that they’re both extremely casual. While you can’t quite go to Farida, use your suitcase as a chair, and read an issue of Us Weekly (a.k.a. the height of Penn Station elegance), you can show up here whenever, wearing anything from work clothes to gym clothes, and with concrete plans to spend no more than around $20."

",2,Sushi,U-Gu,7.7,"New York is near an ocean with plenty of free fish just asking to be caught, so theoretically, we should have an abundance of affordable seafood. Unfortunately, that isn’t how life works, and great, not-crazy-expensive neighborhood sushi can feel like some kind of mythical beast. But unlike centaurs, hippogriffs, or any other creature invented by the horse-obsessed people of ancient times, this type of sushi does in fact exist. If you want proof, go to U-Gu. 
U-Gu is a Japanese restaurant in the bottom of a glass-and-steel building in Clinton Hill, and from the outside it looks like something you’d find in a strip mall next to a Cinnabon and a Lady Foot Locker. But it’s actually a charming little space where you’ll want to hang out, drink sake, and eat some high-quality seafood without having to bring a bribe-sized bag of cash.
You come here to eat either sushi or sashimi, and there are a few basic combos like a six-piece sushi set (for $18) and a $26 sashimi plate that comes with enough fish to feed a small porpoise. The pieces are large and taste like the fish equivalent of USDA Prime meat, the rice is warm and well-seasoned, and the selections aren’t limited to your basic tuna and yellowtail - you’ll get things like striped bass with shiso, a thick piece of salmon garnished with roasted red pepper, and unagi topped with a tiny fried quail egg. In addition to sushi, there are options like tuna tartare and salmon tataki, as well as some rice bowls and ramen - but you don’t really need to order those, because the sushi is better. If you do want to mix things up a bit, go for the $40 omakase, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and a few little dishes like diced toro in wasabi soy sauce.It’s an impressive meal, especially considering the fact that you could walk into U-Gu wearing pajama bottoms and a Henrik Lundqvist jersey and feel only slightly underdressed. This is a great place for a weeknight dinner with a couple of friends, and with its hardwood floors and abundance of old-timey light fixtures (over 30 by our count), it feels like a nice, vaguely-steampunk antique store. It’s also full of signs with phrases like “Be a warrior not a worrier” and “Dance like no one’s watching” - and if you pretend you’ve never heard these things before, you might even find them inspirational. 
You probably won’t, but that shouldn’t change your opinion of this place. Because even on a Saturday night, you can walk into U-Gu, get seated immediately, and have dinner for roughly the same price as a new hardcover book. In a city where seafood tends to be priced like it was shipped from Tokyo in the back of a gold-plated taxi with the meter running, that might seem improbable. But it’s true. The next time you’re in the area, take advantage."

",3,Spanish,Gato,7.3,"When some things change, they become unrecognizably different. Massive stars collapse into black holes, for example, and caterpillars turn into butterflies. Meanwhile, other things change in certain ways, but stay the same in others. The new iPhone has a better camera, but it still tries to connect you to random wifi networks five times a day. And Lebron James changes teams, but his hairline continues to recede all the same. Then there’s Gato, Bobby Flay’s Mediterranean spot in Noho. It still resembles its 2014 form in some ways, but the food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.
We’ll start with the things about Gato that haven’t changed. It’s still packed most nights, when the horseshoe bar and big, high-ceilinged dining room are filled with dates and groups of people who probably have strong opinions about the best and worst Equinox locations in city. The service is still great, with a server-to-customer ratio similar to the proportion of teachers to students at a Connecticut boarding school. The menu has also primarily remained the same, including mostly Mediterranean food ranging from bar snacks and appetizers like roasted octopus to pastas and entrees like a porterhouse pork chop over polenta.
And some of those dishes are still very enjoyable. There’s a mushroom paella with crispy but not burned rice, which isn’t dry at all due to some oily kale and a runny egg on top. There are also scrambled eggs. Think about the best eggs you’ve ever made, replace the Frank’s Red Hot and whatever bread was on sale on Fresh Direct with romesco sauce and cracker-thin slices of tomato confit toast, and you’ll get a sense for how good the soft, fluffy version here is. And no matter what else you order, make sure to get dessert. Things like blood orange cheesecake and an apple crostata with brown sugar gelato make coming here just for a nightcap a very reasonable option.But many other dishes on the menu are some combination of bland, too salty, and overpriced. The bar snacks, which are little more than your choice of three amuse-bouches for $21, include things like seared yellowtail that is both overcooked and served too cold, and a piquillo pepper filled with raw tuna that tastes like chilled, unflavored Jello. As for the larger plates, the fettuccine fra diavolo is a bit spicy and pretty tasty, but it’s $34 for a small pile of pasta topped with exactly two shrimp. The charred beef is a similarly small portion, and considering the price and size of the dish, it’s reasonable to expect some very high quality meat. And it may well be a premium cut, but there’s no way to tell because it’s topped with blue cheese so dominant it could be paired with wagyu or ground beef and taste about the same.
Gato used to be a celebrity chef restaurant with outstanding food. It’s certainly still a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality has slipped. Now, we’d suggest you sit at the bar with a date and share some crispy potatoes, Spanish wine, and dessert. You might even spot Bobby Flay mingling around the space, but the food doesn’t taste like he’s the one cooking it anymore."

",3,Greek,Kyma,7.3,"Around the time Kyma opened, we heard that Billy Joel had dinner there. And that makes perfect sense for several reasons. First off, the original Kyma is on Long Island, which happens to be the longtime home of Billy Joel. This Greek restaurant in Flatiron is also a little more expensive than we’d like it to be (much like a Billy Joel concert), but has a few greatest hits that make it worthwhile. 
Kyma specializes in seafood, so that’s mostly what you should order here. There are oysters, crab cakes, and a couple of good crudos, but for an appetizer, we especially like the more-filling grilled octopus. At $24, it’s certainly not cheap, but we’d gladly eat several servings of these little charred octopus medallions. Whatever else you choose, be sure to A) avoid the disappointing pasta and B) get a whole roasted fish. There are a few basic varieties like branzino and red snapper, and they come out perfectly cooked, filleted, and large enough to split with one other person.Due in part to the quality of the fish, Kyma is the sort of place where you’ll pretty much always find a crowd - and that’s half of the appeal. The bar up front is usually packed, the space is lively without being irritatingly loud, and it’s a great night-out option for anyone who no longer has Advil and Gatorade for breakfast on weekend mornings. It’s also pretty spacious, with high ceilings and big white walls decorated with what appear to be Greek artifacts, and overall it feels like something you’d find at a nice but slightly cheesy Mediterranean-themed resort.
If you need a kind of sceney, semi-upscale spot for a last-minute dinner, Kyma will work well. Yes, the non-seafood items are hit-or-miss, and everything costs a little more than it should - but reservations aren’t tough, you don’t have to keep your voice down, and you can have some great food if you order correctly. In other words, it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser, much like that Billy Joel tape you found under your seat on your last road trip."

",3,Bar Food,2nd Floor Bar & Essen,7.9,"We have mixed feelings toward secret places. On the one hand, we like being able to tell people about places they don’t know about. It’s good for our self-esteem. But we also feel dumb looking for hidden entrances, and the employees at these kinds of places tend to act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us inside. Fortunately, 2nd Floor Bar & Essen isn’t uptight or difficult to get into, and it earns several bonus points for serving food we’d like to eat daily.
2nd Floor Bar & Essen is a bar from the same people behind 2nd Ave Deli (a classic NYC mini-chain), and it’s located above their location on the Upper East Side. It’s a great spot for drinks and a light meal, and it’s perfect for when you need someplace fun in this neighborhood, but aren’t feeling masochistic enough to go to The Penrose. Seeing as how the lights stay dim and John Mayer occasionally makes a weirdly not-unwelcome appearance on the soundtrack, it’s pretty ideal for date night as well.
To get here, you enter through a door on 75th Street marked with a little neon sign, then head up a flight of stairs to a space that looks like a private club from the 1920s. It has low ceilings and antique light fixtures, and it seems like the kind of place that should have a password, a dress code, and a host who knows your credit score just by looking at you. But it’s laid-back and unpretentious, and it isn’t tough to get a reservation - which is strange, because the food here makes other bars look lazy.The menu is a mix of small plates inspired by Jewish deli classics, like gefilte croquettes, pastrami burgers, and pigs in a blanket that are seasoned like everything bagels. You can also get some creamy deviled eggs topped with pastrami, as well as some excellent blintzes stuffed with shredded duck. But our favorite things here are the meat-heavy sandwiches from the deli downstairs, which are only available during Happy Hour.
As far as we know, this the only semi-hidden bar where you can show up without a reservation, grab a seat, and eat a messy corned beef sandwich while you drink a cocktail with absinthe and Japanese whisky. It’s worth checking out the next time you find yourself between Central Park and the East River, and it’s also a little bit of a secret at the moment. So if you need to impress someone and maybe gain a little self-esteem that’ll come in handy the next time you accidentally drool on yourself at work, suggest 2nd Ave Bar & Essen."

",1,Middle Eastern,Samesa,8.1,"Casual weeknight dinners are rarely memorable. They’re often afterthoughts, when you feel like a tequila-logged sponge that needs to be wrung out, or you’re busy and want the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s three-course dinner chewing gum (without the side effect of turning into a blueberry). But those quick, sometimes-healthy dinners don’t need to be forgettable. Just get food at Samesa.
Samesa is a counter-service Middle Eastern spot in a part of Williamsburg that hasn’t (yet) been overrun by pet-friendly coworking spaces and apartment buildings with rooftop fire pits, and as a result, it’s one of the few fast-casual options east of the BQE. It’s a tiny space, but they make the most of it, with colorful shelves of random grocery items that make you feel like you could be in Venice Beach. Instead of having smoke blown in your face by someone who has been emulating Spicoli since ’85, though, you’ll be hit by smells of roasting chicken and braising lamb from the open kitchen behind the counter.The whole menu is available every day for lunch and dinner, and whether you order the chicken shawarma, the za’atar roasted salmon, or one of the vegetarian options, you’ll get a lot of very enjoyable food for about $15. All of the mains are available as pitas or platters, and we recommend going with a platter, which comes with rice, a couple different spreads, and a mound of pickled vegetables. There’s nothing on the menu you should avoid, but you should begin your relationship with Samesa with the chicken shawarma - a big pile of tender chicken pieces that are slightly charred and covered in bright, acidic and rich, creamy sauces. 
The food is filling and the portions are large, but Samesa is also healthy enough to make you feel less like one of those waste containers marked with a skull and crossbones after last weekend. The platters are all packed with pickled cauliflower and carrots and other things that grow in the dirt, and the vegetarian options are just as enjoyable as the meat-focused ones. If you want to keep things completely non-animal, start with one of the dips - like the avocado hummus or the spicy matbucha - and then get the platter with balls of gooey mashed zucchini inside crunchy, spice-heavy outer shells. 
While Samesa works for takeout or delivery when your body is telling you that it needs vitamins and drawn blinds, the food actually tastes best when it’s served to-stay, still steaming from the kitchen a few feet away. But whether you eat here or in your apartment as you daydream about your couch having built-in airplane trays, this is a casual, mostly-healthy weeknight meal that you’ll remember."

",2,Bar Food,The Polynesian,7.8,"If you enjoy hanging out around Times Square, then you should go to The Polynesian as soon as possible. You can skip the rest of this review, and use the extra time to polish your collection of miniature Statue Of Liberty replicas. If, on the other hand, you tend to avoid the video billboards of Old Navy’s new streetwear collection and the tourists in open-topped busses taking pictures of you like you’re an exotic animal on a safari, we still think you should go to The Polynesian. You just need all the details first.
The Polynesian is a tiki-themed cocktail bar from the people behind Carbone and The Grill. It’s located on the third floor of the Pod Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, and includes four separate indoor areas and a huge outdoor terrace, all of which look like places Jack Sparrow would hang out if he stopped the pirate shenanigans and made a fortune in the shipping industry. Like the other spots from this restaurant group, The Polynesian is both flashy and really enjoyable. And it’s one of our favorite spots for drinks and a light bite in Midtown.This place is primarily a cocktail bar, and while the drinks are expensive - ranging from $17 to $85 for a large format one that serves six people - they’re worth it. They have unusual ingredients like chipotle honey and ube extract, they come in mugs shaped like skulls and treasure chests that you’ll want to smuggle out in your purse, and they’re delicious, which makes it easy to forget that they also have a lot of alcohol in them. On one of our visits, a woman seated near us in the dining room seemed to overlook that fact, at least until she noticed that the flame on top of the drink had set her hair on fire. To her credit (or perhaps as a testament to the effects of absinthe and rum in the same glass), she took it very well and proceeded to finish the three-tiered tower of small plates on her table."

",2,Bar Food,Bar Beau,7.4,"Whether you live nearby or it takes you two subway transfers and a stroke of luck to get there in under an hour, you probably find yourself in need of a casual date spot in Williamsburg fairly often. You could go to a sit-down restaurant, but then you’d risk waiting 20 minutes for the check after your date makes that second comment about the occult. You could also go to a wine bar, but you want to eat something a little more exciting than a $32 charcuterie plate with three slices of day-old baguette. That’s why you should know about Bar Beau, which you can confidently use for any type of low-commitment date night in the neighborhood.
During the day, Bar Beau is just a small storefront across from an elevated section of the BQE where you can grab a coffee or snack. The front room shuts down in the evening, though, and they start serving cocktails and food in a big, attractive lounge in the back. This dark room has candlelit tables in case you want to discuss your hesitations about doggy daycare with a significant other, but there are also plenty of seats at a long marble bar where you can grab drinks with someone who also, coincidentally, never does “this whole Bumble thing.”The space feels equally like a restaurant and a bar, and the food and drink menus also work no matter how you want to use this place. Drink-wise, you’ll find some great cocktails, most of which are infused with unusual ingredients like aloe and poppy seed absinthe, as well as a short but interesting selection of wines, in case you want to try something (a lot) funkier than a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc. Get some small plates to go with your drinks - like the creamy chicken liver mousse with bacon, or scallop corn fritters that taste like briny hushpuppies - and you’ll be very happy.
All of that said, the large plates are disappointing. The broth-less udon tastes like dry cacio e pepe, the skirt steak’s only flavor comes from its thick sauce, and the seafood rice has very little actual seafood. If you’re looking for a full dinner, we’d suggest you head to Llama Inn, Lilia, or Kings County Imperial, which are all within a couple blocks of this place. 
Come to Bar Beau when you want a few high-quality cocktails with someone whose middle name you don’t know yet, or for a late bite after a show at Brooklyn Steel. The music is stuff you’ll want to sing along to, the dark space and strong cocktails will make you lose track of time, and the company, well, that’s up to you."

",2,Chinese,General Deb’s,7.7,"There are movies, and then there are airplane movies. An airplane movie - like The Secret Life of Pets, Ant-Man, or anything starring Diane Lane - is something you might have missed in theaters, but end up thoroughly enjoying. It might not be the best movie you’ve seen all year, but it makes a normal day a little better (despite the surprise sex scenes that your seat neighbor happens to wake up for). And in that way, it’s a lot like General Deb’s.This walk-in only Sichuan restaurant in Bushwick is the ideal place for a casual dinner when you’re in the neighborhood. It’s just one small room with red walls, a sizable bar, and one of our favorite bathrooms in recent memory (featuring a Chinese parasol, a disco ball, and floor-to-ceiling shimmery tiles you’d find in a hot tub). Crowd-wise, it tends to fill up with people who live nearby and want a fun but low-key meal for under $30. Which means it’s quite possible you’ll see your L train crush eating dan dan noodles here, reading Kurt Vonnegut in Spanish.
The menu has a few sections ranging from small plates to noodles, and while we’ve tried plenty of the non-vegetarian entrees, we’ve consistently found that - as with VeggieTales (minus the Jesus stuff) - the green things at General Deb’s are the stars. There’s Chinese broccoli that comes with exactly the right amount of black bean glaze, and a dish of smashed cucumbers tossed in garlicky oil with chili powder on top like sprinkles on a sundae. Then there are the long beans, which are soft and perfectly salty. Get any of those things and some soups and small plates (like the fiery shrimp soup or wontons), and you’ll be set."

",3,Pasta,Misi,8.2,"Perhaps you’ve experienced the following: you’re at an Italian restaurant, considering your order. The starters are pretty non-controversial, but when it comes to a second course, you find yourself at a crossroads. Sure, you could order something sensible, like the branzino or the roast chicken, and then you could go home and spend 30 minutes on the Nordic Trac in the basement before taking your daily vitamins. But your heart is telling you to go all in on pasta, with more bowls than there are people at the table.
At Misi, you’ll be free from this existential crisis, because the menu at this Williamsburg restaurant (from the people behind Lilia) only has three sections: vegetables, pasta, and gelato. There’s often a large format off-menu dish, like a steak, but for the most part, protein isn’t part of the Misi food pyramid. This is a pasta restaurant, and one that also serves some good vegetables and some incredible gelato. It’s not as good as Lilia, but then again, few places are.
While you won’t need to decide whether you’re going to eat pasta here, you will need to decide which of the 10 pastas you want to order. And you should take this decision-making process seriously. Our advice here is to prioritize the simple, not-too-saucy pastas like the cacio e pepe-esque fettuccine or the tortelli with brown butter. These two in particular are fantastic, and on par with the pastas at Lilia. Follow that with something like the spaghetti with fennel pesto or the rigatoni. These are also quite good. The seafood-y pastas, like the linguine with anchovy, the malloredus with clams, and the ricotta-filled occhi with bottarga, have consistently been our least favorite, which is surprising, because they sound great on paper. While some of them can be interesting for a few bites, they’re just too intense to finish a whole bowl.The vegetable antipasti, of which there are also 10, are tasty, and you should get at least one per person of those to start. They tend to lean heavy on vinegar and pickled flavors, so know to expect things like marinated leeks and peppers, and not light salads to start out your meal. And then there’s the gelato, which may actually be Misi’s best course. If Misi opened a gelato stand, it would have a line around the block, and we’d be in it, waiting for a cup of the mint stracciatella. This is some of the best ice cream in New York.
You’ll eat your pasta, vegetables, and gelato in the ground floor of a high-end condo building by the water in Williamsburg, in a space that can feel energetic and fun at times, and high-end condo-ish at others. It doesn’t have the charm of Lilia’s former auto body shop space, but once again, few places do. If you can manage to get a reservation, it’s a fun place for a Friday night date or a Wednesday night let’s-eat-pasta-and-drink-wine-because-we-can meet up. In either of those situations, you’ll likely sit at the long counter overlooking the open kitchen, watching pasta get made and gelato get scooped, which makes for an entertaining show.
Misi is straightforward to begin with, and it’s at its best when it keeps things almost ridiculously simple - so stick to straightforward dishes like the fettuccine and mint gelato, and you’ll enjoy yourself. Just like you’ll enjoy not having to pretend you wanted to share a branzino."

",2,Indian,Adda,8.2,"We’re about 90% certain that New York City is a virtual simulation designed to test everyone’s patience - so it makes sense that nothing here is perfect. Apartments are either offensively priced or so small that you can’t stand upright and have a complete thought, and worthwhile restaurants tend to fall on a spectrum between impossible to get into and a little bit boring. There are, of course, exceptions, and Adda is one of them.
Adda is a neighborhood restaurant in Long Island City focused on regional Indian home cooking, and it checks a large number of boxes on our Ideal Restaurant Checklist. The food is good enough to travel for, but nothing costs more than $20, and it’s BYOB. The only real catch is that it’s stuck between a busy stretch of Queens Boulevard and a big overpass that looks like the future setting of a zombie apocalypse. But a meal here is still worth seeking out.
The menu isn’t long, but it covers a lot of ground. Yes, there’s garlic naan and saag paneer, but there’s also goat brains, deep-fried kale, and cauliflower covered in sheets of melted cheese. And if you want something bigger, there are curries and rice dishes that will make you consider investing in real estate across the street. The goat biryani is especially impressive - with a thin cap of dough that keeps all the steam inside until a server carves it open at your table - and the creamy butter chicken tastes and smells so good, you’ll want to go online and find a butter-chicken-scented candle for your home.All of these dishes make for some pretty good drinking food, and that’s why you’ll see most tables here covered in everything from wine to six packs of beer from the 7-Eleven next door. Depending on the kind of night you’re trying to have, either beverage option works, although you should be sure to bring a friend or three to help you eat and drink everything. The space is just one narrow room that fills up quickly, but you can always make a reservation.
Seeing as there aren’t many bars nearby where you can camp out after you put your name in for a table, reservations are the safest option. And it shouldn’t be too hard to get one, despite the fact that you can have an excellent sit-down meal here for less than $25 a head. Even considering the somewhat bleak location, Adda feels almost too good to be true - and now that you’re aware of this particular glitch in the current NYC simulation, you should make plans to take advantage of it."

",4,Japanese,Toriko,8.3,"We order chicken a lot. It’s not that we have a particular fondness for the meat of this flightless bird, or that chicken is some kind of delicacy (it tends to be the third most common thing at neighborhood restaurants, behind reclaimed wood and playlists heavy on Arcade Fire). We order it because it’s a good clue as to whether a place is worth your time and money. We order chicken in the hope of having an experience like Toriko.
Toriko is the first US outpost of a yakitori mini-chain with more than a dozen locations in Japan. It serves two omakase menus ($65 and $85), both of which focus on grilled chicken skewers. If grilled chicken on sticks makes you think mostly of summer BBQs and lukewarm Dos Equis, know that this West Village spot feels less like your cousin’s backyard and more like a high-end sushi restaurant. The dining room mainly consists of a bright, wooden counter with about 20 seats overlooking an elevated grill, where a chef rotates skewers like he’s on a stage playing the xylophone. After each one is put on your plate, the chef watches you with a look that makes you feel like you should exaggerate a smile and head nod to assure him you’re enjoying every bite. But no exaggeration is necessary.Both tasting menu options center on six chicken skewers that, from the first bite, will make you question how chicken can even taste this good. The skewers vary nightly, but you can expect things like soft and salty chicken neck, wasabi-topped tenderloin, and juicy chicken hearts. Then there’s the thigh meat, which has so much flavor that the idea of a neutron star the size of Manhattan having more mass than the sun will finally seem feasible to you. And if chicken oysters (pieces of dark meat located near the thigh) aren’t part of the night’s omakase, make sure to get some a la carte at the end of your meal - the meat is charred, juicy, and almost confusingly tender.
If the other courses at Toriko were as enjoyable as the yakitori, there’d be almost nothing to criticize. But they’re hit-or-miss. There are excellent appetizers, like a chicken bone broth that almost makes you want to get sick so you can request a bucket of it in bed - but also some less enjoyable dishes, like a savory egg custard that tastes like it’s been infused with too many pumps of movie theater butter. Considering the difference between the two menus is just the addition of a few non-chicken items, the $65 option is definitely the way to go. Even without the bites of wagyu and the bowl of ramen that are included in the more expensive menu, you still get plenty of food.
The best way to enjoy dinner here is to sit at the counter and drink something from the long, mostly-French wine list as you watch a chef apply fresh wasabi to still-smoking skewers with the attention of someone playing high-stakes Jenga. This dinner theater makes Toriko ideal for dates, but no matter who joins you, two things are for certain: you’re going to order chicken, and you’re going to be very happy you did."

",2,American,Bernie’s,8.1,"When you walk into Bernie’s, it’ll look strangely familiar. You might even think you’ve been here before. You’ll see the checkered tablecloths, the red vinyl booths, the fake-stained-glass light fixtures, and the servers in embroidered polos holding trays of frosted beer mugs and sauce-covered baby back ribs. And then it’ll dawn on you: you’re inside a Brooklyn parody of Cheers. Or maybe TGI Fridays. 
But just take a seat in one of those booths. Maybe it’ll be once you start chatting with your friendly server, or maybe it’ll be when you order a martini and it comes out perfectly cold, or maybe it’ll be once you’re halfway through your mozzarella sticks - but inevitably, you’ll figure out that this isn’t some irony-laced theme restaurant that’s here to provide a photo opportunity. Bernie’s is here to give you a genuinely good time.Bernie’s is from the same team behind Frankel’s, another Greenpoint spot that serves both food and nostalgia. In Bernie’s case, it’s nostalgia for the kind of American restaurant with uncomplicated food and no pretension. Places you went to after soccer practice when you were a kid, or see bad commercials for on TV and think to yourself, “huh, that actually looks kinda good.” Places where a wedge salad counts as a vegetable, where the hardest question you’ll face is whether you’re getting the steak or the burger, and where you’re absolutely getting the sundae for dessert. 
To be clear, Bernie’s has much better food (and much less corporate despair) than any restaurant that advertises on TV. But it’s the smaller details here that make Bernie’s a place where you want to hang out. It’s the crayons and butcher paper on every table so you can play hangman (which turns out to be more fun with alcohol), and the little silver bowl of crushed ice that makes the shrimp cocktail feel even more festive than your average shrimp cocktail. It’s the garden gnome-sized brownie sundae that might be made with grocery store ice cream, but is also covered with at least six inches of whipped cream. And it’s the frozen mugs, which will make you wonder why we don’t drink all beer out of frozen mugs.
So while Bernie’s might seem like the set for a TV show about a restaurant in 1983, that’s not what’s important here. What’s important is that groups are ordering repeat rounds of martinis and mozzarella sticks, regulars are posted up watching sports at the bar, and friendly staff are acting like they already know everyone’s name. None of those elements are unique on their own, but together they form a restaurant unlike many others in the city. Although, full disclosure, we haven’t been to the Times Square TGI Fridays."

And when the Greeks conquered Troy, it was only because Odysseus noticed that the Trojans were dumb and would definitely fall for a fake-horse trick. In other words, attention to detail is important. It can change history, or, in the case of Atomix, it can make a meal that much more exceptional.
Atomix is a restaurant in Nomad from the people behind Atoboy, and it does a $175 10-course Korean tasting menu. Considering the price, it isn’t the kind of place where you’ll go once a month, or (probably) even once a year - but the food is genuinely excellent, and beyond that, there a lot of little details that make this place worth your money for a very special night out.
To get here, you walk up the steps of a small residential building on East 30th Street and ring an unmarked doorbell. A host then walks you through an upstairs bar and down a set of stairs to a lounge-like area with a U-shaped counter surrounded by 14 chairs. Next, a few snacks arrive, and then you get to pick your own chopsticks from a tray of about nine different pairs. Every set is unique, and the act of choosing feels like a brief personality quiz, or a few moments with the Hogwarts Sorting Hat.Once that’s done, your dinner officially begins, and every course starts with a notecard. These notecards don’t just tell you in broad terms what you’re about to be eating - each one has an incredibly specific breakdown of every single ingredient in a dish (down to water and xanthan gum). There’s also a brief essay on the inspiration behind the dish, and even the Instagram handle of the person who made the actual plate. Like all the other details that go into a meal here, it’s thoughtful without ever seeming gimmicky, and it helps you further appreciate your food in the same way that an Elizabethan dictionary helps you fully comprehend a Shakespearean insult.
The courses themselves start small and chilled, then gradually turn into more substantial things like lightly battered wagyu, a tender piece of fish over foie gras with tiny orbs of squash, and some bite-sized slices of perfectly cooked duck with a side of Korean-inspired mole. The dishes are complex and attractive, but you don’t feel like you’re desecrating a piece of modern art when you eat them - and, more importantly, everything tastes very, very good. Considering the $175 price tag, you might think that’s a given, but with fancy tasting menus, things sometimes tend to be more interesting than they are delicious.
That’s just one more reason why Atomix is not your typical tasting-menu spot. You’ll want seconds of every dish, and you’ll never wonder exactly what it is that you’re putting in your mouth - because the notecards walk you through everything like a friendly tour guide, or that paperclip from old versions of Microsoft Word. At the end of the night, you get to take all your notecards home in a custom envelope - and after a meal this special, it’s nice having a meaningful souvenir that isn’t just a copy of the check."

",4,Japanese,Shabushabu Macoron,8.6,"The next time you’re standing in a group of people, try telling them that you heard there’s a place in Bushwick where you can pay to do karaoke inside a couple’s house. Regardless of whether this is a real thing or not (it actually is, though), we can predict it will quickly feel like you own a people magnet. The intrigued group will demand to know who/what/where/how and “really”? This is not because people are seeking out new opportunities to do karaoke or to go to strangers’ homes. It’s because truly unique experiences in New York City are exceedingly rare. So when you hear about an interesting one, you’ll want to listen up. Which means you should be listening closely right now.
Shabushabu Macoron is unique in almost every sense, starting with the fact that it’s the only shabushabu omakase restaurant in the world. While other Japanese shabushabu places have diners cook slices of meat and vegetables in a hotpot themselves, at Shabushabu Macoron, one chef prepares a $128 multi-course meal for the eight people in each seating, featuring everything from uni broth to super high-end wagyu beef, while Adele plays on repeat over the speakers. It is unique, yes, and it’s also extremely fun and delicious.
Once you’ve gotten settled and overheard the guy next to you saying he’s been here six times in six weeks, you’ll start with a few small dishes, like a cup of hot sake paired with sea urchin, omelette with scallop, sea urchin with tofu skin, and homemade cold tofu. You’ll get your first taste of the chef (one woman named Mako) cooking shabushabu for you, with pieces of abalone cooked in a sea urchin broth. This might be a good time to mention that you should probably have at least a mild appreciation for sea urchin if you’re thinking about coming here.From there, you’ll move onto the main event: the shabushabu hotpot segment of the meal. At this point, a spread of beef, pork, and vegetables will be presented in front of you, along with a big pot of boiling water and a range of sauces. There’s ponzu, soy sauce, spinach sauce, olive oil and onion sauce, tomato sauce, and gravy. Meanwhile, the third Ed Sheeran song of the night is playing, and somehow, that completely works.
Super thin, super marbled slices of beef and pork will now be whished through the water for you with extreme precision, and for the first few rounds, suggested sauce pairings will also be offered. You’re welcome to freestyle at any point, but things start to happen so quickly at this point - here’s one type of wagyu with ponzu, and another type with olive oil and onion, and oh wait, now there’s an incredible mushroom - that you’ll be happy to take orders just to keep up.  While you’re finishing that pork with sesame sauce, there’s a steaming hot mochi-based spinach dumpling that just showed up in front of you. Wait, how is one chef managing to also cook for seven other people? How is it possible for things to happen so quickly but also feel extremely calm? How is this food so good?"
